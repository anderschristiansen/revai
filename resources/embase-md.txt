Abstract
  The vascular system regulates brain clearance through arterial blood flow and lymphatic drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), characterized by elevated intracranial pressure and dural venous sinus stenoses, can be treated by restoring venous blood flow via venous stenting, suggesting a role for venous blood flow in brain fluid clearance. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in IIH patients and healthy controls, we identified that dural venous stenoses in IIH were associated with impaired lymphatic drainage, perivenous fluid retention, and brain fluid accumulation. To investigate this further, we developed a mouse model with bilateral jugular vein ligation (JVL), which recapitulated key human findings, including intracranial hypertension, calvarial lymphatic regression, and brain swelling due to impaired clearance. To further dissect the respective roles of dural lymphatics and venous blood flow in brain clearance, we performed JVL in mice with dural lymphatic depletion. These mice exhibited spontaneous elevated intracranial pressure, but JVL did not further exacerbate this effect. Moreover, the synchronous restoration of brain clearance and dural lymphatics observed in mice after JVL was absent in lymphatic-deficient mice.Transcriptomic analyses revealed that lymphatic remodeling induced by JVL was driven by VEGF-C signaling between dural mesenchymal and lymphatic endothelial cells. These findings establish the dural venous sinuses as a critical platform where venous blood flow interacts with mesenchymal cells to preserve dural lymphatic integrity and function, essential for brain fluid clearance.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Abstract
  Background: Growing evidence suggests that for rodents, a substantial fraction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drains by crossing the cribriform plate into the nasopharengeal lymphatics, eventually reaching the cervical lymphatic vessels (CLVs). Disruption of this drainage pathway is associated with various neurological disorders. Method(s): We employ a lumped parameter method to numerically model CSF drainage across the cribriform plate to CLVs. Our model uses intracranial pressure as an inlet pressure and central venous blood pressure as an outlet pressure. The model incorporates initial lymphatic vessels (modeling those in the nasal region) that absorb the CSF and collecting lymphatic vessels (modeling CLVs) to transport the CSF against an adverse pressure gradient. To determine unknown parameters such as wall stiffness and valve properties, we utilize a Monte Carlo approach and validate our simulation against recent in vivo experimental measurements. Result(s): Our parameter analysis reveals the physical characteristics of CLVs. Our results suggest that the stiffness of the vessel wall and the closing state of the valve are crucial for maintaining the vessel size and volume flow rate observed in vivo. We find that a decreased contraction amplitude and frequency leads to a reduction in volume flow rate, and we test the effects of varying the different pressures acting on the CLVs. Finally, we provide evidence that branching of initial lymphatic vessels may deviate from Murray's law to reduce sensitivity to elevated intracranial pressure. Conclusion(s): This is the first numerical study of CSF drainage through CLVs. Our comprehensive parameter analysis offers guidance for future numerical modeling of CLVs. This study also provides a foundation for understanding physiology of CSF drainage, helping guide future experimental studies aimed at identifying causal mechanisms of reduction in CLV transport and potential therapeutic approaches to enhance flow.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Abstract
  Introduction: Intracranial hypotension (IH) is secondary to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, with or without a dural damage. CSVT has occasionally been described in patients with IH and several mechanisms can explain this association: Decreased blood flow velocity by venous engorgement and dilatation; venous endothelium damage induced by negative intracranial pressure gradient; finally increased blood viscosity due to CSF reduced absorption. These can be added to risk factors related to the patient: Hereditary thrombophilia, pregnancy or contraceptive use, prothrombotic drugs and cancer. Case report: A 44-year-old woman was hospitalized for worsening headache. She was affected by peritoneal pseudomyxoma surgically treated and now in chemotherapy (Capecitabine and Bevacizumab). She suffered from headaches and vomiting aggravated by orthostatic position. The cerebral MRI and lumbar puncture excluded meningeal carcinomatosis and a diagnosis of CSF hypotension was made. A blood patch procedure was performed without benefit and a subsequent cerebral CT scan documented a CSVT extended from sagittal upper venous sinus to right internal jugular vein, consistent with the symptoms. She began subcutaneous heparin with improvement of headache. Conclusion(s): The CSVT is a multifactorial condition determined by local and generalizated risk factors: The thrombophilic substrate linked to cancer and the concomitant treatment with prothrombotic drugs, as well as the associated venous stasis induced by IH. IH therefore, spontaneous or acquired, can be considered a risk factor for CSVT.

Abstract
  A generation of doctors has been taught that Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) can be diagnosed definitively by a triad of [1] retinal hemorrhage, [2] meningeal hemorrhage (subdural or subarachnoid) and [3] encephalopathy. SBS, not really syndromic, is unravelling, and has been supplanted by Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) by its proponents. Yet fundamental problems remain with the idea. The physics of angular acceleration provides only 11-12% of that necessary to cause destructive shear force within the brain. The fulcrum around which the brain would rotate is not the center of the head (as in boxing), but inferiorly in the neck, which has been injured in no case of presumptive SBS/AHT. Commonly, there is little to no differential diagnosis by child abuse specialists in court asserting there is only one possible diagnosis: abuse. There are a multitude of causes of the triad. Reperfusion hemorrhage after resuscitation following cardiac arrest accounts for many cases, due to reperfusion of previously hypoxic or ischemic endothelium. SBS and SIDS show a remarkable graphic superposition in month-over-month incidence plots, suggesting resuscitation in SIDS may turn it into SBS if reperfusion hemorrhage occurs. Another mimic of what passes for SBS/AHT is a short fall. Usually innocuous, short falls have a strike velocity of >5 mph from a 12h fall, and 10 mph from a 44h fall and can give rise to fractures and/or subdural hematomas, if the head strikes first. Lucid intervals can occur in young children, but are discounted in SBS/AHT circles. Retinal hemorrhages result from ICP via the valveless venous system transmitting the pressure from the cerebral venous system to retinal veins. Differential diagnosis in law is termed due process, often lacking in SBS/AT cases at trial. The problem is confounded further by false confessions. Research on normal subjects shows that, if given cogent background data and a medical certainty they were guilty, people will admit to a factitious crime they never committed. These multiple, system-wide errors converge to cause incarceration of parents, day care workers and grandparents, presently numbering over 1000 imprisonments. Prosecutions based on the triad continue.

Abstract
  Background: Shunt systems for hydrocephalus therapy are commonly based on passive mechanical pressure valves that are driven by the intracranial, intra-abdominal, and hydrostatic pressure. The differential pressure acting on the valve determines the drainage rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but is not a gauge of the physiological condition of the patient. Internal and external influences can cause over- or underdrainage and lead to pathological levels of intracranial pressure (ICP). Method(s): The first prototype of a ventricular intelligent and electromechanical shunt (VIEshunt) is developed, tested, and compared with previous efforts towards the development of a smart shunt. Its key components are a micro pump, a flow meter, a pressure sensor, an inertial measurement unit, a wireless communication interface, and a microcontroller. The VIEshunt prototype was tested in vitro using a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) test bench that runs real-time patient simulations involving changes in intracranial and intra-abdominal pressure, as well as changes in posture ranging between supine and upright position. The prototype was subsequently tested in an in vivo pilot study based on an acute ovine animal model (n=1) with infusions of artificial CSF. Result(s): During 24 h in vitro testing, the prototype detected the simulated posture changes of the patient and automatically adapted the controller reference. The posture-specific ICP references of 12 mmHg for supine and -3 mmHg for upright position were tracked without offset, thus preventing adverse over- and underdrainage during the investigated HiL test scenario. During acute in vivo testing, the prototype first regulated the mean ICP of a sheep from 22 mmHg down to 20 mmHg. Each of the three subsequent intraventricular bolus infusions of 1 mL saline solution increased mean ICP by approximately 11 mmHg. While natural absorption alone decreased ICP by only 5 mmHg within 9 min, the prototype was able to regulate ICP back to the pre-bolus pressure value within 5 min. Conclusion(s): The developed VIEshunt prototype is capable of posture-dependent ICP regulation and CSF drainage control. Smart shunt systems based on VIEshunt could improve patient monitoring and enable optimal physiologic therapy by adapting to the individual patient. To derive statistically relevant conclusions for the performance of VIEshunt, future work will focus on the development of a next generation prototype for use in pre-clinical studies.Copyright © The Author(s) 2025.

Abstract
  Background: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from the formation of a thrombus in the venous sinuses in the brain, resulting in impaired venous drainage, increased intracranial pressure, and severe neurological deficits. Traumatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but potentially devastating complication of head trauma. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis can present with a variety of symptoms including headache, vomiting, blurred vision, loss of consciousness, seizures, and coma. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is a complication of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis that occurs due to raised intracranial pressure, which in turn stimulates antidiuretic hormone release. The diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is confirmed through neuroimaging. Anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment. The prognosis is variable and depends on several factors including the extent of thrombosis, presence of cerebral hemorrhage, and timing of diagnosis and treatment. Case presentation: We report a case of a 45-year-old Albanian female who presented with headache and dizziness following a fall and head strike in the context of influenza A. Computed tomography of the brain revealed a stable minimally displaced oblique fracture of the left petrous bone and new dural venous sinus thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, and cranial aspect of the left internal jugular vein. Thrombotic, malignancy, and infectious screens were negative. Our case was successfully managed with anticoagulants. Additionally, the patient developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, which was managed with fluid restriction. Conclusion(s): Our case highlights the importance of considering cerebral venous sinus thrombosis as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with dizziness following trauma. Early identification with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging venography and appropriate treatment with anticoagulation therapy are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality.Copyright © The Author(s) 2025.

Abstract
  External hydrocephalus is a rare condition characterized by abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation in the subarachnoid space, often associated with developmental anomalies. Lobar holoprosencephaly, a milder form of holoprosencephaly, can manifest with hydrocephalus due to its impact on brain development and CSF dynamics. This case report describes a neonate with congenital external hydrocephalus secondary to lobar holoprosencephaly, highlighting the diagnostic imaging findings and management approach. A neonate presented with progressive macrocephaly, irritability, altered sensorium, and poor feeding. Antenatal ultrasound at 32 weeks of gestation revealed macrocephaly and hydrocephalus, leading to a cesarean delivery at 38 weeks. Physical examination showed an occipitofrontal circumference of 45 cm, exceeding the 97th percentile for age. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed fused frontal horns of the lateral ventricles, hypoplasia of the posterior corpus callosum, and extensive extra-axial CSF accumulation compressing the brain parenchyma. The CSF collection showed complete suppression on FLAIR imaging, confirming its nature, and a cortical vein sign indicated an enlarged subarachnoid space rather than a subdural hygroma. A diagnosis of lobar holoprosencephaly with congenital external hydrocephalus was made. The patient underwent peritoneal shunting to alleviate intracranial pressure, significantly reducing head circumference to 38 cm. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the parents were counseled on genetic testing and long-term follow-up. This case underscores the importance of detailed neuroimaging in differentiating external hydrocephalus from other pathologies and highlights the role of surgical intervention in improving outcomes. Early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach are vital for managing complex congenital anomalies such as lobar holoprosencephaly.Copyright © 2025

Abstract
  Parasagittal meningiomas (PSM) represent one of the most frequently encountered intracranial meningiomas and pose unique challenges given their intimate relationship with parasagittal bridging veins and superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Compromise of venous drainage during resection might be a source of significant postoperative complications including catastrophic intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Objective of this study was to identify postoperative complications and associated factors predisposing to their development. A retrospective review of histologically confirmed parasagittal meningiomas (Sindou grade 1-6) resected between 2011 and 2020 was performed. A total of 62 patients (35 females (56.45%); mean age 55.72) years were included. The mean follow-up was 40.84 months. Forty-two patients (67.74%) were treatment naive. Complete SSS occlusion was noted in 23 (37.1%). WHO grade 1 tumor was diagnosed in 32 (51.61%), WHO 2 in 23 (37.1%) and WHO 3 in 7 cases (11.29%). The SSS was resected in 24 (38.71%) patients. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (ICH) was noted after 8 (12.90%) surgeries. Prior surgery (p = 0.006, OR = 22.1; 95% CI = 2.48-196.5) and higher tumor grade (OR = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.45-14.79, p = 0.01) were independently associated with greater risk of ICH. Resection of the SSS was not associated with postoperative ICH (p = 0.1388). A procedure-related mortality was noted in 2 patients (3.2%). Long term postoperative headaches were reported in 14 (22.58%) patients, associated with the resection of the SSS (p = 0.0003). Four (6.56%) patients had a CSF diversion procedure noted at the last follow up, correlated with ICH (p = 0.0124). History of prior surgery and higher WHO grade seem to be correlated with a significantly elevated risk of hemorrhage. Increased intracranial pressure, requiring CSF diversion is relatively infrequent occurring only in 6% patients, however awareness is important as prevention of its sequela is straightforward, preventing debilitating morbidity.Copyright © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.

Abstract
  Background: Inflammation plays a critical role in severe cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) pathogenesis, but the benefits of anti-inflammatory therapies remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between steroid therapy combined with anticoagulation and the prognosis of acute/subacute severe CVT patients. Method(s): A prospective cohort study enrolled patients with acute/subacute severe CVT at Xuanwu Hospital (July 2020-January 2024). Patients were allocated into steroid and non-steroid groups based on the treatment they received. Functional outcomes (modified Rankin scale [mRS]) were evaluated at admission, discharge, and 6 months after discharge. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-6, and intracranial pressure were measured at admission and discharge in the steroid group. Fundoscopic Frisen grades were assessed at admission and 6 months after discharge. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyses were used to evaluated associations between steroid use and favorable outcomes (mRS <=2) at the 6-month follow-up. Paired tests assessed changes in hs-CRP and other variables before and after treatment, and Spearman's correlations were used to analyzed relationships between these changes and functional improvements. Result(s): A total of 107 and 58 patients in the steroid and non-steroid groups, respectively, were included in the analysis. Compared with the non-steroid group, the steroid group had a higher likelihood of achieving an mRS score of 0-2 (93.5% vs. 82.5%, OR = 2.98, P = 0.037) at the 6-month follow-up. After adjusting for confounding factors, the result remained consistent. Pulsed steroid therapy did not increase mortality during hospitalization or follow-up, nor did it lead to severe steroid-related complications (all P >0.05). Patients in the steroid group showed a significant reduction in serum hs-CRP, IL-6, CSF IL-6, and intracranial pressure at discharge compared to at admission, as well as a significant reduction in the fundoscopic Frisen grade at the 6-month follow-up compare to at admission (all P <0.001). A reduction in serum inflammatory marker levels during hospitalization positively correlated with improvements in functional outcomes (P <0.05). Conclusion(s): Short-term steroid use may be an effective and safe adjuvant therapy for acute/subacute severe CVT when used alongside standard anticoagulant treatments, which are likely due to suppression of the inflammatory response. However, these findings require further validation in randomized controlled trials.Copyright © 2025 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer, Inc.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Growing evidence suggests that venous outflow obstruction from venous sinus stenosis (VSS) may lead to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). There is a paucity of evidence examining clinical predictors of elevated cerebral venous pressure gradient (CVPG) from VSS in patients with IIH. In this study, the authors examined predictors of elevated CVPG, determined the sensitivity and specificity of common presenting symptoms of IIH, and identified the optimal opening pressure threshold on lumbar puncture (LP) to determine which patients should undergo venous manometry (VM). METHOD(S): Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, complications, and opening pressure on LP were collected. Venous pressure gradient across a stenotic dural venous sinus and maximum venous pressure values were recorded from cerebral venograms. VM was considered positive when the CVPG was >= 8 mm Hg between two contiguous segments of a dural venous sinus. Sensitivity, specificity, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULT(S): The predominant patient population was young (mean age 38.9 years), obese (BMI >= 30; 83.8%), and female (95.0%). Sensitivity and specificity for papilledema were 74% and 70% (area under the curve [AUC] 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.80), and 70% and 63% (AUC 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.75) for pulsatile tinnitus. Vision changes demonstrated a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 50% (AUC 0.63, 95% CI 0.54-0.72). VSS seen on magnetic resonance venography (MRV) demonstrated a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 53% (AUC 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.79). Youden's index analysis identified an opening pressure >= 25 cm H2O on LP (AUC 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.83) as an optimal threshold for predicting elevated CVPG. CONCLUSION(S): Predictors of elevated CVPG on VM include childbearing age, African American race, papilledema, pulsatile tinnitus, obesity (BMI >= 30), focal VSS with unilateral dominance in venous drainage seen on MRV, or an opening pressure on LP >= 25 cm H2O.

Abstract
  Background: Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) is an alternate mode of ventilation in acute respiratory failure (ARF), but there is inconsistent data to support its use over other modes of ventilation. Because of increased intrathoracic pressure for most of the respiratory cycle, a negative impact of APRV on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) has been hypothesized. We evaluated the effects of APRV ventilation, with particular attention to ICP, CPP and ICP-directed therapy, in a real-world cohort of neuro-ICU patients. Method(s): Retrospective single-center analysis from January 2021 to December 2023 of neurosurgical ICU patients with ICP monitoring. APRV was used as a rescue mode at the physician's discretion when the Horovitz index (PaO2/FIO2 ratio) fell below 150 despite optimized conventional ventilation. Result(s): Between 2021 and 2023, APRV was utilized in 29 patients undergoing a total of 60 episodes. Forty patients (66.7%) were female, median age was 49.5 (Q1 34; Q3 61.25) years. After transition to APRV, mean FiO2 decreased by 4.3% (t = 3.5, p <.001) and mean PaO2 increased by 22.7 mm Hg (t = 4.2, p <.001). The Horovitz index improved by 44.6 mm Hg (t = 4.9, p <.001). Mean compliance did not differ after transition to APRV (-1.5 ml/mbar, t = -0.9, p =.4). During the APRV episode, mean ICP was 1.2 mm Hg lower (t = 2.6, p =.01), while mean CPP was 1.6 mm Hg higher (t = -0.9, p =.4) and the intensity of ICP-directed therapy (TIL) was significantly lower (X2= 92.771, p <.001). Conclusion(s): APRV was hemodynamically tolerated in 29 out of 33 patients, and was safe with regard to ICP, CPP, and the intensity of ICP-directed therapy. Oxygenation was increased by APRV. 4 out of 33 patients would not tolerate APRV for hemodynamic reasons, APRV therefore was stopped immediately.Copyright © The Author(s) 2025.

Abstract
  Background: Active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ACD-CPR) combined with an impedance threshold device (ITD) and controlled headup positioning, collectively termed AHUP-CPR, is associated with improved outcomes compared with conventional CPR (C-CPR). Active decompression (AD) forcibly lifts the anterior chest wall with suction after each compression, while the ITD simultaneously impedes airflow into the lungs. AD and ITD synergistically lower intrathoracic pressure during decompression, improving venous return, ventricular refilling and cardiac output. Concurrently, head-up positioning lowers intracranial pressures and improves cardiac preload. This pig study focused on the physiological role of AD during AHUP-CPR, simulating real clinical scenarios. Method(s): Ten male and female farm pigs (~40 kg) were anesthetized, intubated and ventilated. Hemodynamic parameters, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), and biventricular pressure-volume loops were recorded continuously. Ventricular fibrillation was induced and left untreated for 10 mins. Then, after 2 min of automated C-CPR in the flat position, AHUP-CPR with a 3 cm lift above the neutral position of the chest was performed for 13 min. AD was then abruptly discontinued, restarted 1 min later, and increased incrementally every min to up to 4 cm of active lift. Data were analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model, using random intercepts for individual pigs. Result(s): Upon cessation of AD, coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures, compression and decompression aortic pressures, compression right atrial pressure, ETCO2, right and left ventricular preload, compliance, stroke volume and cardiac output all decreased immediately and significantly (p<0.01), whereas decompression right atrial and biventricular pressures increased. With restoration of AD, physiological parameters returned to >= 90% of pre-AD discontinuation values (Figures 1 and 2). Conclusion(s): Full chest wall lift, achieved with >3 cm of AD, was needed to maintain and optimize hemodynamics during AHUP-CPR in pigs. After pausing AD, incremental restoration of AD resulted in nearly complete restoration of peripheral and central hemodynamic measures. These observations support the benefit of and need for >=3 cm of AD to optimize AHUP-CPR. Effective means to generate >=3 cm of AD should be considered when implementing and developing AHUP-CPR devices to optimize outcomes. (Figure Presented).

Abstract
  Background: Spontaneous gasping or agonal respiration during cardiac arrest is an auto-resuscitative reflex. Patients who gasp during cardiac arrest have better outcomes, regardless of the presenting rhythm. The physiological effects of gasping are similar to taking a deep breath: intrathoracic and intracranial pressure decrease, respiratory gas enters the lungs, venous blood refills the right ventricle (RV). Impedance threshold device (ITD) resistance to inspiration, with or without CPR, further reduces intrathoracic pressure. This study tested the hypothesis that gasping during untreated ventricular fibrillation (VF) would increase left ventricular (LV) and RV pressure and volume, and that ITD use would accentuate these effects. Method(s): 13 male and female pigs were anesthetized, intubated and mechanically ventilated. VF was induced and left untreated for 10 minutes. Hemodynamics, including biventricular pressure and volume loops using intracardiac conductance catheters were recorded during spontaneous gasping. An ITD, attached to the endotracheal tube, was used intermittently in each pig. Values (mean +/- SE) were compared using the mixed-effects model, accounting for animal-to-animal variability and repeated measurements. Result(s): Baseline RV and LV stroke volumes (ml) were 52.2 +/- 4.0 and 49.7 +/- 6.9, respectively, before VF. A total of 84 gasps were recorded during untreated VF in all animals: 56 without and 28 with an ITD. There were 11.7 +/- 1.0 gasps per pig starting 116.5 +/- 6.4 seconds after VF. Gasping intensity followed a crescendo/decrescendo pattern with an initial negative inspiratory phase and a positive expiratory phase. ITD use during gasping significantly decreased in airway pressure (-11.0 +/- 0.5 vs -1.8 +/- 0.5, p<0.01) versus no ITD. The intraventricular volumes and pressures (mmHg) generated during gasping increased significantly from no ITD to ITD use: RV volume 27.8 +/- 3.5 vs 41.4 +/- 3.8, p<0.01; RV pressure 14.7 +/- 2.2. vs 18.7 +/- 2.3, p<0.01, and LV volume 15.0 +/- 2.5 vs 19.6 +/- 2.8 p=0.053; LV pressure 19.3 +/- 3.2 vs 25.8 +/- 3.5, p<0.01. Conclusion(s): Gasping during untreated VF generated RV and LV volumes and pressures of ~ 55% and 27% of pre-VF diastolic values, respectively, while using an ITD increased generated RV and LV volumes and pressures to ~ 85% and 36% of pre-VF diastolic values, respectively. These findings demonstrate the mechanism by which gasping enhances circulation and the clinical importance of this fundamental auto-reflex.

Abstract
  The intracranial venous system (ICVS) represents in mammals a complex three-dimensional structure, which provides not only for adequate brain perfusion, but has also a significant impact on: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption, maintaining of the intracranial pressure (ICP), and brain thermoregulation. An intimate understanding of the anatomy and physiology of ICVS is fundamental for neurological diagnostics, selection of therapeutic options, and success of neurosurgical procedures in human and veterinary medicine. Since the intracranial interventions in dogs are recently performed more frequently than twenty or thirty years ago, the authors decided to review and report on the basic knowledge regarding the complex topic of morphology and function of the canine ICVS. The research strategy involved an NCBI/NLM, PubMed/MED-LINE, and Clarivate Analytics Web of Science search from January 1, 1960, to December 31, 2021, using the terms "canine dural venous sinuses"and "intracranial venous system in dogs"in the English language literature; also references from selected papers were scanned and relevant articles included.Copyright © 2022 I.

Abstract
  Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, also known as progeria, is a rare genetic disorder that causes premature and accelerated ageing from the neonatal period. The disease is caused by de novo mutations in the LMNA gene. Patients present with a range of symptoms, including skin, bone, joint and cardiac disorders, as well as characteristic facial dysmorphia. Intracranial hypertension is not a known symptom of this disease. To the best of our knowledge, no case of a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome presenting with intracranial hypertension without a traumatic context has been reported in the literature to date. This report presents the case of a child diagnosed with Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome who presented with intracranial hypertension at the age of three years, with no secondary cause identified. Long-term treatment with acetazolamide was required to control the intracranial hypertension. We hypothesise that the intracranial hypertension may be related to vascular abnormalities observed in Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, which may cause a venous drainage dysfunction. To support the hypothesis of a non-random association between intracranial hypertension and Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, further reports of similar cases in children with the syndrome are required.Copyright © 2025

Abstract
  Introduction Audiometric disturbances, such as tinnitus or hearing loss, are recognised complications after dura puncturing procedures. We report the case of a patient with severe bilateral tinnitus following lumbar puncture, who was treated with an epidural blood patch. The mechanism for tinnitus is unknown. It could result from a negative intracranial pressure caused by a cerebrospinal fluid leak during these procedures, which can cause an intra-labyrinthine pressure disturbance via the cochlear aqueduct. It could also result from the negative pressure causing traction on the vestibulocochlear nerve crossing the posterior cranial fossa, leading to a neurapraxia. A blood patch seeks to alleviate this negative pressure. Case report A 40-year-old lady presented with ongoing bilateral severe tinnitus and headache for 6 days after a lumbar puncture. She received a blood patch from the anaesthetic team. Management Eighteen millilitres of venous blood was injected into the epidural space. The patient scored 84 (grade 5) on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory before the blood patch; 3 hours postprocedure her score improved to 16 (grade 1), with complete resolution by 24 hours. Discussion Dr S Connor said that audiovestibular symptoms are not uncommon in patients with spontaneous hydrocephalus. Take home message One should enquire about epidural puncture procedures in patients presenting with tinnitus. An epidural blood patch can be considered in these cases.

Abstract
  Applying mechanical ventilation and selecting ventilatory strategies in patients with acute brain injuries, especially those with lung damage, is challenging. Static (positive-end-expiratory-pressure) and dynamic (intra-tidal) changes in ventilator pressure, via complex pathways, influence cerebral arterial inflow and cerebral venous pressure and thus, cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure. In this process, the relationship between airway pressure and pleural and trans-alveolar pressures, heavily affected by elastance of chest wall and lung, respectively, plays a central role. This relationship determines the extent to which a static and dynamic increase in airway pressure affect the cardiac function and venous return curves, which govern the static and dynamic arterial and central venous pressures. The integrity of cerebral autoregulation determines whether static changes in arterial pressure alter cerebral arterial inflow. Conversely, dynamic changes in arterial pressure during the breath are followed by corresponding changes in cerebral arterial inflow, due to inability of autoregulation to control rapid arterial pressure fluctuations. The flow dynamics in the jugular veins and the relationship between intracranial and sagittal sinus pressures determine whether static and dynamic changes in central venous pressure alter cerebral venous pressure. Setting the ventilator and planning strategies should be individualized and guided by the complex, interactive effects among central nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular systems on cerebral blood volume and cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressures. Following a logical framework, the clinician may anticipate the likely effects of ventilator settings and strategies on cerebral hemodynamics, enabling a more individualized approach in setting the ventilator and planning ventilatory strategies.

Abstract
  Low- or very-low-pressure hydrocephalus is a serious and rare phenomenon, which is becoming better known since it was first described in 1994 by Pang and Altschuler. Forced drainage at negative pressures can, in most cases, restore the ventricles to their original size, thus achieving neurological recovery. We present six new cases that suffered this syndrome from 2015 to 2020: two of them after medulloblastoma surgery; a third one as a consequence of a severe head trauma that required bifrontal craniectomy; another one after craniopharyngioma surgery; a fifth one with leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor; and, finally, a patient carrier a shunt for normotensive hydrocephalus diagnosed ten years before. At the moment of development, four of them had mid-low-pressure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts. Four patients required cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage at negative pressures oscillating from zero to -15 mmHg by external ventricular drainage until ventricular size normalized, followed by the placement of a new definitive low-pressure shunt, one of them to the right atrium. The duration of drainage in negative pressures through external ventricular drainage (EVD) ranged from 10 to 40 days with concomitant intracranial pressure monitoring at the neurointensive care unit. Approximately 200 cases of this syndrome have been described in the literature. The causes are varied and superimposable to those of high-pressure hydrocephalus. Neurological impairment is due to ventricular size and not to pressure values. Subzero drainage is still the most commonly used method, but other treatments have been described, such as neck wrapping, ventriculostomy of the third ventricle, and lumbar blood patches when associated with lumbar puncture. Its pathophysiology is not clear, although it seems to involve changes in the permeability and viscoelasticity of the brain parenchyma together with an imbalance in CSF circulation in the craniospinal subarachnoid space.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

Abstract
  Background: The pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic surgeries elevates intracranial ICP because of the increased abdominal pressure, and ICP increases even further in the Trendelenburg position. A new noninvasive method to measure optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) via ultrasonography detects the raised ICP is reliable and inexpensive and can be repeated many times. Method(s): In this prospective observational study, 23 pediatric patients aged between 5 and 16 years, undergoing elective laparoscopic procedures under general anesthesia, were included. After endotracheal intubation with proper aseptic precautions, ocular ultrasound was performed to measure baseline ONSD in both eyes. Later, pneumoperitoneum was established by maintaining the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) at 12 cmH2O. Again, ONSD was estimated at 15 minutes of pneumoperitoneum and observed for any variation from the previous readings. The cutoff considered for ONSD was 5 mm, above which the intracranial pressure (ICP) was regarded as increased. Result(s): In our study, the mean age of subjects was 9.67 +/- 5.18 years. The majority were males (60.9%). The subjects showed an increase in ONSD at the 15th minute after inducing pneumoperitoneum using abdominal CO2 insufflation, in comparison with the baseline values, in the left eye [4.67 +/- 0.48, P 0.016] and the right eye [4.63 +/- 0.43]. The readings of ONSD were observed to be <5 mm, not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): USG-guided ONSD measurements serve as a valuable tool in ensuring optimal intra-abdominal pressures and safe administration of anesthesia for patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, particularly those vulnerable to an increase in ICP.Copyright © 2025 Saudi Journal of Anesthesia.

Abstract
  Background: Though lumbar puncture is contraindicated in raised intracranial pressure, it is performed in a controlled manner to diagnose idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).[1,2] We describe a case of spinal anaesthesia administered in a patient with IIH. Case Report: A 29-year-old primigravida, with 37 weeks of gestational age and a history of hypothyroidism and gestational diabetes, came with left orbital pain for five days. After consulting an ophthalmologist and neurologist, she was diagnosed with left abducens nerve palsy. After ruling out common causes, suspecting IIH, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) manometry was advised before lower segment Caesarean section. A central venous pressure manometer measured CSF pressure, followed by a subarachnoid block through the same puncture. CSF pressures were on the higher side. Intraoperatively, the patient was stable, and a healthy baby was delivered. Oral diamox 250 mg was given to the patient preand postoperatively, and she recovered completely in 1 month. Conclusion(s): Spinal anaesthesia can be safely administered in raised intracranial pressures.

Abstract
  Background and Aims: Craniosynostosis, premature fusion of skull sutures, results in an abnormally shaped head. Presentations include raised intracranial pressure (ICP) due to hydrocephalus, craniocerebral disproportion, and abnormal cerebral venous drainage.[1,2] This study was undertaken to analyse challenges associated with the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia for corrective repair. Method(s): This retrospective case series study was performed to observe the constructive repair for craniosynostosis over six years. Data was collected after getting institutional ethics committee approval and informed written consent. Preoperative anaesthesia assessment, including clinical evaluation and laboratory investigations, was noted. Intraoperative mode of anaesthesia and haemodynamic monitoring documented in the case sheets were recorded. Details about the postoperative follow-up in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the postoperative ward were also recorded. All these data were analysed. Result(s): A total of 10 cases were analysed in this study. Two children required cranial vault reconstruction, and eight children underwent cranioplasty. The raised ICP was not seen. All cases were taken in endotracheal general anaesthesia (ETGA). Difficult airways were seen in two patients, managed by proper positioning and inhalational induction of anaesthesia. The mean duration of surgery was 5 h 15 min. None required postoperative ventilatory support. Blood transfusion was needed in children who underwent cranial vault reconstruction. Intraoperative haemodynamic changes were minimal and managed with crystalloids. Conclusion(s): Craniosynostosis requires a neurological intervention and a prolonged duration of general anaesthesia. The primary anticipated complications were managed by efficient preoperative assessment, intraoperative monitoring and fluid management.

Abstract
  It is generally accepted that intraocular pressure (IOP) depends on the rate of aqueous humor production, system outflow resistance, and episcleral venous pressure. Therefore, control IOP values are expected to be within the strict and predictable limits in specific animal species, and there should be no vast differences between species. However, in the literature the control IOP values significantly vary (from potentially "hypotensive" to "hypertensive") within the same species, and especially between species depending on the measurement technique, head position in relation to the rest of the body, circadian rhythm, age, and topical and systemic drugs (anesthetics) applied. These variations make it difficult to compare different therapeutic approaches for intraocular hypertension, investigate the correlation between IOP and intracranial pressure, and determine target IOP values in glaucoma research. We recommend that different IOP physiology and pathophysiology studies take into account all the mentioned factors when describing IOP measurement methodology.Copyright © 2024, Medicinska Naklada Zagreb.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is an uncommon sequela of low intracranial pressure, which may result from a lumbar puncture (LP). We describe a case of a patient in their 40s presenting with 48 hours of persistent headache following intrathecal administration of nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3. There were no focal neurological signs or symptoms apart from baseline symmetrical proximal limb weakness attributed to SMA. Initial investigations revealed radiological evidence of an acute cerebral venous sinus thrombus (CVST). The patient was promptly started on anticoagulation. Partial recanalisation was seen as soon as 48 hours after commencement of anticoagulation, with almost full resolution of the thrombus at follow-up in 2 months. Awareness of CVST as a potential complication of intrathecal therapies and diagnostic LP allows for early identification, management and prevention of serious neurological consequences.Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2025.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare cerebrovascular condition that causes obstruction of venous blood flow or cerebrospinal fluid circulation, leading to intracranial hypertension symptoms such as syncope and vomiting. Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) syndrome, a complication of hysteroscopic surgery, can also present with cerebral edema and symptoms similar to CVST, making differentiation challenging. Cases of unexplained recurrent syncope posthysteroscopy diagnosed as CVST have not been previously reported. We present a case of a 33-year-old woman who underwent hysteroscopy for abnormal uterine bleeding. Five hours postoperation, she experienced syncope, which resolved spontaneously. Ten hours later, she had recurrent syncope, nausea, and vomiting. Head computed tomography suggested cerebral edema, potentially indicating TURP syndrome. However, the brief surgery and minimal fluid imbalance (200 mL) made TURP syndrome unlikely. Further investigation with cranial magnetic resonance venography revealed multiple venous sinus thromboses, explaining the recurrent syncope linked to minimal fluid volume expansion postsurgery. Subsequent screening identified hyperhomocysteinemia as a contributing factor. Treatment with anticoagulants, folic acid, and vitamin B6 led to a favorable outcome. This case involves recurrent syncope after hysteroscopy secondary to CVST. If symptoms such as recurrent syncope, nausea, and vomiting, indicating increased intracranial pressure, arise posthysteroscopy and cannot be attributed to typical TURP syndrome, primary intracranial vascular conditions like CVST should be considered, as even a minor increase in blood volume can exacerbate these intracranial pressure symptoms.Copyright © 2025 The Authors

Abstract
  Acute Liver Failure (ALF) is associated with rapidly progressive multiorgan failure and may even lead to death. Although liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as the only viable treatment option, there are many challenges associated with LT. The literature available from developed countries mainly focuses on the prognosis of ALF with limited focus on the anaesthetic management of LT. In the developing world particularly, the facility and experience of LT is relatively new. This case report presents the first case from Pakistan regarding the anaesthesia management of ALF. It discusses the management of a 46-year-old female who underwent emergency LT which includes initiation of Total Intravenous Anaesthesia, steps to reduce intra-cranial pressure, continuous Renal Replacement Therapy, and correction of coagulopathy using thromboelastography. To conclude, a holistic understanding of pre, intra, and post-operative anaesthetic management of liver transplantation requires a multidisciplinary team management and can significantly improve the survival rates.Copyright © 2025 Pakistan Medical Association.

Abstract
  Background and Aim: Thrombosis of the cerebral venous system presents commonly with headache (~80%) and seizures (45%). Case Report: We present a case of a 17-year-old female who presented with unusual symptomatology following cortical venous thrombosis. Discussion(s): A 17-year-old female patient presented with a past history of a neurological syndrome of double vision and bilateral subacute vision loss with partial recovery 3 years ago. She now presented with further worsening of vision bilaterally with malaligned eyes over 1 week, followed by motor weakness involving the bilateral upper and lower limbs progressed over 3-4 days, without history of headache/ vomiting or other positive history. Examination revealed bilaterally absent perception of light, bilateral disc pallor on fundoscopic examination, complete ophthalmoplegia with generalized hypotonia, proximal more than distal weakness of bilateral upper and lower limbs, truncal and neck muscles weakness with areflexia without other positive findings. MRI brain and spine revealed no detectable abnormal findings. MRV revealed features suggestive of cerebral venous thrombosis involving the superior sagittal sinus, straight sinus, and right transverse sinus. Nerve conduction studies revealed features of diffuse radiculopathy. Lumbar puncture showed elevated CSF opening pressure of more than 50 cm of H2O with an otherwise normal CSF analysis report. Conclusion(s): We report a case of IIH presented with an uncommon syndrome of a rapid diminution of visual acuity, ophthalmoplegia, and flaccid limb weakness due to extensive radiculopathy secondary to elevated ICP. Quadriparesis is a rare presentation of raised intracranial pressure, which may delay the diagnosis and affect the outcome.

Abstract
  Aims = Objectives: In an effort to improve resuscitation in pediatric cardiac arrest, sustained lung inflation (SI) during CPR is an innovative technique in which prolonged positive intrathoracic pressure (ITP) is maintained, driving blood flow to extrathoracic organs. SI improves hemodynamics and time to ROSC when compared with standard ventilation (SV). However, increased ITP may increase intracranial pressure (ICP), compromising cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and blood flow (CBF). Here, we compared CPP (MAP-ICP) and CBF in piglets ventilated with SI versus Standard Ventilation (SV). We hypothesized that an increase in ICP with SI will be offset by an increase in MAP, and that CBF in the SI group will not be inferior to CBF in the SV group. Method(s): In this ongoing preclinical, randomized, non-inferiority trial, anesthetized piglets underwent 7 minutes of asphyxia followed by fibrillation. CPR is initiated with 8 minutes of BLS followed by 8 minutes of ALS. The SV group (n=6) followed AHA ventilation guidelines, whereas the SI group (n=6) received 20 cmH20 inflating pressure. CBF was measured with microspheres at baseline, and at 3 (BLS) and 13 minutes (ALS) of CPR. Result(s): Mean [+/-SE] CBF in control and SI groups were similar at baseline (84[+/-18] vs.104[+/-21]), during BLS (18[+/-11] vs. 18[+/-6]), and during ALS (9[+/-8] vs. 7[+/-2]). Likewise, mean [+/-SE] CPP was similar at baseline (87[+/-7] vs. 86[+/-5]), during BLS (18[+/-8] vs. 19[+/-3]), and during ALS (15[+/-4] vs. 19[+/-6]). Conclusion(s): On interim analysis, SI and SV were similar in maintaining CPP and CBF during CPR.

Abstract
  Introduction: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prone positioning can improve gas exchange by promoting uniform lung aeration. However, elevated ventilation pressures may increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and disrupt cerebral autoregulation. This study investigated the effects of PEEP on ICP and cerebral autoregulation in a porcine model with healthy lungs and normal ICP, comparing prone and supine positions. Cerebral autoregulation was assessed through cerebrovascular reactivity using the pressure reactivity index (PRx). We also explored whether other baseline variables influenced potential variances in ICP and PRx. Methodology: Twelve anesthetized pigs were randomized to begin in either supine or prone position, across PEEP of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cmH2O. Continuous monitoring included esophageal pressure to calculate end-inspiratory and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressures. The ICM+ software (University of Cambridge Enterprise, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used for high-resolution data collection, signal processing and ICP curve analysis. Linear mixed-effects models and ANOVA were used to analyze changes in ICP and PRx and the influence of position. An exploratory correlation analysis was conducted on baseline variables potentially related to the ICP increase. Result(s): Mean ICP increase was 1.0mmHg+/-0.9 at 10 cmH2O PEEP, 2.0mmHg+/-1.7 at 15 cmH2O PEEP, and 3.1mmHg+/-1.6 at 20 cmH2O PEEP compared to a baseline PEEP of 5 cmH2O (p<0.001). The effect of PEEP increase on ICP was not influenced by body position. PRx remained unaffected by PEEP. PEEP-induced increases in ICP were higher in cases of higher baseline ICP, higher central venous pressure, lower respiratory system elastance and lower end-inspiratory and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressures. Conclusion(s): Increasing PEEP elevates ICP regardless of body position without adversely affecting cerebral autoregulation in a healthy porcine model. Baseline ICP, central venous pressure, respiratory system elastance and end-inspiratory and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure may influence the magnitude of ICP changes.Copyright © 2025 Hammervold, Beqiri, Smielewski, Storm, Nielsen, Guerin and Frisvold.

Abstract
  Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Decompressive craniectomy is a common life-saving intervention in the setting of elevated intracranial pressure. Cranioplasty restores the calvarium and intracranial physiology once swelling recedes. Cranioplasty is often thought of as a low-risk intervention. However, numerous reports indicate that malignant cerebral edema (MCE) is an often-fatal complication of an otherwise uneventful cranioplasty. A careful review of the literature is needed to better understand this devastating condition. Case Report: A 41-year-old man presented after suffering a gunshot wound to the right frontal lobe. Upon initial evaluation, the patient had grossly visible brain matter, left-sided hemiparesis with a Glascow Coma Score (GCS) of 11, and vital signs concerning for elevated intracranial pressure. Computed tomography (CT) showed right-sided intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage with a 5 mm leftward midline shift. The patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for right fronto-parietal craniectomy. Over the next 3 months, he recovered steadily and underwent PEEK cranioplasty on post-operative day 83. Pre-operative CT showed sunken skin flap syndrome with an 8-mm midline shift. Following an uneventful cranioplasty, he failed to regain consciousness. Examination revealed absent brainstem reflexes. CT showed global diffuse cerebral edema. The patient was declared brain dead. Conclusion(s): Continued research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of malignant cerebral edema so that future incidences may be prevented. A combination of negative-pressure suction drainage, sunken skin flap syndrome, and delayed time to cranioplasty likely play a significant role in the evolution of MCE. We urge neurosurgeons to consider the likelihood of MCE and adapt surgical planning accordingly.Copyright © Am J Case Rep.

Abstract
  Introduction: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare but serious condition in both adults and children. Risk factors include thrombophilias, dehydration, and certain inherited conditions like sickle cell trait (SCT). We present a case of CVST in a pediatric patient with SCT to highlight key considerations in diagnosis and management. Case Presentation: A 14-year-old male with SCT presented with worsening headache and vomiting after prolonged sun exposure and dehydration during athletic camp. Imaging revealed right occipital hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, right CSVT, and bilateral cerebellar developmental venous anomalies. Hypercoagulability testing was normal. Diagnostic evaluation included computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, MR venography (MRV), and hypercoagulability testing. The patient was treated with an external ventricular drain, platelet transfusion, and anticoagulation. Management also involved hydration, platelet transfusion, supportive care, and multidisciplinary follow-up. Follow-up MRV showed recanalization. Conclusion(s): This case highlights SCT as a potential CVST risk factor. Timely recognition, evaluation of precipitants like dehydration, supportive care including anticoagulation, and multidisciplinary management are important. An individualized approach is needed to balance thrombosis recurrence and bleeding risks. Patients with SCT require education on risks and prompt evaluation of neurological symptoms to allow early diagnosis and care of CVST.Copyright © 2024 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Abstract
  Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) is associated with significantly increased mortality and morbidity. The mechanisms underlying AKI in these patients are complex and multifactorial and different from those seen in patients with chronic liver disease. Proposed mechanisms include systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), bile cast nephropathy, congestive nephropathy, decreased renal perfusion due to elevated intra-abdominal pressure, overaggressive decongestant therapy for hepatic encephalopathy-related raised intracranial pressure, and direct nephrotoxic effects. Despite these proposed mechanisms, the literature remains sparse on the diverse causes of AKI in ALF and the strategies to mitigate its effects. Therefore, this systematic review aims to estimate the prevalence of AKI among ALF patients, identify risk factors for AKI in this population, evaluate its impact on patient outcomes, and highlight critical gaps in the existing research. Method(s): We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar using the search term "acute kidney injury in acute liver failure" between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2024. Studies reporting epidemiological data on AKI in adult ALF patients and written in English were included. Studies focusing on AKI in acute-on-chronic liver failure or cirrhosis were excluded. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using a five-point questionnaire, and studies were rated as high, moderate, or low quality based on the scores achieved. Results were synthesized in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (Figure 1). [Formula presented] Results: Nine studies (eight retrospective and one prospective), with a total of 6,028 participants were included in the analysis (seeFigure 2). [Formula presented] Of these, 3,795 patients (62.9%) were diagnosed with AKI (Figure 3). The studies comprised six single-centre studies, two registries, and one multicentre study. Five studies were rated as high quality, while four were of moderate quality. Eight studies included both acetaminophen- and non-acetaminophen-related ALF, with one study focusing solely on acetaminophen-induced ALF (Figure 4). Other reported etiologies of ALF included autoimmune disorders, viral hepatitis, and others (Figure 5). [Formula presented] [Formula presented] The mean age of the study populations was 41.86 +/- 4.3 years, with 67% female participants (range: 45.4% to 76.1%). Three studies identified independent risk factors for AKI in ALF patients (Figure 6). [Formula presented] Two studies differentiated between transient AKI (defined as complete renal recovery within 48 hours of onset) and persistent AKI (renal injury persisting beyond 48 hours). In one study, transient AKI occurred in 29.4% of patients, while persistent AKI was observed in 70.5%. Another study reported 9.6% transient AKI and 80.7% persistent AKI. These studies emphasized that persistent AKI, as opposed to transient AKI, is associated with higher mortality and worse outcomes. Figures 7, 8, and 9 present the outcome results of different studies, showing poorer transplant-free survival rates among patients with AKI compared to those without AKI. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Our study highlights the significant burden of AKI in ALF patients, as well as the variation in AKI outcomes. However, our findings are limited by the lack of data on the specific causes and risk factors for AKI in ALF. The reporting methods in the included studies were heterogeneous, making comparisons difficult. Furthermore, most of the available data originate from Europe and the USA, leaving many regions underrepresented. The causes and risk factors for AKI in ALF may differ substantially in these underrepresented regions, requiring further investigation. Conclusion(s): More than half of patients with acute liver failure (ALF) experience acute kidney injury (AKI), many cases of which may be preventable. Addressing these underlying causes has the potential to significantly reduce the high mortality rates occurring in patients of ALF with AKI. This review emphasizes the urgent need for collaboration between nephrologists and hepatologists to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms, risk factors, and outcomes of AKI in ALF patients. Future research should focus on identifying modifiable risk factors, developing effective prevention and mitigation strategies, and expanding studies to include more geographically diverse populations.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE The exact association between the frequently present anomalous intracranial venous vasculature, emissary collaterals, ventriculomegaly, and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in children with Apert and Crouzon syndromes remains an enigma. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the aberrant venous system and ventricle size and increased ICP, and to assess the development of the venous structures over time. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included all patients with Apert or Crouzon syndrome with available CT venography (CTV) scans of the brain. Anomalous venous vasculature was assessed by the total collateral score (TCS), which scored 9 intra- and extracranial venous structures (TCS range 0-16). Ventricle size (fronto-occipital horn ratio [FOHR]) was measured on the same scan. The presence of increased ICP, a shunt, tonsillar herniation, and head circumference were extracted from electronic patient records and were used as secondary covariates. Subsequent CTV scans were scored when available. RESULTS Ninety patients were included in this study. The mean TCS was 7.5 +/- 2.5, and was comparable for patients with Apert and Crouzon syndromes (mean 8.0 and 7.3, respectively). The presence of an extra abnormal venous structure was associated with an increase of the FOHR of 3.2% (p < 0.01). After dividing the venous structures into intra- and extracranial, a similar association between both and the FOHR was found (4.1% and 2.3%, respectively; p < 0.01). The TCS was similar for patients with normal and increased ICP at the time of the scan. Sixteen patients had dual CTV scans. The median time between both scans was 3.2 years. The presence of collaterals remained stable over time (median DELTATCS = 0.3). Seven patients with functioning shunts also maintained high TCSs (median TCS = 9). CONCLUSIONS In patients with Apert and Crouzon syndromes, a close relationship between venous collaterals and ventricle size was observed, in which a more extensive aberrant venous drainage pattern, both intra- and extracranial, was associated with larger ventricles. Preliminary longitudinal data suggested that the presence of venous collaterals remained constant over time despite effective treatment of increased ICP, indicating reliance on these collaterals even in cases of normal ICP. The authors hypothesize that this dependence on collateral drainage is the result of their aberrant internal venous anatomy and predisposes individuals to increased ICP.Copyright © 2025 American Association of Neurological Surgeons.

Abstract
  Skeletal muscle relaxants have their place in everyday use in numerous anesthesiological procedures, such as preparing a patient for surgery, supporting mechanical ventilation, and performing effective intubation. These drugs can be divided, based on their mechanism of action, into depolarizing skeletal relaxants, such as succinylcholine, and non-depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants. Non-depolarizing agents are further categorized, based on their structure, into steroidal (eg, rocuronium) and benzylisoquinoline (eg, atracurium) compounds. To gain better control over neuromuscular blockade and patient recovery, a group of drugs known as reversal agents was developed. The effectiveness of skeletal muscle relaxants can be influenced by factors such as acid-base imbalances, impaired metabolism, and excretion, due to kidney or liver dysfunction, age, and sex. Skeletal muscle relaxants have also been used in neurosurgical procedures. It is believed that these drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier. By reducing intrathoracic pressure and central venous pressure, they can lower intracranial pressure. However, in some studies, an increase in intracranial pressure has been observed. Therefore, selecting the appropriate drug is crucial, particularly for patients with suspected or confirmed elevated intracranial pressure, which is defined as the pressure within the intracranial space relative to atmospheric pressure. Elevated intracranial pressure above normal levels can occur in various conditions, such as sinus thrombosis, aneurysm rupture, brain tumors, intraventricular hemorrhage, and meningitis. In this article, we aim to review the role of muscle relaxants and reversal agents in neurosurgical procedures.Copyright © Med Sci Monit, 2024.

Abstract
  Background Venous sinus stenting (VSS) has been shown to reduce intracranial venous pressures and improve symptoms in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). However, long-term follow-up data are limited, raising concerns about sustained symptom improvement. We aimed to assess long-term outcomes of VSS compared with ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS). Methods A retrospective case-control study assessed 87 patients with IIH who met inclusion criteria and underwent either VSS (n=27) or VPS (n=60) between 2017 and 2022. Descriptive statistics for baseline characteristics and outcomes were calculated, followed by multivariate logistic regression to identify factors associated with headache recurrence. Results Baseline characteristics were similar between VSS and VPS groups, including age (p=0.58), sex (p=0.74), body mass index (p=0.47), and preoperative lumbar puncture opening pressure (p=0.62). Preoperative symptoms of headaches (p=0.42), papilledema (p=0.35), and pulsatile tinnitus (p=0.56) were also similar. Initial headache improvement was comparable (96% vs 91%, p=0.42). However, headache recurrence was less common in the VSS group (31% vs 60%, p=0.015) at the last follow-up, averaging over 1 year. Multivariate analysis showed VSS was independently associated with reduced odds of headache recurrence (OR 0.24, p=0.015). Longer follow-up was associated with increased odds of headache recurrence in both groups (OR 1.01, p=0.032). Conclusion VSS was independently associated with reduced odds of headache recurrence compared with VPS in multivariate analysis. Longer follow-up was significantly associated with headache recurrence in both groups. This suggests that VSS may lead to better outcomes for continued headache relief, but headache recurrence may increase with longer follow-up regardless of treatment modality.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

Abstract
  Despite the well documented increased risk of thrombosis in patients with cancer and during chemotherapy, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) remains a rare entity. We present a rare case of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhoea secondary to a left transverse sinus thrombus which occurred 2 years previously during chemotherapy for breast cancer. The patient underwent a three-layer repair using Neuro-Patch, septal cartilage and middle turbinate pedicle flap and was started on acetazolamide. There was no recurrence at 1-year follow-up. Raised intracranial pressure secondary to cerebral venous occlusion can erode the base of skull and predispose to CSF leaks. Despite the theoretical risk, there have been no cases reported where CSF leaks have occurred following chemotherapy induced CVT. We describe the first case and discuss pathophysiology and management.Copyright © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Background: Growing evidence suggests that for rodents, a substantial fraction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drains by crossing the cribriform plate into the nasopharyngeal lymphatics, eventually reaching the cervical lymphatic vessels (CLVs). Disruption of this drainage pathway is associated with various neurological disorders. Method(s): We employ a lumped parameter method to numerically model CSF drainage across the cribriform plate to CLVs. Our model uses intracranial pressure as an inlet pressure and central venous blood pressure as an outlet pressure. The model incorporates initial lymphatic vessels (modeling those in the nasal region) that absorb the CSF and collecting lymphatic vessels (modeling CLVs) to transport the CSF against an adverse pressure gradient. To determine unknown parameters such as wall stiffness and valve properties, we utilize a Monte Carlo approach and validate our simulation against recent in vivo experimental measurements. Result(s): Our parameter analysis reveals the physical characteristics of CLVs. Our results suggest that the stiffness of the vessel wall and the closing state of the valve are crucial for maintaining the vessel size and volume flow rate observed in vivo. We find that a decreased contraction amplitude and frequency leads to a reduction in volume flow rate, and we test the effects of varying the different pressures acting on the CLVs. Finally, we provide evidence that branching of initial lymphatic vessels may deviate from Murray's law to reduce sensitivity to elevated intracranial pressure. Conclusion(s): This is the first numerical study of CSF drainage through CLVs. Our comprehensive parameter analysis offers guidance for future numerical modeling of CLVs. This study also provides a foundation for understanding physiology of CSF drainage, helping guide future experimental studies aimed at identifying causal mechanisms of reduction in CLV transport and potential therapeutic approaches to enhance flow.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Second stage of labor is considered to be associated with an increased risk of intrapartum fetal hypoxic injury. This is due to a combination of several risk factors such as -the increased frequency, strength and duration of uterine contractions due to higher number and affinity of myometrial oxytocin receptors; -the Ferguson's reflex which leads to a reflex release of endogenous oxytocin in response of the distension of the cervix by descending fetal head in late stages of labor; maternal expulsive efforts with the Valsalva manoeuvre that may reduce maternal oxygenation, as well as reduce the venous return and maternal cardiac output due to increased intrathoracic pressure, winch may lead to reduced placental oxygenation; - and increased fetal intracranial pressure due to head compression leading to a potential decrease in fetal cerebral oxygenation. In addition, the umbilical cord often forms one or more loops around the fetal neck, which may get tightened as the head descends leading to an acute and intermittent cessation of fetal oxygenation. Operative interventions during the second stage of labor such as vacuum, forceps or emergency caesarean section may increase the risk of maternal and fetal trauma. Therefore, an accurate interpretation of the fetal heart rate changes by applying the knowledge of fetal pathophysiology is essential: to timely recognise the onset of fetal decompensation preventing intrapartum hypoxic-ischaemic brain injuries; to avoid erroneous monitoring of the maternal heart rate as fetal heart rate; and to abstain from unnecessary operative interventions due to misinterpretation of the significance of the observed fetal heart rate changes.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  Removal of the internal jugular vein (IJV) in unilateral radical neck dissection (rND) necessitates redirection of cerebrovenous blood to collateral pathways. If adaptation is insufficient, neurologic sequelae develop that are due to impaired venous drainage and increased intracranial pressure. The authors studied venous hemodynamic effects of unilateral rND using Doppler and duplex ultrasound in 17 patients. Blood flow velocities (BFVs) were recorded from the distal IJV (dIJV) and the vertebral vein (VV) before and 9 to 88 days after surgery. A preoperative compression test of the dIJV was performed to identify the side of dominant drainage. The BFV increased in the contralateral dIJV after right-sided rND (n = 10) by 111% (range, 50% to 320%), and after left-sided rND (n = 7) by 34% (range, 5% to 105%). In the contralateral VV, a rise of BFV by 75% was found. Our results confirm the role of the contralateral dIJV as the predominant collateral pathway. The VVs serve as an important additional major outflow. Doppler ultrasound may help to identify patients at risk of insufficient cerebrovenous drainage after rND.

Abstract
  Laparoscopy, as the most frequently chosen surgical technique in the world, carries specific complications and distinctions in anesthetic management. Complications of laparoscopy, particularly perceptible as disorders of the physiology of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems, are caused by the specific technical conditions required for this type of operation. To facilitate surgical access and to clarify the surgical field, it is necessary to create a splenic emphysema, consisting of filling the peritoneal cavity with carbon dioxide (CO2). This results in an increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and increased diffusion of CO2 into the blood, causing a state of hypercarbia. The impact of these disturbances is of great importance in the pathological functioning of the above-mentioned organ systems. The anesthetist, in addition to the need to induce a state of general anesthesia, must be aware of and understand the pathological impact of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and hypercarbia to adjust patient monitoring accordingly and implement appropriate treatment targeting the specific complications occurring during laparoscopy. Complications and contraindications important from the anesthetist's point of view are also described. The 51 articles and reference texts were used for this purpose, which, combined with the authors' knowledge and experience, is intended to be a valuable resource for use by anesthesiology staff.

Abstract
  Haematological disorders can present in the setting of acute and chronic neurological symptomatology through a myriad mechanisms. They may affect the vascularity by generating a hyperviscous and prothrombotic state leading to stroke like events- arterial or venous. Bleeds can also be a part of the spectrum due to platelet dysfunction or altered coagulation status. Cranial nerves, optic nerve in particular may be affected due to raised intracranial pressure (ICP), venous congestion or due to direct infiltration in haematological malignancies. Tumoriform lesions formed of leukemia cells acting like Space Occupying Lesions (SOLs) and bone destroying lesions generating pressure effects on brain or cord. Peripheral nervous system may be affected by antibody mediated nerve injury leading to a variety of neuropathies. In this review article we wish to have an insight into such manifestations with real life case scenarios to support them.Copyright © 2023 International Medical Sciences Academy. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Background: Patients with brain damage often require mechanical ventilation. Although lung-protective ventilation is recommended, the application of increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to altered cerebral venous return. This study investigates the effects of flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) using negative end-expiratory pressures (NEEP), on cerebral hemodynamics in a swine model of intracranial hypertension. Method(s): A model of intracranial hypertension involving bilateral trepan bolt holes was performed in 14 pigs. Pressure-controlled volume-guaranteed ventilation (PCV-VG) with PEEP and FCV using PEEP and then NEEP were applied. Intracranial pressure and oxygenation, as well as systemic hemodynamics and gas exchange parameters, were continuously monitored. Data were collected at baseline and at varying PEEP levels for both PCV-VG and FCV ventilation modalities. Following this, FCV ventilation and NEEP levels of -3, -6 and -9 cmH2O were applied. Result(s): ICP remained stable with low PEEP levels, but significantly decreased with NEEP. Lower ICP following NEEP improved cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral tissue oxygenation (p < 0.05 for all). FCV with NEEP at EEP-6 and EEP-9 significantly improved cardiac output and mean arterial pressure (MAP), compared to PCV-VG and FCV using PEEP (p < 0.05, respectively). There were no significant differences in gas exchange parameters between modalities (PCV-VG vs FCV), and between the application of PEEP or NEEP. No significant correlations were observed between DELTAICP and DELTAMAP. Conclusion(s): The application of FCV with NEEP appears to be a safe ventilation mode and offers an additional tool for controlling severe intracranial pressure episodes. These findings warrant validation in future studies and may lead to important potential applications in clinical practice.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Deranged cerebral autoregulation (CA) is associated with worse outcome in adult brain injury. Strategies for monitoring CA and maintaining the brain at its 'best CA status' have been implemented, however, this approach has not yet developed for the paediatric population. This scoping review aims to find up-to-date evidence on CA assessment in children and neonates with a view to identify patient categories in which CA has been measured so far, CA monitoring methods and its relationship with clinical outcome if any. A literature search was conducted for studies published within 31st December 2022 in 3 bibliographic databases. Out of 494 papers screened, this review includes 135 studies. Our literature search reveals evidence for CA measurement in the paediatric population across different diagnostic categories and age groups. The techniques adopted, indices and thresholds used to assess and define CA are heterogeneous. We discuss the relevance of available evidence for CA assessment in the paediatric population. However, due to small number of studies and heterogeneity of methods used, there is no conclusive evidence to support universal adoption of CA monitoring, technique, and methodology. This calls for further work to understand the clinical impact of CA monitoring in paediatric and neonatal intensive care.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Objective: Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Establishing TBI guidelines is crucial for prehospital management. Civilian medical practices are often influenced by military trauma guidelines. This study provides a comparative analysis of prehospital TBI management by a civilian air medical evacuation service using civilian guidelines and military clinical practice guidelines from the Joint Trauma System of the Department of Defense. Method(s): A retrospective review of 100 deidentified patient transport logs from a prominent civilian air medical service was conducted. The logs were compared with the service's patient care guidelines and the 2023 Joint Trauma System Clinical Practice Guidelines. Data were analyzed for adherence to 14 metrics. Result(s): Patients showed improvement in preflight and postflight Glasgow Coma Scale scores and were managed according to recommendations on head elevation, oxygenation, blood pressure, and temperature by both organizations. Discrepancies between guidelines included differences in the management of ventilator settings, blood pressure, oxygenation, temperature, serum glucose, intracranial hypertension, suspected brain herniation, serum sodium levels, and seizure prophylaxis. Conclusion(s): Comparing civilian and military guidelines highlights areas for potential improvements in TBI management, such as integrating advanced monitoring and the implementation of (i-STAT, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) testing in air transport to enhance patient care and outcomes.Copyright © 2024 The Authors

Abstract
  We describe the case of a 72-year-old man who presented with signs of increased intracranial pressure, right-sided motor deficit, and repeated episodes of epilepsy due to a left frontal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a large superficial draining vein. Despite great efforts to protect the vein from the start, it ruptured shortly after we removed the bone flap. This required rigorous hemorrhage control, which in turn led to profuse bleeding from the nidus throughout the process of the dissection and coagulation of the arterial feeders. The postoperative course was initially uneventful; however, the patient declined neurologically and became unresponsive on the second day after surgery. Emergent CT revealed a significant hematoma occupying the space where the AVM nidus had been resected. The patient was taken back to the OR for emergency evacuation of the hematoma. Despite these efforts, the neurological status remained poor, and the patient was transferred to a territorial hospital after spending 3 weeks in the ICU. An early rupture of the venous drainage represents a dreaded complication of AVM surgery, which can compromise the intervention before the start of the definite resection. We discuss our experience of and strategy for preventing and managing the intraoperative venous rupture of AVMs by describing our seven rules of "Don't." We also provide a brief overview of the relevant literature.Copyright © The Author(s) 2025.

Abstract
  Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a complex multifaceted neurosurgical emergency with cardiopulmonary complications. Concurrent atrial fibrillation seen commonly in the geriatric population further challenges perioperative management. Osmotherapeutic agents such as mannitol are routinely used in SAH to decrease intracranial pressure by withdrawing water from the brain parenchyma into the intravascular space. However, mannitol also has the potential to cause myocardial dysfunction and exacerbation of arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation in geriatric patients with decreased cardiovascular reserve. The literature on goal-directed fluid therapy and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided intraoperative management of a case of atrial fibrillation is sparse. This case report highlights the role of mannitol in the potentiation of arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation which was then successfully managed using goal-directed fluid therapy and TEE leading to a favorable outcome.Copyright © 2024 AANA Publishing Inc..

Abstract
  Background: Endovascular treatment of dural venous sinus stenosis using auto-expandable stents is progressively becoming a central part in the management of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and pulsatile tinnitus. One potential concern during stenting is impairment of venous outflow in the Labbe vein, which usually drains in close proximity to the culprit transverse sinus stenosis. Method(s): We propose a technique which can counteract venous outflow impairment, consisting of temporary balloon protection of the Labbe vein during stent deployment. Result(s): We illustrate the use of this technique in a case of IIH with intrinsic dural sinus stenosis induced by a large arachnoid granulation situated close to the insertion of the Labbe vein. The stent was deployed under temporary balloon inflation in order to deflect the arachnoid granulation away from the vein ostium. Conclusion(s): In selected cases of intrinsic stenosis, temporary balloon protection can be used to avoid Labbe vein flow impairment during venous sinus stenting.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Objective: Endoscopic management of pediatric hydrocephalus is always challenging because of the different anatomical structure of the ventricles. The aim of this study is to document the endoscopic anatomy of the ventricular system and to show the variations and deformations. Method(s): The study included 84 children who underwent endoscopic surgery for the treatment of hydrocephalus in the department of neurosurgery between 2017 and 2022. All preoperative and postoperative radiological images and intraoperative video recordings were retrospectively analyzed. Anatomy of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle, variations, and deformations were detected and evaluated in detail. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 7.6 months. Myelomeningocele-encephalocele-associated hydrocephalus was the most common cause of hydrocephalus (38%), followed by postventriculitis in 21%, posthemorrhagic in 21%, and obstructive causes in 20% of cases, respectively. Endoscopic anomaly/variation or deformation was detected in 83% of all cases. Based on the preoperative radiological images, septum pellucidum anomaly/variation or deformation was the most common radiological finding in 64% of the cases. Lateral ventricle anomaly/variation or deformation was noted in 62% of the cases, and third ventricle anomaly/variation or deformation was observed as a radiological finding in 27% of the cases. Conclusion(s): The compliance of the brain deteriorates with increasing intracranial pressure in pediatric hydrocephalus and the intraventricular anatomical structures differ from the normal anatomy. Developmental anomalies of the ventricle are also significant and since all these variations are often unpredictable on preoperative imaging, awareness of endoscopic anatomy, variations, and deformations will improve operative safety in children.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  Introduction Post-exercise arterial hypotension is a well described normal phenomenon in healthy humans. While the exact integrated pathways and mechanisms are not fully described, the drop in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) minutes to hours following exercise, results from a combination of sustained vasodilation of the previously active muscles, centrally mediated reduction in sympathetic nervous activity and resetting of arterial baro- and thermoreflexes. Despite a significant drop in MAP, cerebrovascular function, cerebral autoregulation and middle cerebral arterial flow velocity are generally well maintained following moderate exercise. We tested the hypothesis that intracranial pressure (ICP) is concomitantly decreased during post-exercise arterial hypotension, thereby leaving cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) maintained. Methods Eight healthy volunteers (5 female, age 20+/-2 years, height 169+/-10 cm, weight 64+/-12 kg) were included and baseline measurements recorded after 10 min rest in seated and supine postures in a temperature controlled room (23 C). Each subject completed 30 min exercise at 70% estimated maximum oxygen consumption on an upright ergonomic bicycle followed by a one-hour recovery phase in supine position. MAP, heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were recorded continuously by volume-clamp method using a cuff around the right middle finger (Nexfin). Noninvasive ICP by evoked tympanic membrane displacement (Cerebral Cochlea Fluid Pressure device) was measured before, immediately after and repeated every 10 min during supine recovery. CPP was calculated as the difference between MAP at the level of the brain and ICP. Results ICP decreased by 69+/-41% compared to supine baseline immediately following exercise (from 5.9+/-70.5 nL to -59.1+/-73.0 nL) and gradually returned to pre-exercise supine values after 45 min (P=0.067). This trend was correlated to MAP (r2=0.81, P=0.006), which initially decreased (from 83.9+/-2.4 to 76.6+/-2.9 mmHg) and returned to supine resting values after approximately 30 min. The underlying vasodilation of exercised muscles and reduced venous return were reflected by decreased TPR and SV and correlated to the drop in ICP (r2=0.90, P=0.001 and r2=0.68, P=0.022, respectively), while HR was increased post-exercise (P<0.05) and gradually returned to resting values. CPP was maintained during the supine recovery phase (P=0.1). Discussion Although not reaching statistical significance, our data indicate a drop in ICP following 30 min of aerobic exercise with a gradual increase towards baseline supine values. This trend was significantly correlated with the concomitant decrease in MAP, TRP and SV, while CPP was maintained. Our data are limited by the non-invasive method of obtaining ICP and the small N, which is insufficient to support any conclusion regarding gender differences. Ongoing trials will evaluate a possible augmented intracranial post-exercise hypotension in females compared to males. Although speculative at this point, attenuated concomitant decrease in ICP would decrease CPP which might be a factor in post-exercise syncope.

Abstract
  Background: Pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare and challenging condition. As implied by the nomenclature, the etiologies remain unknown, and multiple etiologies are being investigated. In this study, we explored the potential role of increased systemic or cerebral venous pressure in the pathogenesis. Method(s): An observational cohort study following the STROBE guidelines, including prepubertal children with clinical symptoms and imaging findings consistent with IIH referred to the neurosurgical department, was conducted. The patients underwent a comprehensive diagnostic protocol, including MRI, continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, and endovascular venography with venous pressure measurements. Result(s): The study included 11 consecutive patients (six boys and five girls) with an average age of 2.3 years, and an average BMI of 18.4. Among these, one patient was found to have venous stenosis with a gradient; the other 10 patients presented with normal intracranial anatomy. All patients exhibited elevated venous pressures, with an average superior sagittal sinus pressure of 18.9 mmHg, average internal jugular vein pressure of 17.0 mmHg, and average central venous pressure of 15.9 mmHg. Daytime ICP averaged 12.9 mmHg, whereas nighttime ICP averaged 17.2 mmHg with either A- or B-waves in 10 of the 11 patients. Despite pathological ICP, only three patients had papilledema. Conclusion(s): All patients had an increased systemic venous pressure, indicating a possible pathological factor for prepubertal IIH. Additionally, our findings show that young children often only partly meet the Friedman criteria due to a lack of papilledema, emphasizing the need for pediatric-specific diagnostic criteria. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and to explore the underlying reasons for this increase in venous pressure and potential new treatment avenues.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Background and objectives: Cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis (CVT) present a variety of non-specific clinical signs, but, due to the development of neuroimaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging, their identification has increased in recent years, due to the development of neuroimaging techniques, especially of magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of our study was to identify causes and risk factors, to describe the demographic, clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging data, and to evaluate the treatment and outcome of patients with C.V.T., comparing our experience with international literature. Patients and Methods: We included 30 patients (pts) with CVT, between January1998 and September 2010. The diagnosis was based in all cases on neuroimaging features. The pts were examined at admission and after three months, using the mRS scores. Result(s): Mean age was 37.2 years (SD 8.6), sex ratio: male/female was 1/2. 80% of women were fertile. The main clinical manifestations were headache: 22 pts (73.3%), and papilledema: 16 pts (53.3%). The most frequent neurological syndrome at onset was intracranial hypertension with subacute evolution. CT showed direct signs of dural sinuses thrombosis: (dense triangle sign in 3 pts, delta sign in 7 cases); in 12 pts, we identified a venous cerebral infarct (indirect sign of dural sinuses thrombosis). MRI identified thrombosis of SSS in 21 pts, transverse sinus in 12 cases, cavernous sinus in 3 pts, cerebral edema in 18 pts. In 12 cases, we identified a venous cerebral infarct. 7 out of 30 MRI had a normal CT. DSA revealed isolated cortical veins occlusion, without sinus occlusion in 2 cases (CT, MRI, and MR-A were normal). Risk factors were identified in 22 pts (73.3%); congenital thrombophilia being the most common (9 pts). All pts received anticoagulant therapy. After 90 days from admission, complete resolution of symptoms was seen in 14 cases, minimal neurological deficits in 7 pts, and the death rate was 16.7% (5 pts). Conclusion(s): CVT appear to be underdiagnosed in our region, due to low percentage of admissions for benign intracranial hypertension. CVT was common in women of fertile age, but oral contraceptive was not an important risk factor. The outcome was favorable with adequate therapy.

Abstract
  Retrograde cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare complication following internal jugular vein (IJV) ligation. The patient described in this report is a male in his 30s with locally advanced carcinoma tongue. He underwent near-total glossectomy and bilateral neck dissection. Due to heavy nodal burden, his right IJV had to be sacrificed. The patient presented with features of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) postoperatively. Magnetic resonance venogram of the brain revealed CVT involving sigmoid and transverse sinus. This case report describes a perplexing case of right-sided IJV ligation giving rise to CVT, resulting in raised ICP. Although the contralateral cerebral venous system was found to be normal, it failed to compensate for the obstructed outflow on the affected side. In this case report, we have elucidated the possible mechanism for the development of raised ICP and described the management in the light of existing evidence.Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2024.

Abstract
  The brain-gut axis represents a bidirectional communication linking brain function with the gastrointestinal (GI) system. This interaction comprises a top-down communication from the brain to the gut, and a bottom-up communication from the gut to the brain, including neural, endocrine, immune, and humoral signaling. Acute brain injury (ABI) can lead to systemic complications including GI dysfunction. Techniques for monitoring GI function are currently few, neglected, and many under investigation. The use of ultrasound could provide a measure of gastric emptying, bowel peristalsis, bowel diameter, bowel wall thickness and tissue perfusion. Despite novel biomarkers represent a limitation in clinical practice, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is easy-to-use and measurable at bedside. Increased IAP can be both cause and consequence of GI dysfunction, and it can influence cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure via physiological mechanisms. Here, we address ten good reasons to consider GI function in patients with ABI, highlighting the importance of its assessment in neurocritical care.Copyright © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

Abstract
  Introduction: Cerebral venous sinus stenting (CVSS) is an effective treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) secondary to dural venous sinus stenosis. Traditional selection of patients for CVSS has been made by microcatheter manometry, but pressure measurements are often equivocal. Here we present the results of a series of cases in which venous flat-panel CT (FP-CT) was used as an adjunct to microcatheter manometry to improve decision making and precise stent placement during CVSS. Method(s): Ten consecutive patients with IIH underwent angiography with microcatheter manometry and venous FP-CT, with CVSS if indicated by the results. Cross-sectional measurements of the narrowed sinus were obtained on FP-CT before and after stenting. After the procedure, clinical outcomes were tracked. Follow-up with quantitative MRA with sinus flow measurements was also performed, when available. Result(s): There was an exponential correlation between measured pressure gradient and degree of stenosis calculated using venous FP-CT. All patients with both a high degree of stenosis measured by FP-CT and a high pressure gradient across the stenosis showed a clinical benefit from stenting. Conclusion(s): True measurement of the cross-sectional area of the dural sinus, made by venous phase FP-CT, has a high degree of correlation with elevated venous pressure gradient across the point of stenosis. Even in a limited series of cases, we found an exponential decrease in flow with increasing severity of stenosis. Furthermore, patients with both an elevated venous pressure gradient and critical stenosis of the sinus on FP-CT showed symptomatic improvement after stenting.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  A 36-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with clinical symptoms of blurred vision of progressive onset of two years of evolution. The ophthalmological examination revealed the existence of bilateral papilledema. Using cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the presence of a right occipital pial arteriovenous malformation was certified. Arteriographically, pial arterial contributions dependent on the right middle cerebral artery and the right posterior cerebral artery were identified. Venous drainage was located at the level of the superior sagittal sinus. An associated right transverse sinus stenosis was also identified. The existence of secondary intracranial hypertension was corroborated by monitoring with an intracranial pressure sensor. An interventional procedure was carried out consisting of embolization of the arterial supplies of the lesion using Onyx. The clinical-radiological findings after the procedure were favorable: the papilledema disappeared and complete exclusion of the malformation was achieved. A new intracranial pressure measurement showed resolution of intracranial hypertension. Subsequent regulated radiological controls showed complete exclusion of the malformation up to 5 years later.Copyright © 2024 Sociedad Espanola de Neurocirugia

Abstract
  Paediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is often characterised by its rapidity of onset and potential for significant morbidity and even mortality. Patients often develop multiorgan dysfunction/failure, including severe acute kidney injury (AKI). Whilst the management of PALF focuses on complications of hepatic dysfunction, the associated kidney impairment can significantly affect patient outcomes. Severe AKI requiring continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) is a common complication of both PALF and liver transplantation. In both scenarios, the need for CKRT is a poor prognostic indicator. In adults, AKI has been shown to complicate ALF in 25-50% of cases. In PALF, the incidence of AKI is often higher compared to other critically ill paediatric ICU populations, with reports of up to 40% in some observational studies. Furthermore, those presenting with AKI regularly have a more severe grade of PALF at presentation. Observational studies in the paediatric population corroborate this, though data are not as robust-mainly reflecting single-centre cohorts. Perioperative benefits of CKRT include helping to clear water-soluble toxins such as ammonia, balancing electrolytes, preventing fluid overload, and managing raised intracranial pressure. As liver transplantation often takes 6-10 h, it is proposed that these benefits could be extended to the intraoperative period, avoiding any hiatus. Intraoperative CKRT (IoCKRT) has been shown to be practicable, safe and may help sicker recipients tolerate the operation with outcomes analogous with less ill patients not requiring IoCKRT.

Abstract
  Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a type of fibroblastic neoplasm that can occur in various parts of the body, with SFT of the pineal gland being exceedingly rare. We report the case of a 58-year-old male presenting with recurrent hiccups, acid reflux, and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an occupying lesion in the pineal region, suggestive of a neoplastic process. Intraoperatively, the lesion was located in the pineal region, exhibiting a grayish-red color, and was largely resected. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor (CNS WHO Grade 1). Postoperatively, the patient was supplemented with radiotherapy, and long-term follow-up showed no signs of recurrence or metastasis.Copyright © 2024 He, He, Wang, Ji, Xie and Zou.

Abstract
  Purpose of Review: To review the tests of fluid responsiveness and volume status with critical care echocardiography, including their uses, performance, and limitations. Recent Findings: Fluid overload is detrimental to critically ill patients. Dynamic parameters of fluid responsiveness are able to predict which patients will respond to a fluid bolus with an increase in cardiac output. These tests include the passive leg raise, stroke volume variation, vena cava variability, and the end expiratory occlusion maneuver. Summary: Critical care echocardiography can be used to evaluate changes in preload and stroke volume during performance of dynamic fluid responsiveness tests. The LVOT VTI is a central parameter used to estimate changes in stroke volume in real time during performance of these tests.Copyright © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

Abstract
  Background: Optimization of ventilatory settings is challenging for patients in the neurointensive care unit, requiring a balance between precise gas exchange control, lung protection, and managing hemodynamic effects of positive pressure ventilation. Although recruitment maneuvers (RMs) may enhance oxygenation, they could also exert profound undesirable systemic impacts. Method(s): The single-center, prospective study investigated the effects of RMs (up-titration of positive end-expiratory pressure) on multimodal neuromonitoring in patients with acute brain injury. Our primary focus was on intracranial pressure and secondarily on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and other neurological parameters: cerebral autoregulation [pressure reactivity index (PRx)] and regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2). We also assessed blood pressure and right ventricular (RV) function evaluated using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion. Results are expressed as the difference (DELTA) from baseline values obtained after completing the RMs. Result(s): Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study. RMs resulted in increased intracranial pressure (DELTA = 4.8 mm Hg) and reduced CPP (DELTACPP = -12.8 mm Hg) and mean arterial pressure (difference in mean arterial pressure = -5.2 mm Hg) (all p < 0.001). Cerebral autoregulation worsened (DELTAPRx = 0.31 a.u.; p < 0.001). Despite higher systemic oxygenation (difference in partial pressure of O2 = 4 mm Hg; p = 0.001) and unchanged carbon dioxide levels, rSO2 marginally decreased (DELTArSO2 = -0.5%; p = 0.031), with a significant drop in arterial content and increase in the venous content. RV systolic function decreased (difference in tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion = -0.1 cm; p < 0.001) with a tendency toward increased RV basal diameter (p = 0.06). Grouping patients according to DELTACPP or DELTAPRx revealed that those with poorer tolerance to RMs had higher CPP (p = 0.040) and a larger RV basal diameter (p = 0.034) at baseline. Conclusion(s): In patients with acute brain injury, RMs appear to have adverse effects on cerebral hemodynamics. These findings might be partially explained by RM's impact on RV function. Further advanced echocardiography monitoring is required to prove this hypothesis.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Numerous driven techniques have been utilized to assess dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) in healthy and clinical populations. The current review aimed to amalgamate this literature and provide recommendations to create greater standardization for future research. The PubMed database was searched with inclusion criteria consisting of original research articles using driven dCA assessments in humans. Risk of bias were completed using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies. Meta-analyses were conducted for coherence, phase, and gain metrics at 0.05 and 0.10 Hz using deep-breathing, oscillatory lower body negative pressure (OLBNP), sit-to-stand maneuvers, and squat-stand maneuvers. A total of 113 studies were included, with 40 of these incorporating clinical populations. A total of 4126 participants were identified, with younger adults (18-40 years) being the most studied population. The most common techniques were squat-stands (n = 43), deep-breathing (n = 25), OLBNP (n = 20), and sit-to-stands (n = 16). Pooled coherence point estimates were: OLBNP 0.70 (95%CI:0.59-0.82), sit-to-stands 0.87 (95%CI:0.79-0.95), and squat-stands 0.98 (95%CI:0.98-0.99) at 0.05 Hz; and deep-breathing 0.90 (95%CI:0.81-0.99); OLBNP 0.67 (95%CI:0.44-0.90); and squat-stands 0.99 (95%CI:0.99-0.99) at 0.10 Hz. This review summarizes clinical findings, discusses the pros/cons of the 11 unique driven techniques included, and provides recommendations for future investigations into the unique physiological intricacies of dCA.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  In spite of expanding research, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and its spectrum conditions remain challenging to treat. The failure to develop effective treatment strategies is largely due to poor agreement on a coherent disease pathogenesis model. Herein we provide a hypothesis of a unifying model centered around the internal jugular veins (IJV) to explain the development of IIH, which contends the following: (1) the IJV are prone to both physiological and pathological compression throughout their course, including compression near C1 and the styloid process, dynamic muscular/carotid compression from C3 to C6, and lymphatic compression; (2) severe dynamic IJV stenosis with developments of large cervical gradients is common in IIH-spectrum patients and significantly impacts intracranial venous and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures; (3) pre-existing IJV stenosis may be exacerbated by infectious/inflammatory etiologies that induce retromandibular cervical lymphatic hypertrophy; (4) extra-jugular venous collaterals dilate with chronic use but are insufficient resulting in impaired aggregate cerebral venous outflow; (5) poor IJV outflow initiates, or in conjunction with other factors, contributes to intracranial venous hypertension and congestion leading to higher CSF pressures and intracranial pressure (ICP); (6) glymphatic congestion occurs but is insufficient to compensate and this pathway becomes overwhelmed; and (7) elevated intracranial CSF pressures triggers extramural venous sinus stenosis in susceptible individuals that amplifies ICP elevation producing severe clinical manifestations. Future studies must focus on establishing norms for dynamic cerebral venous outflow and IJV physiology in the absence of disease so that we may better understand and define the diseased state.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Background: Individualised bedside adjustment of mechanical ventilation is a standard strategy in acute coma neurocritical care patients. This involves customising positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which could improve ventilation homogeneity and arterial oxygenation. This study aimed to determine whether PEEP titrated by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) results in different lung ventilation homogeneity when compared to standard PEEP of 5 cmH2O in mechanically ventilated patients with healthy lungs. Method(s): In this prospective single-centre study, we evaluated 55 acute adult neurocritical care patients starting controlled ventilation with PEEPs close to 5 cmH2O. Next, the optimal PEEP was identified by EIT-guided decremental PEEP titration, probing PEEP levels between 9 and 2 cmH2O and finding the minimal amount of collapse and overdistension. EIT-derived parameters of ventilation homogeneity were evaluated before and after the PEEP titration and after the adjustment of PEEP to its optimal value. Non-EIT-based parameters, such as peripheral capillary Hb saturation (SpO2) and end-tidal pressure of CO2, were recorded hourly and analysed before PEEP titration and after PEEP adjustment. Result(s): The mean PEEP value before titration was 4.75 +/- 0.94 cmH2O (ranging from 3 to max 8 cmH2O), 4.29 +/- 1.24 cmH2O after titration and before PEEP adjustment, and 4.26 +/- 1.5 cmH2O after PEEP adjustment. No statistically significant differences in ventilation homogeneity were observed due to the adjustment of PEEP found by PEEP titration. We also found non-significant changes in non-EIT-based parameters following the PEEP titration and subsequent PEEP adjustment, except for the mean arterial pressure, which dropped statistically significantly (with a mean difference of 3.2 mmHg, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.0 cmH2O, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Adjusting PEEP to values derived from PEEP titration guided by EIT does not provide any significant changes in ventilation homogeneity as assessed by EIT to ventilated patients with healthy lungs, provided the change in PEEP does not exceed three cmH2O. Thus, a reduction in PEEP determined through PEEP titration that is not greater than 3 cmH2O from an initial value of 5 cmH2O is unlikely to affect ventilation homogeneity significantly, which could benefit mechanically ventilated neurocritical care patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Introduction: Tumors that invade or compress the venous sinuses have the potential to impair venous drainage. Rarely, this may be so severe as to induce intracranial hypertension. Other studies have previously described venous sinus stenting (VSS) for the treatment of these symptomatic lesions. In this report, we present our series of eight cases of VSS for symptomatic tumor-induced venous sinus stenosis and review the existing literature. Cases: Eight patients with mostly intracranial tumors were found to have symptomatic venous sinus stenosis with the most common presenting symptom being elevated intracranial pressure. Six of the eight (75%) patients presented with papilledema on neuro-ophthalmological exam. The most affected locations were the transverse and sigmoid sinuses in four patients, followed by the superior sagittal sinus in three patients. All eight patients underwent VSS with no adverse events. In total, 6 out of 8 (75%) of patients had complete resolution of their symptoms, while the remaining patients experienced at least partial improvement. Conclusion(s): Tumors that cause symptomatic venous sinus stenosis may be successfully managed with VSS to improve venous drainage. This may facilitate continued conservative management of meningiomas or allow for treatment with noninvasive means, such as stereotactic radiosurgery. Depending on the size of the target stenosis, balloon-mounted coronary stents may be a suitable option to treat these lesions.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) mainly affects obese young women, causing elevated intracranial pressure, headaches, and papilledema, risking vision loss and severe headaches. Despite weight loss as the primary treatment, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent research explores novel therapeutic targets. Aim(s): This review aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of IIH's pathophysiology and clinical features to inform pathogenesis and improve treatment strategies. Method(s): Recent publications on IIH were searched and summarized using PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE. Result(s): The review highlights potential pathomechanisms and therapeutic advances in IIH. Conclusion(s): IIH incidence is rising, with growing evidence linking it to metabolic and hormonal disturbances. Early diagnosis and treatment remain challenging.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Abstract
  METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was performed on patients with CVD that underwent IJV stenting procedures. RESULT(S): From 2019 to 2023, 29 patients with CVD underwent a total of 33 IJV stenting procedures. Most patients (20; 69%) had an underlying connective tissue disorder diagnosis. The mean age of the included patients was 36.3 years (SD 12.4), 24 were female (82.8%), and all were Caucasian except for 2 patients (27; 93.0%). Twenty-eight procedures (85%) involved isolated IJV stenting under conscious sedation, whereas 5 procedures (15%) involved IJV stenting and concomitant transverse sinus stenting under general anesthesia. Thirteen (39%) patients underwent IJV stenting after open IJV decompression and styloidectomy. Three patients had stents placed for stenosis below the C1 tubercle, one of which was for carotid compression. Periprocedural complications occurred in 11 (33%), including intracardiac stent migration in 1 patient, temporary shoulder pain/weakness in 5 (15%), and persistent and severe shoulder pain/weakness in 2 patients (6%). Approximately 75% of patients demonstrated improvement after stenting although only 12 patients (36%) had durable improvement over a mean follow-up of 4.5 months (range 6 weeks-3.5 years). CONCLUSION(S): Our experience, along with early published studies, suggests that there is significant promise to IJV revascularization techniques in these patients; however, stenting carries a high complication rate, and symptom recurrence is common. Most neurointerventionalists should not be performing IJV stenting unless they have experience with these patients and understand technical nuances (stent sizing, anatomy, patient selection), which can maximize benefit and minimize risk.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2024.

Abstract
  Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) redistributes blood from the upper body to the lower body. LBNP may prove to be a countermeasure for the multifaceted physiological changes endured by astronauts during spaceflight related to cephalad fluid shift. Over more than five decades, beginning with the era of Skylab, advancements in LBNP technology have expanded our understanding of neurological, ophthalmological, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal adaptations in space, with particular emphasis on mitigating issues such as bone loss. To date however, no comprehensive review has been conducted that chronicles the evolution of this technology or elucidates the broad-spectrum potential of LBNP in managing the diverse physiological challenges encountered in the microgravity environment. Our study takes a chronological perspective, systematically reviewing the historical development and application of LBNP technology in relation to the various pathophysiological impacts of spaceflight. The primary objective is to illustrate how this technology, as it has evolved, offers an increasingly sophisticated lens through which to interpret the systemic effects of space travel on human physiology. We contend that the insights gained from LBNP studies can significantly aid in formulating targeted and effective countermeasures to ensure the health and safety of astronauts. Ultimately, this paper aspires to promote a more cohesive understanding of the broad applicability of LBNP as a countermeasure against multiple bodily effects of space travel, thereby contributing to a safer and more scientifically informed approach to human space exploration.Copyright © 2024 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR)

Abstract
  Long-duration spaceflight (LDSF) is associated with unique hazards and linked with numerous human health risks including Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). The proposed mechanisms for SANS include microgravity induced cephalad fluid shift and increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP). SANS is a disorder seen only after LDSF and has no direct terrestrial pathologic counterpart as the zero G environment cannot be completely replicated on Earth. Head-down tilt, bed rest studies however have been used as a terrestrial analog and produce the cephalad fluid shift. Some proposed countermeasures for SANS include vasoconstrictive thigh cuffs and lower body negative pressure. Another potential researched countermeasure is the impedance threshold device (ITD) which can reduce ICP. We review the mechanisms of the ITD and its potential use as a countermeasure for SANS.Copyright © 2024

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a cerebrovascular disease with increased intracranial pressure from impaired cerebral venous drainage and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid. There is a lack of evidence to prove the benefits and risks of thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapies. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the therapeutic effect of carotid artery puncture injections of urokinase combined with warfarin in patients with CVST. METHOD(S): Thirty-six patients with CVST who received a carotid artery puncture injection of urokinase combined with warfarin were retrospectively analyzed in the urokinase group, while 30 patients with CVST received subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and warfarin, as the control group. Clinical parameters, imaging data, laboratory test data, treatment plans, and follow-up information were collected and compared. RESULT(S): At discharge, the GCS score was higher in the urokinase group than that in the control group. In the urokinase group, no patient died. Recanalization of the venous sinus trunk was observed in 32 patients. While two patients died in the control group, recanalization of the venous sinus trunk was achieved in 20 patients. A follow-up examination showed that recovery in the urokinase group was also better than that in the control group. CONCLUSION(S): This study suggests that carotid artery puncture injection of urokinase combined with warfarin is a safe and effective option for CVST, can reduce CVST recurrence. However, this was a retrospective study with a relatively small sample size, and future studies are needed to confirm the procedure's feasibility.Copyright © 2024 Asian Surgical Association and Taiwan Society of Coloproctology.

Abstract
  Purpose ; While it has been observed that gravity inversion increases intraocular pressure (IOP), the relative changes in ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) are less well documented. In this interventional study we sought to estimate the change in translaminar pressure difference (TLPD) using changes in retinal venous pulsation (RVP). We also aimed to measure which ocular structures changed with the change in IOP, and changes in ganglion cell stress with electrophysiology, while sitting and inverted. Methods : We recorded from 15 healthy volunteers, and 5 patients with glaucoma and conditions of interest. The IOP was collected with rebound tonometry (iCare), BP was measured manually with the arm raised to the ear, so the measurement was at the level of the eye. Infrared videos of the optic disc, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula and optic disc, and macula retinal OCT angiography (OCTA) were obtained with Heidelberg Spectralis OCT2. In a subset of volunteers we measured photopic negative response (PhNR) amplitudes using a Diagnosys Espion system. All measurements were taken in both a sitting and inverted position (typically -45 degrees below supine). Results : The IOP increased immediately and predictably with inversion, behaving like a physical fluid column of around 0.3 m (average 16 mmHg sitting, 30 mmHg inverted). Mean arterial BP measured at the level of the eye increased from 71 to 98 mmHg with inversion, resulting in a small increase in OPP (from 56 to 68 mmHg) and a corresponding autoregulation vasoconstriction response evident on OCTA. There was no change in retinal venous pulsation (RVP) amplitude for the majority of participants, although some individuals had increased or decreased RVP with inversion. On OCT imaging, the clearest change with inversion was an increase in choroidal thickness. Inversion for 15 minutes was not associated with a statistically significant change in PhNR signal. Conclusions : Driven by increased venous pressures, inversion caused an immediate and similar increase in IOP and ICP, and venous pulsations remained unchanged in most participants suggesting little change in TLPD. The BP increased more than IOP with inversion, so OPP increased and vasoconstriction was evident. These findings have implications for advice given to patients with glaucoma or intracranial hypertension. (Figure Presented).

Abstract
  Introduction: Valsalva maneuver (VM; forced expiration against a closed glottis) can be active (in awake patients), accidental (straining/lifting weight), or passive (intraoperatively by positive pressure technique in manual mode). Rise in intrathoracic pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and bradycardia occur during phase-I of VM followed by a rise in intracranial pressure in phase-II with accompanying fall in MAP and tachycardia.1 Surgeons often request VM intraoperatively (thyroidectomy, head-neck surgery, craniotomy) to unmask covert venous bleeders and detect CSF leaks2,3,4 Observing the airway pressure values on the monitor during traditional VM administration by the intermittent positive pressure technique1,4 revealed delivery of a highly variable airway pressure which seldom reached the set 40 cmH2O mark with this subjective technique. We aimed to compare an anesthesia machine-generated objective technique for delivering VM under pressure controlled (PC) mode and the traditional subjective technique of delivering VM in manual mode. Method(s): This prospective, interventional, two arm, single-centric randomized controlled study was conducted at a tertiary care oncology setup. Written informed consent from all patients, and scientific and ethics committee approvals were obtained. The study included 60 adult ASA I-II patients randomly allocated into two groups: manual VM group (Group-M; n=30) and controlled ventilation VM group (Group-C; n=30) by computer-generated block-randomization, with group allocation concealed in sealed opaque envelopes. VM was performed after endotracheal intubation and arterial line placement but before surgical incision. Fresh gas flow was fixed at 2l/min in both groups. In Group M, the ventilator was put on manual/spontaneous mode and the APL-valve was partially closed to 40cmH2 O. The reservoir bag was manually compressed and maintained for 20 sec. Group-C patients were placed on PC-mode with 40cmH2 O pressure setting, PEEP 35cmH2 O, and R/R 3 breaths/min (inherent safety feature of our workstation) to deliver 20sec of 35-40 cmH2 O airway pressure (40 cmH2 O during inspiration; 35 cmH2 O during expiration). MAP, heart rate (HR), and internal jugular vein diameter (IJVD) were measured at 7 time points (T0 = baseline, T1 = initiation of VM, T2 = 20 secs after VM initiation, T3 = VM release, T4 = 1min, T5 = 2min and T6 = 5 min post-VM). VM was repeated after tumor resection for unmasking covert bleeders and surgeon satisfaction was noted in both groups. Our primary outcome measures were MAP, HR and IJVD measured at pre-determined time points. Our secondary outcome measure was surgeon satisfaction. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and percentages. Independent sample t-test for intergroup and paired sample t-test for intragroup comparison of normally distributed, quantitative variables were performed. Results were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation, dotted box-whisker plots, trendlines, and correlograms. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): All patients of either sex, aged 18-60 years, weighing 45-80kg undergoing head-neck surgery requiring an arterial line were included (Table 1). Patients with aortic stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, recent myocardial infarction, glaucoma, retinopathy, etc were excluded. In both groups, the intragroup analysis revealed no statistically significant change, in baseline HR versus HR at all other time points. Intragroup analysis of MAP in both the groups showed a rise in MAP compared to baseline at T1 , a fall in MAP at T2 and T3 , rise at T4 followed by a fall at T5 and T6 (Table 2). The difference in mean HR at T0 , T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 , T5, and T6 was statistically insignificant between the two groups. MAP at T0 and T1 , in both groups, was comparable. After 20 secs of VM, there was a statistically significant greater fall in MAP in Group-C as compared to Group-M (p=0.018). At T3 , the mean MAP was significantly lower in Group C versus Group M (p= 0.021). At T4 , T5 and T6 , mean MAP was comparable between the two groups (Table 3). VM performed in the PC mode produced greater IJV dilatation (p= 0.004; p= 0.044; Table-1; Figure-1). The correlogram depicts the Pearsons coefficient for correlation between changes in HR, MAP, and IJV diameter (Table 4). Conclusion(s): Performing VM in PC mode is a better technique based on hemodynamics, IJVD, unmasking of bleeders, and surgeon satisfaction. It could potentially become the new standard of administering intraoperative VM. (Figure Presented).

Abstract
  Introduction The eShunt Implant is a novel, endovascular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt developed to treat communicating hydrocephalus. The transdural Implant's self-expanding anchor resides within the cerebellopontine angle subarachnoid cistern and tubular body resides within the inferior petrosal dural venous sinus, draining CSF into the internal jugular vein. A differential pressure valve allows 10 cc/hr CSF outflow at physiologic pressures and prevents backflow during transient retrograde pressure spikes. Aim of Study We present safety results through one-year in the first series of treated patients. Methods Patients across three different hydrocephalus etiologies were implanted: normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), intractable hydrocephalus post-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (paSAH), and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Radiologic evaluation by MR or CT and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scoring occurred at one-year and was compared to baseline. Results Fourteen treated patients completed one-year followup: nine NPH (4 female; mean 75.7+/-7.3 years), four paSAH (3 female; mean 57.5+/-16.5 years), and one IIH (1 male, 50 years). No observations of radiologic or symptomatic overdrainage occurred. No instances of procedural or delayed subarachnoid, intraparenchymal or subdural hemorrhage occurred. Cross-sectional imaging immediately post-operatively compared to one-year confirmed Implant stability without antegrade or retrograde migration. mRS scores were either stable or improved compared to baseline. Conclusion The eShunt Implant was designed as a permanent implant to drain CSF into the venous system. These preliminary results indicate a potentially acceptable long-term safety profile for treating communicating hydrocephalus. A planned clinical trial will provide a comprehensive safety assessment in a large population of patients.

Abstract
  The cerebral blood flow, CBF, is an important clinical parameter in neuro-intensive care. The possibility to continuously monitor CBF, computed from referential ICP, rICP (calculated from measured intracranial pressure, ICP, and central venous pressure, CVP) and venous outflow resistance, Rv, could importantly improve patient care. For the CBF(1) method the pulsative part of CBF (with rICP increase due to vascular volume increase) gives the venous outflow resistance, Rv. The CBF max method finds Rv from the close correlation between rICP and Rv. For both CBF(1) and CBF max, rICP divided with Rv gives CBF. The parameters rICP, Rv and CBF were calculated from measurements of ICP increase, and of intracerebral venous volume increase in nine subjects, by the CBF(1) method. The result, together with the finding of a close correlation between rICP and Rv, which made CBF dependent on rICP only, gave confirmation of the theory for computation of CBF, with two methods for continuous monitoring of CBF from rICP, one (CBF(1)) using the systolic ICP increase to find Rv, and one (CBF max) using the relationship between Rv and rICP at rICP exceeding about 10 mmHg in this study.Copyright © 2024.

Abstract
  Background: Shunt blockage remains a problem, and its diagnosis is challenging given the overlap of clinical symptoms with other, non-shunt-related, conditions. M.Scios, previously known as Sensor Reservoirs, enable regular non-invasive measurement of ICP. This is instrumental in the management of CSF shunts and complex hydrocephalus and is particularly advantageous when more regular surveillance is needed, for example during management of patients with complex symptom morphology or multiple valve adjustments. Here we characterise the waveform morphology from an M.Scio during shunt blockage to provide a reference on interpretation to inform clinical decision-making. Method(s): A single-centre case series of patients at the National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery with M.Scio/Sensor Reservoirs (Christoph Miethke, GmbH & Co) incorporated into their shunt systems. M.Scio readings were taken during hydrocephalus clinics or on the ward, using the reader unit set. Measurements were interpreted using ICPicture software (Christoph Miethke, GmbH & Co). Result(s): 4 patients (50% female; age range 34 to 46) with M.Scios incorporated into their shunt systems had confirmed shunt blockage. Indication for CSF diversion included: idiopathic intracranial hypertension (50%), congenital hydrocephalus (25%), and aqueduct obstruction post-surgery (25%). Patients with blocked proximal shunt catheters were found to have a sinusoidal 'flatline' waveform similar to asystole, commonly with an extremely negative pressure, as low as -60mmHg. Shunt blockage was confirmed at revision and symptoms of shunt malfunction resolved after revision. Imaging available for one patient also concurred with the M.Scio waveform, showing blockage of the proximal catheter. Conclusion(s): Here we present the first description of the waveform seen from an M.Scio during shunt blockage. This provides evidence to support the clinical utility of both M.Scios and ICPicture software in the improvement of patient management.Copyright © 2022

Abstract
  Objective: To investigate the utility of non-invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure waveforms (ICPw) in assessing changes in P2/P1 ratios among pregnant patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and hydrocephalus. The study aims to elucidate whether fluctuations in these ratios correlate with symptom severity during pregnancy and postpartum periods, thereby exploring the potential for this monitoring technique to serve as a diagnostic or prognostic tool for clinical management of these conditions. Background(s): Pregnancy can exacerbate the symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and hydrocephalus due to increases in abdominal pressure. Non-invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure waveforms (ICPw) may provide insights into the neurophysiology of these conditions during pregnancy. The present case series describes two pregnant patients with IIH and hydrocephalus, who were monitored with a non-invasive device to assess changes in their P2/P1 ratios during pregnancy. Design/Methods: Two pregnant patients, one with IIH and one with hydrocephalus, were monitored with a non-invasive device to assess changes in their P2/P1 ratios during pregnancy. Symptoms were also evaluated. Result(s): Both patients showed an increase in their P2/P1 ratios during pregnancy, which correlated with progressively worsening symptoms. After delivery, both patients showed improvement in symptoms, as well as a normalization of their P2/P1 ratios. Conclusion(s): The present case series suggests that non-invasive monitoring of ICPw can provide insights into the neurophysiology of IIH and hydrocephalus during pregnancy. The increase in P2/P1 ratios during pregnancy may be indicative of worsening symptoms, and normalization of P2/P1 ratios after delivery may be coincide with symptom improvement. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings and translate them into clinical use, such the ability to have baseline parameters that may help with faster identification of shunt dysfunction, for example. .

Abstract
  Background Cerebral venous pressures, sinus trans-stenosis gradients, and intracranial pressures are thought to be influenced by head position. Objective To investigate the intracranial manifestations of these changes in patients with cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVD). Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted on 22 consecutive adult patients who underwent diagnostic cerebral venography with rotational internal jugular vein (IJV) venography and superior sagittal sinus (SSS) pressure measurements in multiple head positions. Data on venous sinus pressures, IJV pressures, and lumbar puncture (LP) opening pressures (OP) were collected and analyzed. Results The study found that 21 (96%) patients experienced increases in SSS pressures with head rotation, with a mean increase of 25.4%. Intracranial trans-stenosis gradients showed significant variability with head position. Additionally, LP OP measurements increased by an average of 44.3% with head rotation. Dynamic IJV stenosis was observed in all patients during rotational testing. Conclusion Head position significantly affects cerebral venous pressures, trans-stenosis gradients, and intracranial pressures in patients with CVD or intracranial hypertension. These findings highlight the need for dynamic venography in the diagnostic evaluation of these conditions to better understand their pathophysiology and improve treatment strategies.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

Abstract
  Neurological long Covid (NLC) is a major post-acute sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting up to 10% of infected patients. The clinical presentation of patients with NLC is varied, but general NLC symptoms have been noted to closely mimic symptoms of cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVD). Here we review key literature and discuss evidence supporting this comparison. We also aimed to describe the similarity between CVD symptomatology and neuro-NLC symptoms from two perspectives: a Twitter-distributed survey for long covid sufferers to estimate nature and frequency of neurological symptoms, and through a small cohort of patients with long covid who underwent CVD work up per our standard workflow. Over 700 patients responded, and we argue that there is a close symptom overlap with those of CVD. CVD workup in a series of 6 patients with neurological long COVID symptoms showed jugular vein stenosis by CT venography and varying degrees of increased intracranial pressure. Finally, we discuss the potential pathogenic association between vascular inflammation, associated with COVID-19 infection, venous outflow congestion, and its potential involvement in NLC.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Introduction: Globally, severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death among those under 40, demanding effective treatments to prevent secondary hypoxic brain damage and improve outcomes. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in TBI patients significantly raises mortality rates to 50%. Lung-protective ventilation strategies for ARDS can increase central venous pressure, adversely affecting TBI care by potentially raising intracranial pressure and reducing cerebral perfusion. Moreover, maintaining higher cerebral perfusion pressures in TBI has been linked to increased ARDS risk. Addressing these contrasting treatment needs, we turn to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), particularly veno-venous ECMO (VV-ECMO). VV-ECMO enables gas exchange in an artificial lung, reducing ventilator-associated lung damage and resting the lungs. However, ECMO's requirement for anticoagulation therapy poses challenges in polytrauma cases with TBI, due to the high bleeding risk. Method(s): We aimed to create a second-hit rat model using Sprague- Dawley rats to induce ARDS following TBI. For this, we employed Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI) to produce consistent cerebral contusions. The rat's skull was exposed, and a 4 mm diameter circle at the midpoint between Lambda and Bregma, 0.5 mm from the midline, was prepared to expose the dura mater. Using an actuator with a velocity of 3 m/sec and a deformation depth of 1.2-2.0 mm, we created a severe TBI model. ARDS was then induced by intratracheal administration of 50ug LPS post-TBI. In our ECMO rat model, we set up a circuit with blood and return cannulas (right internal jugular vein, right femoral vein), a driving pump, an artificial lung, and an air trap chamber. A cannula was inserted into the femoral artery for physiological monitoring, blood gas analysis, and coagulation-fibrinolysis system testing. Result(s): We successfully introduced ECMO into a second-hit rat model that induces ARDS following TBI, completing the post-TBI ECMO model.We plan to measure coagulation-fibrinolysis and endothelial injury markers every two hours immediately after ECMO initiation, hypothesizing that the timing of ECMO introduction will affect these responses. Future comparative longitudinal studies will be conducted between the ECMO introduction group and the non-introduction group. Additionally, we will vary the ECMO introduction timing from immediately after TBI to 12, 24, and 48 hours post-injury to examine changes in various parameters. Conclusion(s): The establish of post-TBI ECMO model has been completed. Future comparative longitudinal studies will be conducted between the ECMO introduction group and the non-introduction group.

Abstract
  The vein of Rolando, also known as the central sulcal vein, is a critical superficial cerebral vein located in the central sulcus, playing a pivotal role in the venous drainage of the motor and sensory cortices. Named after the Italian anatomist Luigi Rolando, this vein serves as a crucial anatomical landmark in neurosurgery, guiding surgeons to approach critical brain structures with minimal damage. This article explores the anatomy and clinical significance of the vein of Rolando, emphasizing its role in neurosurgery and neuroimaging. Advanced imaging techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI), Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV), and CT Angiography have enhanced the ability to diagnose and preserve this vein, reducing surgical risks. The article also discusses the interconnectedness of the vein of Rolando with other cerebral veins like the vein of Trolard and underscores the importance of understanding venous variations and drainage patterns for successful surgical outcomes. Preventive measures to protect the vein during neurosurgery are essential to prevent complications such as venous congestion and intracranial pressure. This overview highlights the necessity for precise anatomical knowledge and advanced diagnostic tools in optimizing neurosurgical procedures and patient care.Copyright © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

Abstract
  Background: Intrahospital transportation (IHT) of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and may have adverse consequences, incurring inherent risks. The data on the frequency and severity of clinical complications linked with IHT are contradictory, and there is no agreement on whether it is safe or potentially challenging for neurocritical care unit patients. Continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is essential in neurointensive care. The role of ICP monitoring and management of cerebral autoregulation impairments in IHT of patients with severe TBI is underinvestigated. The purpose of this nonrandomized retrospective single-center study was to assess the dynamics of ICP and an improved pressure reactivity index (iPRx) as a measure of autoregulation during IHT. Method(s): Seventy-seven men and fourteen women with severe TBI admitted in 2012-2022 with a mean age of 33.2 +/- 5.2 years were studied. ICP and arterial pressure were invasively monitored, and cerebral perfusion pressure and iPRx were calculated from the measured parameters. All patients were subjected to dynamic helical computed tomography angiography using a 64-slice scanner Philips Ingenuity computed tomography scan 1-2 days after TBI. Statistical analysis of all results was done using a paired t-test, and p was preset at < 0.05. The logistic regression analysis was performed for cerebral ischemia development dependent on intracranial hypertension and cerebrovascular reactivity. Result(s): IHT led to an increase in ICP in all the patients, especially during vertical movement in an elevator (maximum 75.2 mm Hg). During the horizontal transportation on the floor, ICP remained increased (p < 0.05). The mean ICP during IHT was significantly higher (26.1 +/- 13.5 mm Hg, p < 0.001) than that before the IHT (19.9 +/- 5.3 mm Hg). The mean iPRx after and before IHT was 0.52 +/- 0.04 and 0.23 +/- 0.14, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Both horizontal and vertical transportation causes a significant increase in ICP and iPRx in patients with severe TBI, potentially leading to the outcome worsening.Copyright © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society 2023.

Abstract
  Venous sinus stenting for dural venous sinus outflow obstruction due to an intrinsic filling obstruction or extrinsic stenosis is an increasingly popular treatment strategy for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and isolated pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The most common site of stenosis is the lateral venous sinus at the transverse-sigmoid junction. Approximately 10% of the population has a persistent occipital venous sinus (OVS), a variant that may be the dominant venous drainage pathway in the setting of a hypoplastic or aplastic transverse sinus. OVS stenosis has been rarely associated with IIH and isolated PT with only a handful published cases. We herein report a retrospective series of OVS stenting in five patients, four of whom presented with non-IIH PT and one with IIH.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract
  Venous sinus stenosis has garnered increasing academic attention as a potential etiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The complex anatomy of the cerebral venous sinuses and veins plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of these conditions. Venous sinus stenosis, often found in the superior sagittal or transverse sinus, can lead to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and characteristic IIH symptoms. Stenosis, variations in dural venous anatomy, and flow dominance patterns contribute to aberrant flow and subsequent PT. Accurate imaging plays a vital role in diagnosis, and magnetic resonance (MR) venography is particularly useful for detecting stenosis. Management strategies for IIH and PT focus on treating the underlying disease, weight management, medical interventions, and, in severe cases, surgical or endovascular procedures. Recently, venous sinus stenting has gained interest as a minimally invasive treatment option for IIH and PT. Stenting addresses venous sinus stenosis, breaking the feedback loop between elevated ICP and stenosis, thus reducing ICP and promoting cerebrospinal fluid outflow. The correction and resolution of flow aberrances can also mitigate or resolve PT symptoms. While venous sinus stenting remains an emerging field, initial results are promising. Further research is needed to refine patient selection criteria and evaluate the long-term efficacy of stenting as compared to traditional treatments.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  Background: Some patient positions employed to facilitate neurosurgery can compromise cerebral venous drainage and lead to increased intracranial pressure, intraoperative bleeding, and brain bulge. This study evaluated the impact of different surgical positions on internal jugular vein (IJV) flow as a measure of cerebral venous drainage and on optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) as an indirect assessment of intracranial pressure. Method(s): Ninety patients scheduled for elective primary brain tumor resection surgery were included in 3 groups of 30 each according to the surgical position: supine, prone, or lateral. Bilateral IJV flow was recorded at 3-time points: before the induction of anesthesia in the supine position (T0), 10 minutes after the induction of anesthesia in the supine position (T1), and 10 minutes after final positioning (T2). The ONSD was measured at T1 and T2. Result(s): Mean IJV flow decreased from baseline by 36%, 10% and 38% in the supine, prone and lateral position groups, respectively. Mean IJV flow was 1005.9+/-463 mL/min versus 634.7+/-245 mL/min (P=0.036) in Group S, 752.5+/-384.8 mL/min versus 672.3+/-391.0 mL/min (P=0.002) in group P, and 831.8+/-337.4 mL/min versus 514.4+/-305.3 mL/min (P<0.001) in group L at T0 and T2, respectively. Mean ONSD did not change between T1 and T2 in Groups S and P but increased in group L (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): Mean IJV flow decreased from baseline following the final neurosurgical positioning. Ultrasound-guided assessment of IJV flow could be a useful tool to quantify position-related changes in IJV drainage.Copyright © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Introduction: Symptomatic intracranial hypertension (IH) due to venous outflow obstruction secondary to dural venous sinus (DVS) tumoral invasion affects up to 3% of intracranial meningioma patients. The literature regarding endovascular therapies of such patients is limited to a few case reports and a recent single-centre case series. Purpose(s): We describe our single-centre experience of endovascular therapy in patients with clinically symptomatic IH secondary to DVS meningioma invasion. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of clinical and radiological data of all patients with refractory IH and meningiomas invading the DVS who were referred for possible DVS venoplasty and stenting. Seven endovascular procedures in six female patients were done. Presumed secondarily induced lateral transverse sinus stenosis was also stented in four patients as part of the primary intervention. Result(s): All patients experienced complete symptomatic resolution at 6-month follow-up. Five patients had no symptom recurrence over a mean follow-up period of 3.5 years. One patient with multiple meningiomas developed recurrent IH 2 years following stenting secondary to in-stent tumour re-invasion. This was re-stented with consequent 6 months post-retreatment symptomatic relief at the time of writing. No procedure-related complications occurred. Conclusion(s): In the setting of DVS stenosis secondary to meningioma invasion, endovascular therapy is a safe and successful therapeutic option with promising mid-term results. The procedure should be considered in cases where complete surgical tumour resection is unlikely or carries a significant risk. If present, secondarily induced stenoses at the lateral ends of the transverse sinuses should also be considered for treatment.Copyright © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

Abstract
  Objectives: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is frequently complicated by subacute subdural hematoma (SDH) and more rarely by bilateral thalamic ischemia. Here, we report a case of SIH-related SDH treated with three epidural patches (EPs), with follow-up of the intracranial pressure and lumbar intrathecal pressure. Method(s): A 46-year-old man presented bilateral thalamic ischemia, then a growing SDH. After failure of urgent surgical evacuation, he underwent three saline EPs, two dynamic myelography examinations and one digital subtraction angiography-phlebography examination. However, because of no dural tear and no obstacle to the venous drainage of the vein of Galen, no therapeutic procedure was available, and the patient died. Result(s): The case exhibited a progressive increase in the transmission of lumbar intrathecal pressure to intracranial pressure during the three EPs. The EPs may have successfully treated the SIH, but the patient did not recover consciousness because of irreversible damage to both thalami. Conclusion(s): Clinicians should be aware of the bilateral thalamic ischemia picture that may be the presenting sign of SIH. Moreover, the key problem in the pathophysiology of SIH seems to be intraspinal and intracranial volumes rather than pressures. Therefore, intracranial hypotension syndrome might actually be an intraspinal hypovolume syndrome.Copyright © 2024 Engrand, Salardaine, Desilles, Echard, Bourdillon, Williams and Baille.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: ERCP is an endoscopic procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of biliopancreatic system diseases. An increase in intra-abdominal pressure due to the insufflation of air to the intestinal lumen may be transmitted to ICP through the course of ERCP. In this prospective, randomized, controlled double-blinded study, we aimed to assess the ICP change using ultrasonography measurement of ONSD in patients undergoing ERCP comparing the effects of propofol and ketofol anesthesia. MATERIAL/METHODS: One hundred and nine patients undergoing ERCP under propofol or ketofol anesthesia were enrolled in the study. Ultrasonography measurement of ONSD was performed before (T0) and immediately after induction of anesthesia (T1), during sphincterotomy (T2), at the end of procedure (T3), and after the patient is fully awake (T4). RESULT(S): Comparison of ONSD values and ONSD alteration between groups showed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). Both groups showed significantly greater changes from T0 to T2 compared with values from T0 to T1, T3, and T4, respectively (P = 0,000). T0 to T3 alteration was also significantly greater than T0 to T1 and T4 change in both groups (P = 0,000). CONCLUSION(S): ERCP procedure increases intracranial pressure most prominently during sphincterotomy both under propofol or ketofol anesthesia. Further studies are needed to investigate the impact of this phenomenon on adverse clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2024 Copyright: © 2024 Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice.

Abstract
  Introduction: Due to less than favorable conditions in low and low-middle-income countries, surgeons have had to carefully craft improvised devices to try and mimic the functionality and level of innovation in the developed countries. In this review, we sought to examine the existing literature to review the alternative ways by which intracranial pressure is measured when standard devices are inaccessible. Furthermore, we aimed to see how these devices are made and how much they cost. Methodology: The PRISMA extension for scoping reviews was utilized. Databases and Grey Literature (PubMed, Google Scholar, and AJOL) were searched extensively, and papers reporting on the use of improvised intracranial pressure monitoring were included. The devices were grouped into two setups and described extensively. The cost of the devices was also estimated. We extracted the relevant information after identifying the papers that would be used in our review study. Result(s): 3 papers satisfied our eligibility criteria and were used in the review. Two setups were discussed. The first setup involved the use of a makeshift device made up of a size 6 feeding tube/soft silicon catheter, a central venous pressure manometer and sterile 0.9% saline as the coupling agent, while the second setup involved the use of a size 8 feeding tube, a pressure line extension, dome, transducer, and monitor. Both devices cost less than USD 20, a price far cheaper than the standard ICP devices quoted at about USD 800. Conclusion(s): Our review posits that these makeshift devices have certain advantages and may be useful in the rural and less developed parts of the world. It also serves as an area for intervention, especially in the context of global neurosurgery.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s)

Abstract
  Introduction: The mechanism of post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) hypoxemia involves ventilation/perfusion mismatch and loss of pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has been studied as an adjunct treatment to avoid the use of high positive end-expiratory pressure and inspired oxygen in treatment-refractory hypoxia. We hypothesized that iNO treatment following TBI would improve systemic and cerebral oxygenation via improved matching of pulmonary perfusion and ventilation. Method(s): Thirteen human patients with isolated TBI were enrolled and randomized to receive either placebo or iNO with measured outcomes including pulmonary parameters, blood gas data, and intracranial pressure (ICP) /perfusion. To complement this study, a porcine model of TBI (including 10 swine) was utilized with measured outcomes of brain tissue blood flow and oxygenation, ventilator parameters, and blood gas data both after administration and following drug removal and clearance. Result(s): There were no clinically significant changes in pulmonary parameters in either the human or porcine arm following administration of iNO when compared to either the placebo group (human arm) or the internal control (porcine arm). Analysis of pooled human data demonstrated the preservation of alveolar recruitment in TBI patients. There were no clinically significant changes in human ICP or cerebral perfusion pressure following iNO administration compared to controls. Conclusion(s): iNO had no significant effect on clinically relevant pulmonary parameters or ICPs following TBI in both human patients and a porcine model. The pressure-based recruitment of the human lungs following TBI was preserved. Further investigation will be needed to determine the degree of utility of iNO in the setting of hypoxia after polytrauma.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  Objective To summarize the imaging features of severe unilateral transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus thromboses, and evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravascular interventional therapy in them. Methods Thirty-seven patients with severe unilateral transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus thromboses clinically mainly manifested as intracranial hypertension and accepted endovascular intervention in Department of Interventional Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from June 2012 to September 2022 were chosen; their clinical data were retrospectively analyzed and imaging features were summarized. Short-term efficacy was evaluated according to blood flow restoration degrees and pressure gradient reduction in the occlusive sinus and modified neurological symptoms before and after endovascular intervention. Hospitalized complications were observed; safety and long-term efficacy were evaluated according to postoperative clinical follow-up and imaging results 6-12 months after endovascular intervention. Results (1) Preoperative brain MRI and (or) CT showed different degrees of swelling of the brain tissues, with the affected side as the target; mixed signals/density shadow could be seen in the blocked transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus; venous cerebral infarction or post-infarction cerebral hemorrhage could be combined in some patients. MRV, CTV and DSA showed poor or completely occluded transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus while normal in the contralateral side; obvious thrombus filling-defect was observed in the occluded venous sinus after mechanical thrombolysis. (2) Occlusive sinus blood flow was restored in all patients after endovascular intervention, and pressure gradient of the occlusive segment decreased from (16.6+/-3.3) mmHg before to (2.8+/-0.8) mmHg after endovascular intervention. Before discharge, clinical symptoms of all patients were significantly improved (modified Rankin scale [mRS] scores of 0 in 30 patients, 1 in 5 patients, 2 in 1 patient and 3 in 1 patient), and 2 patients had unilateral limb movement disorder (muscle strength grading III and IV, respectively). All patients received clinical follow-up for (9.6+/-3.0) months. At the last follow-up, neurological function obviously improved compared with that before endovascular intervention, without new neurosystem-related symptoms (mRS scores of 0 in 30 patients, 1 in 6, and 2 in 1 patient). In 34 patients received MRV or DSA follow-up, 28 had complete recanalization of occlusive sinus and 6 had partial recanalization, without obvious stenosis or recurrent occlusion. Conclusions Severe unilateral transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus thrombosis can cause local intracranial venous blood stasis, and then cause "increased regional venous sinus pressure", which is manifested as unilateral brain tissue swelling and even venous cerebral infarction or post-infarction cerebral hemorrhage. Early diagnosis and endovascular intervention can obviously improve the prognosis of these patients, enjoying good safety.Copyright © 2024 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

Abstract
  Background: Eagle jugular syndrome (EJS), recently identified as a cause of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) due to venous obstruction by an elongated styloid process (SP), is reported here alongside a case of concurrent de novo cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM). This study aims to explore the potential causal relationship between EJS and de novo CCM through a comprehensive literature review. Method(s): Systematic literature reviews, spanning from 1995 to 2023, focused on EJS cases with definitive signs and symptoms and de novo CCM cases with detailed clinical characteristics. Data on the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of EJS, as well as potential risk factors preceding de novo CCM, were collected to assess the relationship between the two conditions. Result(s): Among 14 patients from 11 articles on EJS, the most common presentation was increased intracranial hypertension (IIH), observed in 10 patients (71.4%), followed by dural sinus thrombosis in four patients (28.6%). In contrast, 30 patients from 28 articles were identified with de novo CCM, involving 37 lesions. In these cases, 13 patients developed CCM subsequent to developmental venous anomalies (43%), seven following dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) (23%), and two after sinus thrombosis (6%). In a specific case of de novo brainstem CCM, the development of an enlarged condylar emissary vein, indicative of venous congestion due to IJV compression by the elongated SP, was noted before the emergence of CCM. Conclusion(s): This study underscores that venous congestion, a primary result of symptomatic EJS, might lead to the development of de novo CCM. Thus, EJS could potentially be an indicator of CCM development. Further epidemiological and pathophysiological investigations focusing on venous circulation are necessary to clarify the causal relationship between EJS and CCM.Copyright © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

Abstract
  Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is broadly used in surgical wound management and more recently burn care; however, the tissue pressure changes and best dressing application technique remains unknown. This study was done to help understand the tissue pressure changes beneath negative pressure when varying the delivered pressures, dressing thickness and distribution of dressings. This study was done in 2021 at a quaternary paediatric burns hospital. Utilising a cadaveric porcine model, an intracranial pressure monitor and transducer were used to assess pressure. The transducer was placed on the epidermis or inserted under ultrasound guidance via cannulation to the dermis, subcutaneous or muscular layer. MepitelTM, ACTICOATTM, varying layers of KerlixTM (10, 20 or 30 layers) and NPWT were then applied either circumferentially or non-circumferentially. Each set of results is indicative of the intracranial pressure probe reading when NPWT was delivered at -40, -60, -80, -100 and -120 mmHg. The median and interquartile pressure recordings were epidermis: -42 (-42.5 - -41), -60.5 (-62.5 - -60), -80.5 (-82 - -80), - 99 (-99 - -98)mmHg (p < 0.001); dermis: 1 (0 - 2), 2 (1 - 3.5), 3 (2 - 5.5), 4 (3 - 7), 5.5 (4 - 7.5)mmHg (p < 0.001) (the increase in pressure was less when circumferential dressings (p < 0.001) or more layers of Kerlix were applied (p < 0.001)); subcutis: 1.5 (-4.5-1), -2.5 (-7.5 - 1.5), -3.5 (-11 - 1.5), -5 (-14 - 1.5) and -6 (-16 - 2)mmHg (p = 006) (the decrease in pressure was less with increased layers of Kerlix (0.047) and muscular: 0 (-0.5 - 0), 0 (-1 - 0.5), 0 (-1 - 1), 0 0 (-1 - 1), 00 (-1.5 - 1)mmHg (p = 0.55). These data suggest negative pressure paradoxically exerts a positive pressure on the dermis. Circumferential and multi-layer dressings reduce this positive pressure. This knowledge has impacted our burn negative pressure wound therapy dressing selection. The limitation of this study is the cadaveric model, a live model is suggested for future studies.Copyright © 2024

Abstract
  The current management approach for critically ill patients emphasizes maintaining adequate cardiac output and mean arterial pressure. Recently, researchers have increasingly emphasized the clinical significance of venous reflux. Bedside venous Doppler ultrasonography offers continuous, dynamic, and quantifiable assessment of the venous reflux status. In this review, we explore the pertinent literature on assessing the venous reflux status in critically ill patients. We propose a bedside ultrasonographic evaluation method that starts with the hepatic veins and progresses to the portal, renal and intrarenal, femoral, and pulmonary veins. The clinical significance of venous reflux status evaluation is discussed in terms of its effect on right ventricular function, the functioning of other organs, and the guidance of fluid therapy. Overall, we underscore the importance of venous reflux status evaluation in critically ill patients and highlight the benefits of incorporating bedside ultrasonography for the continuous monitoring of venous return.Copyright: © 2023 Zhao H. et al.

Abstract
  Background: Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disturbance in patients with neurological disease; however, its predictive role for outcome in patients with supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) is controversial. This study aims to explore the association between hyponatremia within 7 days after bleeding and 90-day mortality in patients with supratentorial sICH. Method(s): A retrospective analysis was conducted at our institution. Patients with sICH meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to determine the predictive value of hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mmol/L) for 90-day mortality and functional outcome. Subgroup analysis was performed based on the degree and duration of hyponatremia and therapeutic strategies. The Spearman correlation test was performed to explore the relationship between hyponatremia severity and duration with variables in a multivariate regression model. Kaplan-Meier curve was depicted to reveal the relationship between hyponatremia and mortality. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to show the diagnostic effect of the minimum concentration of serum sodium (sodiummin) on 90-day mortality. Result(s): A total of 960 patients were enrolled, 19.6% (188) of whom were patients with hyponatremia and 26.0% (250) had 90-day mortality. The incidence of hyponatremia was roughly 2.5 times in non-survivors compared with survivors (34.8% vs. 14.2%). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that hyponatremia was the independent predictor of 90-day mortality (OR 2.763, 95%CI 1.836-4.157) and adverse outcome (OR 3.579, 95%CI 2.332-6.780). Subgroup analysis indicated an increased trend in mortality risk with both duration (more or less than 48 h) and severity of hyponatremia (mild, moderate, and severe) and confirmed the predictive value of hyponatremia for mortality in patients undergoing surgical intervention (external ventricular drainage, craniotomy, and decompressive craniectomy; all p < 0.05). The Spearman correlation test indicated no moderate or strong relationship between hyponatremia severity and duration with other variables in the multivariate model (all rs < 0.4). The ROC curve suggested the moderate diagnostic performance of sodiummin for mortality in both general patients and subgroups of therapeutic method patients (AUC from 0.6475 to 0.7384). Conclusion(s): Hyponatremia occurring in the first 7 days after bleeding is an independent predictor of 90-day morality and adverse outcome. Rigorous electrolyte scrutiny in patients treated surgically is required.Copyright © 2024 Qian, Zheng, He, Zhou, Tang and Xing.

Abstract
  Traumatic brain injury is often associated with a direct or secondary neurovascular pathology. In this review, we present recent advancements in endovascular neurosurgery that enable accurate and effective vessel reconstruction with emphasis on its role in early diagnosis, the expanding use of flow diversion in pseudoaneurysms, and traumatic arteriovenous fistulas. In addition, future directions in which catheter-based interventions could potentially affect traumatic brain injury are described: targeting blood brain barrier integrity using the advantages of intra-arterial drug delivery of blood brain barrier stabilizers to prevent secondary brain edema, exploring the impact of endovascular venous access as a means to modulate venous outflow in an attempt to reduce intracranial pressure and augment brain perfusion, applying selective intra-arterial hypothermia as a neuroprotection method mitigating some of the risks conferred by systemic cooling, trans-vessel wall delivery of regenerative therapy agents, and shifting attention using multimodal neuromonitoring to post-traumatic vasospasm to further characterize the role it plays in secondary brain injury. Thus, we believe that the potential of endovascular tools can be expanded because they enable access to the "highways" governing perfusion and flow and call for further research focused on exploring these routes because it may contribute to novel endovascular approaches currently used for treating injured vessels, harnessing them for treatment of the injured brain.Copyright © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Abstract
  Background: Antiphospholipid syndrome is a complex autoimmune condition associated with the formation of recurrent thrombosis in any vascular bed throughout the body. Jugular vein thrombosis is very rare with only a 0.9% occurrence and is not typically associated with cerebrospinal rhinorrhea as a result of raised intracranial pressure. Case Description: A 54-year-old patient presented with a 9-month history of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea and headache on a background of antiphospholipid syndrome. Investigations showed a superior vena cava (SVC) and right internal jugular vein (IJV) obstruction with moderately elevated intracranial venous pressures. Her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain was consistent with a CSF leak. The patient underwent successful endovascular stenting of her obstructed SVC and right IJV followed by surgical repair of a herniating meningocele in the posterior left ethmoid air cells. Conclusion(s): CSF rhinorrhea is uncommon and never previously reported associated with SVC thrombosis induced by antiphospholipid syndrome. A combination of endovascular techniques and surgical repair is recommended for this challenging presentation.Copyright ©2024 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Surgical Neurology International.

Abstract
  Cerebral pial arteriovenous fistulas (pAVFs) are rare and complex high-flow vascular malformations found in pediatric and adolescent populations. 1 They are often divided into two groups based on the pattern of venous drainage, galenic or nongalenic. Nongalenic pAVFs are typically supratentorial and carry a high risk of rupture. Their angioarchitecture is very complex with various patterns of feeding arteries and draining veins not originating from dural vessels or the vein of Galen. 2 The natural history has not been well established; however, mortality estimates range as high 63%. 1 Presentations include hemorrhage, seizure, congestive heart failure, and elevated intracranial pressure. 3 We describe the case of an adolescent girl with acute onset of headaches that led to the discovery of an occipital, nongalenic pAVF. Transarterial and transvenous embolizations performed during a single procedure resulted in complete obliteration of the fistula. No complications arose, and the patient remained at her neurological baseline.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.
