TI Influence of PEEP on Cerebral Blood Flow and Cerebrovascular
   Autoregulation in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Background: High levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), as part of the treatment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), may prevent alveolar collapse and maintain oxygenation. PEEP potentially reduces cerebral venous return, increases intracranial blood volume, and may, therefore, affect cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular autoregulation (AR). This study investigates the effect of PEEP on CBF and AR in patients with respiratory failure.
   Methods: CBF velocity was measured using transcranial doppler and correlated with the invasive arterial blood pressure curve to calculate the index of AR Mx (Mx > 0.3 indicates impaired AR). Mx was measured at lower PEEP levels and after increasing PEEP. Only an increase of Mx of > 0.2 was considered to be clinically relevant. Two 1-sided Wilcoxon tests.
   Results: Twenty mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS were included. Elevation of PEEP from 9.2 +/- 1 to 14.3 +/- 1 cmH(2)O did not influence CBF velocity but increased Mx from 0.317 +/- 0.35 to 0.414 +/- 0.32 (difference <= 0.2). Mx was > 0.3 in 11/20 patients during baseline measurements, indicating impaired AR.
   Conclusions: Surprisingly, AR was impaired in 55% of the patients with ARDS. This should be taken into account when managing cerebral perfusion pressure to avoid cerebral hyperperfusion or hypoperfusion. Increasing PEEP from 9.2 to 14.3 cm H2O had no further clinically relevant effect on AR, independent of preexisting AR impairment.

AB This prospective randomized clinical study was designed to compare the effects of equal volumes of 7.5% hypertonic saline solution (HS) or 20% mannitol (M) on brain bulk and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) during elective neurosurgical procedures (aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or tumor). After informed consent, 50 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I (ASA I) patients were randomly assigned to M (n = 25) or HS (n = 25) groups. Anesthesia protocol was identical for both, and variables monitored included mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), central venous pressure(CVP), CSF pressure (CSFP), arterial blood gases (PaCO2 30-35 mm Hg), serum sodium, potassium, and osmolality, and diuresis. The study period started before hypertonic solution administration (To) and ended at the opening of the dura mater or 60 min after T-0. Data were assessed with repeated measures analysis of variance and Student t test with Bonferroni correction (p less than or equal to 0.05). MAP and CVP were the same in the two groups. After treatment, osmolality increased, and the increase at T-15 was higher in HS treated patients [316.6 +/- 9.3 vs. 304.0 +/- 12.0 (SD) mOsmol/kg; p < 0.001]. Sodium decreased after M and increased after HS. During the study, brain bulk was always considered satisfactory. CSFP was not different between M and I-IS groups and significantly decreased over time (p = 0.0056) with no difference between treatments. The results of the present study demonstrate that hypertonic saline is as effective as mannitol in reducing the brain bulk and the CSFP during elective neu rosurgical procedures under general anesthesia.

TI Oncologic Emergencies
SO AACN ADVANCED CRITICAL CARE
AB A new cancer diagnosis is expected to affect approximately 1.9 million people in the United States in 2021. A small percentage of these patients will experience an emergent cancer-related complication. Oncologic emergencies may be encountered in emergency departments or require intensive care management. Patients newly diagnosed with cancer are more likely to present with emergencies related to the underlying malignancies. Oncologic emergencies can have various manifestations, ranging from mechanical obstruction due to tumor growth to metabolic derangements due to abnormal secretions from the tumor. Therefore, early identification and treatment of life-threatening oncologic events is critical. Although there are several different types of oncologic emergencies, this article focuses on metabolic emergencies (tumor lysis syndrome and cytoreductive hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) and structural emergencies (increased intracranial pressure and vena cava thrombus). The purpose of this article is to provide acute care clinicians with an overview of selected oncologic emergencies and their evidence-based management.

TI Jugular venous oxygen saturation thresholds in trauma patients may not
   extrapolate to ischemic stroke patients - Lessons from a preliminary
   study
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB The authors' first examinations of 10 patients with severe hemispheric stroke indicate that bedside monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is of clinical value as a prognostic tool for outcome and as therapy of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Jugular venous oximetry, which is easier to handle and provides on-line data, may also be of prognostic value in patients with ischemic stroke, No clinical studies are available on patients with hemispheric infarctions. Therefore, in a second data analysis from the same patient population, the authors' objective was to estimate the clinical value of monitoring cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism with jugular bulb catheters in treatment of severe postischemic brain edema. In 10 patients with severe hemispheric infarctions, ICP, jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO(2)), CBF, and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO,) were measured prospectively. A total of 101 lCP1 SjV02, and 92 CBF measurements were obtained. Only two SjvO(2) values were below the critical thresholds to detect secondary ischemic events defined in trauma patients (SjvO(2) < 50%). Intracranial pressure elevations more than 20 mm Hg and pupillary disturbances were treated with osmotherapy (mannitol or hypertonic NaCl hydroxyethyl starch solution) or mild hyperventilation in combination with tromethamine-buffer. In 8 of 17 pairs of measurements with treated elevated ICP, CMRO2 varied and changes Of SjvO(2) did not reflect changes in CBF, Jugular bulb oximetry should interpreted with caution in patients with severe hemispheric infarction. Critical thresholds defined in trauma patients may not be extrapolated to ischemic stroke.

TI Techniques for pneumocephalus and brain shift reduction in DBS surgery:
   a review of the literature
SO NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW
AB Deep brain stimulation has become an established therapeutic choice to manage the symptoms of medically refractory Parkinson's disease. Its efficacy is highly dependent on the accuracy of electrodes' positioning in the correct anatomical target. During DBS procedure, the opening of the dura mater induces the displacement of neural structures. This effect mainly depends on the loss of the physiological negative intracranial pressure, air inflow, and loss of cerebrospinal fluid. Several studies concentrated on correcting surgical techniques for DBS electrodes' positioning in order to reduce pneumocephalus which may result in therapeutic failure. The authors focused in particular on reducing the brain air window and maintaining the pressure gradient between intra- and extracranial compartments. A significant reduction of pneumocephalus and brain shift was obtained by excluding the opening of the subarachnoid space, by covering the dura mater opening with tissue sealant and by reducing the intracranial pressure in general anesthesia. Smaller burr hole diameters were not statistically relevant for reducing air inflow and displacement of anatomical targets. The review of the literature showed that conserving a physiological intra-extracranial pressure gradient plays a fundamental role in avoiding pneumocephalus and consequent displacement of brain structures, which improves surgical accuracy and DBS long-term results.

TI Role of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance high-resolution variable
   flip angle turbo-spin-echo (T1 SPACE) technique in diagnosis of
   transverse sinus stenosis
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB Purpose: Transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) is the most sensitive imaging characteristic of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance high-resolution variable flip angle turbo-spin-echo (T1 SPACE) technique in TSS patients and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of enhanced T1 SPACE, and phase-contrast magnetic resonance venography (PC MRV) with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as standard imaging.
   Method: This prospective study enrolled 62 patients with suspected IIH and PC MRV-confirmed transverse sinus stenosis. All patients underwent lumbar puncture, PC MRV, enhanced T1 SPACE sequences and DSA examination. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of enhanced T1 SPACE in detecting venous sinus stenosis were calculated and compared with those of PC MRV. Intermodality agreement (Kendall's rank correlation coefficients and weighted kappa statistic) was assessed.
   Results: Sixty-two patients were enrolled from November 2016 to October 2018. For the measured stenosis, better correlation was observed in enhanced T1 SPACE and DSA (AUC= 0.953) than PC MRV (AUC= 0.871). Intermodality agreement of enhanced T1 SPACE (r(k)= 0.895 and weighted kappa= 0.868) was better than PC MRV (r(k)= 0.753 and weighted kappa = 0.653) compared with DSA. Thirty-seven intrasinus filling defects were detected by contrast-enhanced T1 SPACE, while only twenty of them were detected on source imaging of PC MRV.
   Conclusions: The contrast-enhanced T1 SPACE sequence was more sensitive and specific compared with PC MRV in assessing stenosis and detecting lesions in TSS patients. Accurate determination of the presence and extent of TSS using this technique might be useful in patient selection and guiding the treatment.

TI Pathogenetic Mechanisms of Neurogenic Pulmonary Edema
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is a life-threatening complication of central nervous system (CNS) injuries. This review summarizes current knowledge about NPE etiology and pathophysiology with an emphasis on its experimental models, including our spinal cord compression model. NPE may develop as a result of activation of specific CNS trigger zones located in the brainstem, leading to a rapid sympathetic discharge, rise in systemic blood pressure, baroreflex-induced bradycardia, and enhanced venous return resulting in pulmonary vascular congestion characterized by interstitial edema, intra-alveolar accumulation of transudate, and intra-alveolar hemorrhages. The potential etiological role of neurotransmitter changes in NPE trigger zones leading to enhanced sympathetic nerve activity is discussed. Degree of anesthesia is a crucial determinant for the extent of NPE development in experimental models because of its influence on sympathetic nervous system activity. Sympathetic hyperactivity is based on the major activation of either ascending spinal pathways by spinal cord injury or NPE trigger zones by increased intracranial pressure. Attenuation of sympathetic nerve activity or abolition of reflex bradycardia completely prevent NPE development in our experimental model. Suggestions for future research into NPE pathogenesis as well as therapeutic potential of particular drugs and interventions are discussed.

TI Reversible ventriculoperitoneal shunt dysfunction and chronic
   constipation: case report
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB Constipation can cause transient malfunction of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS). Patients with myelomeningocele or cerebral palsy are often diagnosed with hydrocephalus and constipation due to neurogenic bowel.These patients are more prone to VPS dysfunction, often requiring surgical revision. The authors report the case of a 6-year-old girl with a VPS that had been implanted due to hydrocephalus secondary to myelomeningocele. The patient was brought to the emergency department with intermittent headache, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distension and pain. A CT scan revealed ventricular dilatation and radiography of the abdomen showed bowel loop distension. After a Fleet enema and digital maneuvers, her abdominal distension and symptoms improved. A CT scan obtained 24 hours later showed a reduction in ventricular size. The mechanism by which constipation can lead to VPS malfunction can be traced to indirect increases of intraabdominal pressure and direct obstruction of the catheter by distended intestinal loops. Treating constipation can restore the free circulation of the CSF and avoid surgical intervention. Careful neurological monitoring of these patients is essential, because some measures used to treat constipation can increase intracranial pressure. The objective of this report was to highlight constipation as a possible cause of transient VPS malfunction, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgical revisions, to which children with hydrocephalus are frequently submitted.

TI IMPORTANCE OF ANTI-SIPHON DEVICES IN THE TREATMENT OF PEDIATRIC
   HYDROCEPHALUS
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB The effects of an antisiphon device (ASD) on shunt flow and intracranial pressure (ICP) in 16 children with hypertensive hydrocephalus were examined using quantitative radionuclide shuntography (Tc-99m) with the children in supine and sitting positions. The average age of these patients was 9.5 years. Results were compared with those recorded in 36 patients with adult normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The closing pressure levels of shunt valve used were low in 8 cases, medium in 7 and high in 1. Half the children (8) had shunt systems with, and the other 8 without, ASD. In the children who had the shunt system without ASD, sitting shunt flow was significantly greater than supine shunt flow, which indicated overdrainage. Conversely, in children who had the shunt system with ASD, supine shunt flow was greater than sitting shunt flow. Because ASD prevented overdrainage, ICP was higher with the shunt system with ASD than with the shunt system without ASD. Without ASD, sitting shunt flow of children was lower than that of adult patients with NPH because of the lower hydrostatic pressure, which correlated with their height. Conversely, in the presence of a shunt system with ASD, sitting shunt flow of children was greater than that of adults, because of the higher ICP and lower hydrostatic pressure. The effect of ASD was smaller in children than in adults, because positive pressure over the ASD was greater (hypertension vs normal pressure) and negative pressure under the ASD was less (short vs tall) in children than in adults. Thus, in children the ASD was effective in preventing overdrainage. An overfunction of the ASD, which has sometimes been observed in adult patients with NPH, was not encountered. The relationships among the function of the ASD and ICP, height and position of the ASD are discussed.

TI Intracranial effects of endotracheal suctioning in the acute phase of
   head injury
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB In patients with head injury, endotracheal suctioning (ETS) is it potentially dangerous procedure, because it can increase intracranial pressure (ICP). The purpose of this prospective nonrandomized study was to evaluate the impact of ETS oil intracranial dynamics in the acute phase of head injury. Seventeen patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Score less than or equal to 8, range 4-8), sedated and mechanically ventilated, Were studied during the first week after trauma. Single-pass ETS maneuver (with it 16-French catheter, negative pressure of 100 mm fig, and duration of less than 30 seconds) was performed 60 seconds after the FiO(2) was increased to 100%. After ETS, FiO(2) was maintained at 100% for another 30 seconds. Before and after ETS, arterial blood gases and jugular oxygen saturation (SA), ICP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated, A total of 131 ETS episodes, which consisted of repeated assessment of each patient. were analyzed. Six patients in 20 cases coughed and/or moved during ETS because of inadequate sedation, After ETS, ICP increased from 20 +/- 12 to 22 +/- 13 mm fig in well-sedated patients and from 15 +/- 9 to 28 +/- 9 mm fig in patients who coughed and/or moved (mean change, 2 +/- 6 versus 13 +/- 6 mm fig, P < .0001). CPP and SjO2 increased in well-sedated patients (from 78 +/- 16 to 83 +/- 19 mm Hg, and from 71 +/- 10 to 73 +/- 13%. respectively) and decreased in patients who reacted to ETS (from 79 +/- 14 to 72 +/- 14 mm fig and from 69 +/- 7 to 66 +/- 9%, respectively), and the differences were significant (mean change, CPP: 5 +/- 14 versus -7 +/- 15 mm Hg, P = .003; (SjO2) 2 +/- 5 vs. -3 +/- 5%, P < .0001). In well-sedated patients, endotracheal suctioning caused an increase in ICP, CPP, and Sio, without evidence of ischemia. In contrast, in patients who coughed or moved in response to suctioning, there was a slight and significant decrease in CPP and SjO2. In the case of patients with head injuries who coughed or moved during endotracheal suctioning, we strongly suggest deepening the level of sedation before completing the procedure to reduce the risk of adverse effects.

TI Volume reduction of the jugular foramina in Cavalier King Charles
   Spaniels with syringomyelia
SO BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Background: Understanding the pathogenesis of the chiari-like malformation in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) is incomplete, and current hypotheses do not fully explain the development of syringomyelia (SM) in the spinal cords of affected dogs. This study investigates an unconventional pathogenetic theory for the development of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure waves in the subarachnoid space in CKCS with SM, by analogy with human diseases. In children with achondroplasia the shortening of the skull base can lead to a narrowing of the jugular foramina (JF) between the cranial base synchondroses. This in turn has been reported to cause a congestion of the major venous outflow tracts of the skull and consequently to an increase in the intracranial pressure (ICP). Amongst brachycephalic dog breeds the CKCS has been identified as having an extremely short and wide braincase. A stenosis of the JF and a consequential vascular compromise in this opening could contribute to venous hypertension, raising ICP and causing CSF jets in the spinal subarachnoid space of the CKCS. In this study, JF volumes in CKCSs with and without SM were compared to assess a possible role of this pathologic mechanism in the development of SM in this breed.
   Results: Computed tomography (CT) scans of 40 CKCSs > 4 years of age were used to create three-dimensional (3D) models of the skull and the JF. Weight matched groups (7-10 kg) of 20 CKCSs with SM and 20 CKCSs without SM were compared. CKCSs without SM presented significantly larger JF volumes (median left JF: 0.0633 cm(3); median right JF: 0.0703 cm(3); p < 0.0001) when compared with CKCSs with SM (median left JF: 0.0382 cm(3); median right JF: 0.0434 cm(3); p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the left and right JF within each group. Bland-Altman analysis revealed excellent reproducibility of all volume measurements.
   Conclusion: A stenosis of the JF and consecutive venous congestion may explain the aetiology of CSF pressure waves in the subarachnoid space, independent of cerebellar herniation, as an additional pathogenetic factor for the development of SM in this breed.

TI Endovascular Recanalization of Occluded Dural Sinus in Patient with
   Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas: Case Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Symptomatic sinus occlusion complicated with dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) can be treated successfully endovascularly. However, no studies have reported the use of endovascular transvenous approaches alone to recanalize the occluded sinuses for treatment of the involved dAVFs without stent deployment. In this study, we presented a 75-year-old man with occlusion of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses complicated with a dAVF.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This patient initially suffered intermittent headache, nausea, and vomiting but developed seizures and hemiplegic paralysis 2 months later. Neurologic examination revealed mildly decreased motor function in grade IV in the left limb. Intracranial pressure by lumbar puncture was 300 mm H2O. Magnetic resonance imaging venography disclosed sinus occlusion and dAVFs accounting for encephaledema. Cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses and cortical reflux with the sinus junction unobstructed. The feeding arteries of the left transverse sinus dAVFs were muscular branches of the left vertebral artery and external carotid artery, and the draining vein was from the superior sagittal sinus to the contralateral transverse sinus. Balloon angioplasty plus mechanical cracking (pulling a microcatheter back and forth) was used to recanalize the occluded sinuses. The symptoms disappeared after endovascular recanalization of the occluded left transverse sinus and sigmoid sinuses, and follow-up venography revealed opened sinuses with complete disappearance of the dAVF.
   CONCLUSION: Endovascular transvenous recanalization may be a better alternative therapy for selected patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas complicated by sinus occlusion without stent deployment.

TI CHANGES OF DEEP CERVICAL LYMPH-FLOW FOLLOWING THE INFUSION OF ISOTONIC,
   HYPOTONIC, AND HYPERTONIC NACL IN RABBIT
SO LIFE SCIENCES
AB Isotonic, hypotonic, or hypertonic saline was infused in anesthetized rabbits in order to test the effects of osmolality in cerebral vessels on lymph flow.  The jugular lymph trunk was cannulated by PE tubing in a headward direction.  Either a hypo-(100 mosmol), iso-(310 mosmol), or hypertonic (605 mosmol) NaCl solution was infused into the internal carotid artery (ICA) or the right lateral ventricle (RIV).  Lymph was continuously collected at slight negative pressure, and measured over a 90 min preinfusion period, as well as during saline infusion and intermittent recovery periods.  Mean peak flow rates for the first 30 min infusion of hypertonic saline via ICA and RLV were 5.1 +/- 1.2 and 6.7 +/- 1.6 ul/min, respectively, or a significant increase of 38% and 40% over those of isotonic saline (3.7 +/- 0.9 ul/min via ICA; 4.8 +/- 1.0 ul/min via RLV).  Conversely, for hypotonic saline, lymph flow rates were significantly reduced by 19% (2.9 +/- 0.6 ul/min) and 23% (3.7 +/- 0.7 ul/min) for the first 30 min infusion via ICA and RLV, respectively.  Increases in arterial and intracranial pressures, as well as an enhancement of respiratory movements following hypertonic saline infusion, augmented lymph formation.  The results suggest that the observed changes in jugular lymph flow following saline infusion can be correlated to the resulting increase in intracranial pressure and respiratory movements, and changes in the osmolality and blood pressure of cerebral vessels.

TI Cerebrovascular resuscitation after polytrauma and fluid restriction
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
CT 92nd Annual Clinical Congress of the American-College-of-Surgeons
CY OCT 08-12, 2006
CL Chicago, IL
SP Amer Coll Surg
AB BACKGROUND: There are few reproducible models of blast injury, so it is difficult to evaluate new or existing therapies. We developed a clinically relevant polytrauma model to test the hypothesis that cerebrovascular resuscitation is optimized when intravenous fluid is restricted.
   STUDY DESIGN: Anesthetized swine (42 +/- 5 kg, n = 35) received blasts to the head and bilateral chests with captive bolt guns, followed by hypoventilation (4 breaths/min; FiO(2) = 0.21). After 30 minutes, resuscitation was divided into phases to simulate typical prehospital, emergency room, and ICU care. For 30 to 45 minutes, group 1, the control group (n = 5), received 1 L of normal saline (NS). For 45 to 120 minutes additional NS was titrated to mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg. After 120 minutes, mannitol (1g/kg) and phenylephrine were administered to manage cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) > 70 mmHg, plus additional NS was given to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) > 12 mmHg. In group 2 (n = 5), MAP and CPP targets were the same, but the CVP target was > 8 mmHg. Group 3 (n = 5) received 1 L of NS followed only by CPP management. Group 4 (n = 5) received Hextend (Abbott Laboratories), instead of NS, to the same MAP and CPP targets as group 2.
   RESULTS: Polytrauma caused 13 deaths in the 35 animals. In survivors, at 30 minutes, MAP was 60 to 65 mmHg, heart rate was > 100 beats/min, PaO2 was < 50 mmHg, and lactate was > 5 mmol/L. In two experiments, no fluid or pressor was administered; the tachycardia and hypotension persisted. The first liter of intravenous fluid partially corrected these variables, and also partially corrected mixed venous O-2, gastric and portal venous O-2, cardiac output, renal blood flow, and urine output. Additional NS (total of 36 +/- 1 mL/kg/h and 17 6 mL/kg/h, in groups 1 and 2, respectively) correlated with increased intracranial pressure to 38 4 mmHg (group 1) and 26 +/- 4 mmHg (group 2) versus 22 +/- 4 mmHg in group 3 (who received 5 +/- 1 mL/kg/h). CPP was maintained only after mannitol and phenylephrine. By 5 hours, brain tissue PO2 was > 20 mmHg in groups 1 and 2, but only 6 +/- 1 mmHg in group 3. In contrast, minimal Hextend (6 3 mL/kg/h) was needed; the corrections in MAP and CPP were immediate and sustained, intracranial pressure was lower (14 +/- 2 mmHg), and brain tissue PO2 was > 20 mmHg. Neuropathologic changes were consistent with traumatic brain injury, but there were no statistically significant differences between groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: After polytrauma and resuscitation to standard MAP and CPP targets with mannitol and pressor therapy, we concluded that intracranial hypertension was attenuated and brain oxygenation was maintained with intravenous fluid restriction; cerebrovascular resuscitation was optimized with Hextend versus NS; and longer term studies are needed to determine neuropathologic consequences.

TI Transverse sinus dural fistula: Combined surgical and endovascular
   approach: A case report
SO SURGICAL NEUROLOGY
AB BACKGROUND The treatment of a large dural sinus fistula can be very difficult and complicated. The very extensive and complex nature of these malformations may require a combination therapy in the form of surgery and multistaged embolization. The transverse sinus fistula in our patient was fed by multiple large high-flow feeders and was draining retrograde into the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the cortical veins. The SSS did not fill in the late venous phase of the carotid angiogram, suggesting increased venous pressure.
   METHODS A case of transverse sinus dural fistula is described that was managed by a combination of surgery and embolization. The complex nature of this malformation encouraged us to adopt a combination of multistaged embolization and surgery for the management and clinical control. The patient underwent embolization of multiple feeders from the branches of the external carotid artery. After this procedure, the patient underwent endovascular occlusion of the transverse sinus via the SSS. Throughout the endovascular treatment, the patient had concomitant intracranial pressure monitoring and SSS pressure monitoring, along with transcranial cerebral oximetry (TCCO). Despite this aggressive endovascular intervention, the fistula could not be completely closed. The patient then underwent surgical excision of the transverse sinus along with duraplasty and cranioplasty.
   RESULTS The patient had a good recovery and posttreatment angiogram revealed normal antegrade flow in the SSS with no evidence of the fistula. The combined surgical and endovascular techniques are described and their use in clinical practice is discussed.
   CONCLUSIONS The complexity of certain large dural sinus fistulae should not be underestimated. They may require a prolonged multistaged treatment for their total obliteration. Also, despite the large size and complexity of the disease, complete cure can be achieved.

TI Spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome: proposed pathogenesis,
   terrestrial analogues, and emerging countermeasures
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) refers to a distinct constellation of ocular, neurological and neuroimaging findings observed in astronauts during and following long duration spaceflight. These ocular findings, to include optic disc oedema, posterior globe flattening, chorioretinal folds and hyperopic shifts, were first described by NASA in 2011. SANS is a potential risk to astronaut health and will likely require mitigation prior to planetary travel with prolonged exposures to microgravity. While the exact pathogenesis of SANS is not completely understood, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this neuro-ocular phenomenon. In this paper, we briefly discuss the current hypotheses and contributing factors underlying SANS pathophysiology as well as analogues used to study SANS on Earth. We also review emerging potential countermeasures for SANS including lower body negative pressure, nutritional supplementation and translaminar pressure gradient modulation. Ongoing investigation within these fields will likely be instrumental in preparing and protecting astronaut vision for future spaceflight missions including deep space exploration.

TI Comparison of hemodynamic and respiratory effect during laparoscopic
   cholecystectomy using CO2 or laparolift.
SO ANNALES DE CHIRURGIE
AB This study compares the cardio-respiratory effects of CO2 pneumoperitoneum to those of abdominal suspension (or laparolift) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Between september 1993 et may 1995, 31 patients participated in this nonrandomized prospective trial. They consisted of 9 males et 22 females, with a mean age of 47,0 +/- 14 years. Sixteen patients were included in the CO2 group and 15 in the laparolift group. Both groups were comparable for age and gender. All patients were submitted to the same anaesthetic protocol. Repeated measurements of the respiratory and cardiovascular function were made during the intervention. End tidal CO2, minute ventilation, peak inspiratory pressure showed superior elevations in the CO2 group. And for the hemodynamic parameters, only the mean arterial pressure and cardiac frequency differed between the two groups, other hemodynamic parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction were comparable. Also, postoperatory hospital stay, OR time, per and postoperatory complications were comparable. With its stable hemodynamic and ventilatory pattern, abdominal suspension can constitute a safe and secure alternative to CO2 pneumoperitoneum in patients with respiratory dysfonction.

TI Relentless pulsatile tinnitus secondary to dural sinovenous stenosis: is
   endovascular sinus stenting the answer?
SO CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
AB AIM: To assess the efficacy of endovascular venous sinus stenting (EVSS) in treating pulsatile tinnitus (PT) caused by dural venous sinus stenosis (DVSS), and to determine whether it is an adequate remedy in cases with concurrent venous anomalies.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients (13 female and four male) with PT due to DVSS were treated using EVSS. The trans-stenotic pressure gradient (PG) was measured before and after stenting. The effect of stenting on the tinnitus was evaluated by questioning the patients at day 0, and at 3, 6, and 9 months after stenting.
   RESULTS: Except for one patient who continued to complain of PT, all of the patients, including two with concomitant sinus diverticula, described complete resolution of the tinnitus immediately following stenting. The post-stenting PG was significantly lower than the pre-stenting PG (p<0.0001). No procedure related complications occurred and no recurrence was recorded during the follow-up period.
   CONCLUSION: EVSS is a safe and successful treatment for PT due to DVSS even in cases with coexistent sinus diverticula. (C) 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Cerebral Blood-Flow Regulation During Hemorrhage
SO COMPREHENSIVE PHYSIOLOGY
AB Massive uncontrolled blood loss can occur under a variety of conditions including trauma, as a complication of childbirth or surgery, ruptured ulcers, clotting disorders, and hemorrhagic fevers. Across the continuum of hemorrhage, loss of blood volume is a significant challenge to the maintenance of cerebral perfusion. During the initial stages of hemorrhage, reflex mechanisms are activated to protect cerebral perfusion, but persistent blood loss will eventually reduce global cerebral blood flow and the delivery of metabolic substrates, leading to generalized cerebral ischemia, hypoxia, and ultimately, neuronal cell death. Cerebral blood flow is controlled by various regulatory mechanisms, including prevailing arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, arterial blood gases, neural activity, and metabolic demand. Hemorrhage represents a unique physiological stress to the brain, as it influences each of these regulatory mechanisms, resulting in complex interplay that ultimately challenges the ability of the brain to maintain adequate perfusion. Early studies of actual hemorrhage in humans employed blood loss protocols up to 1000 mL, but did not include any measurements of cerebral blood flow. As ethical considerations necessarily constrain the use of human volunteers for massive blood loss studies that induce irreversible shock, most of what is known about cerebral blood-flow responses to hemorrhage has been determined from animal models. Limitations of species differences regarding regulatory mechanisms, anatomy, and the effect of anesthesia, however, must be considered. Advances in monitoring technologies, and a recent renewed interest in understanding cerebral blood-flow regulation in humans, however, is rapidly accelerating knowledge in this field.

AB Introduction: Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are increasingly recognised to be a contributing cause of organ dysfunction and mortality in critically ill patients. The number of publications describing and researching this phenomenon is increasing exponentially but there are still very limited data about treatment and outcome.
   Methods: This review will focus on the available literature from the last years. A Medtine and PubMed search was performed using the search terms "abdominal compartment syndrome" and "treatment".
   Results: This search yielded 437 references, most of which were not relevant to the subject of this paper. The remaining abstracts were screened and selected on the basis of relevance, methodology and number of cases. Full text articles of the selected abstracts were used to supplement the authors' expert opinion and experience. The abdomino-thoracic transmission of pressure has direct clinical consequences on the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems in terms of monitoring and management. These interactions are discussed and treatment recommendations are made. IAH-induced renal dysfunction is addressed as a separate issue. Finally, an overview of non-invasive measures to decrease IAP is given.
   Conclusion: This paper describes current insights on management of IAP induced organ dysfunction and lists the most widely used and published non-invasive techniques to decrease IAP with their limitations and pitfalls.

AB The mechanism of brain contusion is investigated using a finite element analysis. Prior to the numerical calculation for a finite element human head model, the experimental study of an impact loading for a water-filled acrylic cylindrical container was carried out in order to observe the fundamental physical phenomenon and to confirm the validity of the finite element analysis in comparison with the both numerical and experimental results. After the stroke, the deflection of the acrylic container wall propagated in both sides of the stroke point, and large negative pressure was generated just in the opposite side of the stroke point when deflections from both sides met. The time taken until the deflection reached the opposite side was close to the natural period of the water-filled container and the period of fluctuation of internal pressure was equal to the natural frequency of the water-filled container. In numerical analysis the amplitude of the pressure fluctuation was slightly bigger for the tied container wall-water interface condition than for slide condition, and the damping was slightly bigger for the slide condition than for the tied condition, although the numerical and experimental pressure responses resembled each other approximately. Next, the human head model was analysed by FEM and the result was compared with the result of the experimental study reported by Nahum and good agreement was obtained. Five more loading cases were investigated. The deflection of the skull gave a large effect on the fluctuation of the internal pressure also for both coup and conrecoup contusions. Although in the frontal, occipital and under occipital region strokes the intracranial pressure of the coup and the contrecoup side was almost the same, in the parietal and temporal region strokes the intracranial pressure in the coup side was bigger than the contrecoup side.

TI Giant Pediatric Dural Arteriovenous Fistula Management Using a Combined
   Operative Approach in a Hybrid Neuroendovascular Surgery Suite:
   Technical Nuances and Review of Literature
SO OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) are rare, complex entities usually presenting with macrocephaly from increased intracranial pressures at a young age. In the setting of a symptomatic intracranial dAVF that has undergone multiple endovascular treatments with subsequent recurrence or failed embolization attempts, the intracranial venous system can become inaccessible by traditional transvenous and transarterial routes. Direct puncture of the venous sinus for endovascular access after surgical exposure is a viable option.OBJECTIVE:To describe the technical nuances and available literature for direct puncture of the venous sinus for endovascular access in a pediatric patient with dAVF.
   METHODS: The clinical characteristics were reviewed and reported for a patient who underwent direct puncture of the venous sinus for endovascular access. In addition, a literature review was conducted for relevant literature pertaining to this technique and its associated indications, outcomes, and complications.
   RESULTS: Only 2 other reports of direct puncture of venous sinus for endovascular access after surgical exposure were found in the literature. Our patient achieved a favorable outcome with complete dAVF obliteration.
   CONCLUSION: Direct puncture of the venous sinus for endovascular access after surgical exposure for complex dAVFs that are inaccessible by transvenous or transarterial routes is a practical and safe approach to intracranial venous access that should be part of the vascular neurosurgeon's arsenal.

TI Insights on the Hydrodynamics of Chiari Malformation
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB Background: We propose that the appearance of a ptosis of the cerebellar tonsils and syringomyelia is linked to its own hemohydrodynamic mechanisms. We aimed to quantify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cerebral blood flow to highlight how neurofluid is affected by Chiari malformations type 1(CMI) and its surgery. Methods: We retrospectively included 21 adult patients with CMI who underwent pre- and postoperative phase contrast MRI (PCMRI) during the period from 2001 to 2017. We analyzed intraventricular CSF, subarachnoid spaces CSF, blood, and tonsils pulsatilities. Results: In preoperative period, jugular venous drainage seems to be less preponderant in patients with syringomyelia than other patients (venous correction factor: 1.49 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.19 +/- 0.1, p = 0.05). After surgery, tonsils pulsatility decreased significantly (323 +/- 175 mu L/cardiac cycle (CC) vs. 194 +/- 130 mu L/CC, p = 0.008) and subarachnoid CSF pulsatility at the foramen magnum increased significantly (201 +/- 124 mu L/CC vs. 363 +/- 231 mu L/CC, p = 0.02). After surgery, we found a decrease in venous flow amplitude (5578 +/- 2469 mm(3)/s vs. 4576 +/- 2084 mm(3)/s, p = 0.008) and venous correction factor (1.98 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.20 +/- 0.3 mm(3)/s, p = 0.004). Conclusions: Phase-contrast MRI could be a useful additional tool for postoperative evaluation and follow-up, and is complementary to morphological imaging.

TI The Genesis of Low Pressure Hydrocephalus
SO NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB Low pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is an uncommon entity. Recognition of this treatable condition is important when clinicians are faced with the paradox of symptomatic hydrocephalus despite low intracranial pressures (ICP). Its etiology remains enigmatic.
   We identified patients with LPH from the prospective, inpatient neuro-intensive care database over a 4-year period (2006-2010).
   Nine patients with LPH were identified over a 4-year period. The time from diagnosis of the initial neurosurgical condition to development of LPH varied from 7 days to 5 years. The sub-zero drainage method of Pang and Altschuler was successful in all cases. LPH was accompanied by transependymal edema in five patients despite low ICP. Four patients developed LPH during their initial admission for intracranial bleeding. As patients entered the LPH state, the ICP remained in a normal range yet daily CSF output from the external ventricular drain was reduced. When LPH patients were drained at sub-zero levels, daily CSF output exceeded baseline values for several days and then receded to baseline. Long-term management was achieved with low pressure shunt systems: six programmable shunts; one valveless ventriculoperitoneal shunt; two ventriculopleural shunts. Conditions most commonly associated with LPH are: subarachnoid hemorrhage, chronic hydrocephalus, brain tumors, and chronic CNS infections.
   Low pressure hydrocephalus is a challenging diagnosis. The genesis of LPH was associated with a drop in EVD output, symptomatic ventriculomegaly, and a remarkable absence of intracranial hypertension. When LPH was treated with the sub-zero method, a 'diuresis' of CSF ensued. These observations support a Darcy's flux of brain interstitial fluid due to altered brain poroelastance; in simpler terms, a boggy brain state.

TI Dural arteriovenous fistula of the torcular herophili presenting with
   hydrocephalus and venous congestion in an 8-month-old child: A case
   report
SO BRAIN CIRCULATION
AB Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are direct communication between the dural arterial and venous systems. They are more common in adults. In children, they are relatively rare. Hydrocephalus is a common problem in pediatrics with a variety of causes. However, very few cases of hydrocephalus as a complication of DAVF have been reported in the literature. This case describes an 8-month-old male child with a large DAVF at the torcular herophili who presented with regression of milestones and hydrocephalus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on admission showed triventricular hydrocephalus and a massively dilated torcular with a compressed fourth ventricle. Angiography confirmed the presence of a DAVF at the torcula with arterial feeders from the posterior circulation. Endovascular embolization was performed with >80% embolization of the fistula with no complications. Control MRI immediately postoperative was acceptable. No cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion was performed. At a 3-month follow-up, the child had attained all developmental milestones for age. MRI showed normal CSF dynamics and a further reduction in the size of the torcula. Despite being rare, DAVFs should be considered as a possible cause of pediatric hydrocephalus, and treating them can lead to a resolution of the mechanisms inducing hydrocephalus. CSF shunting should be reserved for those cases with persistent hydrocephalus and raised intracranial pressure despite endovascular treatment.

TI A comparison of the pathophysiologic effects of carbon dioxide, nitrous
   oxide, and helium pneumoperitoneum on intracranial pressure
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that diagnostic laparoscopy may be contraindicated in multiple trauma patients with closed head injuries because of the detrimental effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneum on intracranial pressure (ICP). In this study we compared the effects of two alternative inflation gases, helium (He) and nitrous oxide (N2O), against the standard agent used in most hospitals, CO2. ICP was monitored in experimental animals both with and without a space occupying intracranial lesion designed to simulate a closed head injury.
   METHODS: Twenty-four domestic pigs (mean, 30 kg) were divided into four groups (6 CO2, 6 He, 6 N2O, and 6 control animals without insufflation). All animals were monitored for ICP, intraabdominal pressure, mean arterial pressure, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO(2)), and arterial blood gases. These parameters were measured for 30 minutes prior to introducing a pneumoperitoneum and then for 80 minutes thereafter. The measurements were repeated after artificially elevating the ICP with a balloon placed in the epidural space.
   RESULTS: The mean ICP increased significantly in all groups during peritoneal insufflation compared with the control group (P <0.005). The CO2-insufflated animals also showed a significant increase in PaCO2 (P <0.05) and ETCO(2) (P <0.05), as well as a decrease in pH (P <0.05). After inflating the epidural balloon the ICP remained significantly higher in animals inflated with CO2 as compared with the He and N2O groups (P <0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Peritoneal insufflation with He and N2O resulted in a significantly less increase in ICP as compared with CO2. That difference was most likely due to a metabolically mediated increase in cerebral perfusion (PaCO2) in the CO2 group. Further studies need to be conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of using He and N2O as inflation agents prior to attempting diagnostic or therapeutic laparoscopy in patients with potential closed head injuries.

TI Association of Exercise and Swimming Goggles With Modulation of
   Cerebro-ocular Hemodynamics and Pressures in a Model of
   Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome
SO JAMA OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB ImportanceAstronauts on International Space Station missions demonstrate adverse neuro-ocular changes. Reversing a negative translaminar pressure gradient (TLPG) by modulating cerebral blood flow, decreasing intracranial pressure, or increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) has been proposed as potential intervention for spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). ObjectiveTo examine whether exercise (resistance, moderate-intensity aerobic, and high-intensity aerobic) or artificially increasing IOP is associated with modulated cerebro-ocular hemodynamic and pressure changes during head-down tilt (HDT), an analogue of spaceflight, in healthy adults. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA single-center investigation was conducted at Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, in 20 healthy men. ExposureOn 3 separate days, participants rested supine, were tilted to -15 degrees HDT, and then completed 1 of 3 experimental exercise conditions (moderate-intensity aerobic, resistance, or high-intensity interval aerobic). A subset of 10 participants wore swimming goggles on all days. Main Outcomes and MeasuresApplanation rebound tonometry was used to noninvasively assess IOP, and compression sonography was used to assess internal jugular venous pressure (IJVP). Estimated TLPG was calculated as the difference between IOP and IJVP. Cerebral inflow and outflow were measured in extracranial arteries using color-coded duplex ultrasonography. ResultsTwenty men participated in the study (mean [SD] age, 36 [9] years). Compared with supine IOP (mean [SD], 19.3 [3.7] mm Hg), IJVP (mean [SD], 21.4 [6.0] mm Hg), and estimated TLPG (mean [SD], -2.1 [7.0] mm Hg), -15 degrees HDT was associated with increased IOP (mean difference, 2.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.4-3.3 mm Hg; P<.001) and IJVP (mean difference, 10.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, 8.9-12.2 mm Hg; P<.001) and with decreased TLPG (mean difference, -8.2 mm Hg; 95% CI, -10.1 to -6.3 mm Hg; P<.001). Exercise (regardless of modality) at -15 degrees HDT was associated with decreased IOP (mean difference, -1.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, -2.6 to -0.6 mm Hg; P=.002) and TLPG (mean difference, -3.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.2 to -0.7 mm Hg; P=.01) compared with rest. Both IOP (mean difference, 2.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.7-5.1 mm Hg; P=.01) and TLPG (mean difference, 5.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.8-9.4 mm Hg; P=.02) were higher in participants who wore swimming goggles compared with those not wearing goggles. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, exercise was associated with decreased IOP and estimated translaminar pressure gradient in a spaceflight analogue of HDT. The addition of swimming goggles was associated with increased IOP and TLPG in HDT. Further evaluation in spaceflight may be warranted to determine whether modestly increasing IOP is an effective SANS countermeasure.

TI SYNERGIC ACTIVITY OF COMBINED PROSTACYCLIN - DIMETHYL-SULFOXIDE IN
   EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN ISCHEMIA
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB We examined whether drugs that block calcium, prostaglandins, free radicals, and endorphin release could modify cerebral blood flow or nerve tissue pathology following a focal cerebrovascular lesion. Cats were randomly divided into six groups and were subjected to standard middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) performed using a transorbital approach. One hour after MCAO, cats received the following compounds intravenously: (i) saline (CS), 1.5 mL/kg or polyethylene glycol, 300-mu-g (CP); (ii) naloxone (NX), 2 mg/kg; (iii) nimodipine (NM), 1-mu-g.kg-1.min-1 x 60 min; (iv) dimethyl sulfoxide (DS), 0.9 g/kg in a 40% solution; (v) prostacyclin (PGI2), 200 ng.kg-1.min-1 for 60 min; or (vi) DS-PGI2 combined. At 1-h intervals, local CBF was recorded from the cortical tissue proximal and distal to the MCAO site using the hydrogen clearance method. Five hours after MCAO, cortical tissue was removed for catecholamine histofluorescence or perfused for tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive axon examination. Treatment with NX, NM, CP, or CS had no effect on either CBF or cortical tissue neurotransmitter morphology. PGI2 showed a transiently modest but significant increase of CBF, while DS provided moderate protection of catecholaminergic fibers and increased CBF by 27% after MCAO. The combination of DS-PGI2 resulted in significant cytoprotection of cortical catecholaminergic fibers and generated a sustained CBF increase of 68% of control values. These findings suggest that combining DS with PGI2 can yield a synergic effect with respect to cortical neurotransmitter and CBF protection after MCAO.

TI Brain tissue partial pressure of oxygen predicts the outcome of severe
   traumatic brain injury under mild hypothermia treatment
SO NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance and changes of brain tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PbtO2) in the course of mild hypothermia treatment (MHT) for treating severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI).
   Methods: There were 68 cases with sTBI undergoing MHT. PbtO2, intracranial pressure (ICP), jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were continuously monitored, and clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale score.
   Results: Of 68 patients with sTBI, PbtO2, SjvO2, and CPP were obviously increased, but decreased ICP level was observed throughout the MHT. PbtO2 and ICP were negatively linearly correlated, while there was a positive linear correlation between PbtO2 and SjvO2. Monitoring CPP and SjvO2 was performed under normal circumstances, and a large proportion of patients were detected with low PbtO2. Decreased PbtO2 was also found after MHT.
   Conclusion: Continuous PbtO2 monitoring could be introduced to evaluate the condition of regional cerebral oxygen metabolism, thereby guiding the clinical treatment and predicting the outcome.

TI Spontaneous resolution of direct carotid-cavernous fistulas: case series
   and literature review
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Spontaneous regression of direct carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) is extremely rare. Most of the patients with direct CCFs are usually treated using endovascular techniques. Spontaneous obliteration of the direct fistulas probably results from thrombosis of the venous drainage and/or cavernous sinus. We report spontaneous closure of nine direct CCFs in nine patients. From literature review, we found another 37 patients with 43 fistulas due to spontaneous obliteration of bilateral lesions in six cases. There was no spontaneous closure in large-sized fistula. The factors associated with spontaneous thrombosis of the fistulas may be low-flow and small-sized fistula, hypotension, severe ocular manifestations, dissections or spasm of carotid artery, and increased intracranial pressure. Spontaneous healing of direct traumatic CCFs should be confirmed with cerebral angiography. Conservative treatment of direct CCFs should be carefully restricted in patients with normal vision or minimal visual impairment, and the patients must be monitored closely for any changes in visual function. Prompt endovascular treatment for complete obliteration of the fistula should be performed in patients with rapidly progressive visual loss. Venous thrombosis can still effect vision and rerouting towards cortical veins remains a concern. Because spontaneous resolution cannot be reliably predicted, the fistula then should be treated rather than waiting for spontaneous thrombosis.

TI Application of Transcranial Color-coded Duplex Sonography in the
   Diagnosis and Management of Straight Sinus Thrombosis With Dural
   Arteriovenous Fistulae A Case Report
SO NEUROLOGIST
AB Introduction: Transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCS) with and without ultrasound contrast agent has been used to diagnose cerebral venous thrombosis, however, no experience in the diagnosis of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis and with dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) by contrast-enhanced TCCS has been reported yet. Case Report: The authors reported a 49-year-old male patient with straight sinus (StS) thrombosis and dAVF. Plain TCCS and contrast-enhanced TCCS demonstrated the direct presentation of the selected feeder and drainage veins of the dAVFs, arterialized venous flow waveform, and an enlarged optic nerve sheath diameter, indicating an increased intracranial pressure, and a filling defect in the StS even after administration of an ultrasound contrast agent. After intravascular thrombolysis and blockage of 2 feeders of the dAVF, TCCS still showed retrograde flow direction in the left basal vein and significantly elevated flow velocity in the StS, reflecting a high venous pressure caused by a high volume of arteriovenous shunt and severe stenosis in the StS. The patient's clinical manifestation did not substantially improve until 3 stents were implanted in the StS, and TCCS unveiled that the stents were well filled with flow signal, and the flow velocity in the StS dramatically decreased. Conclusions: TCCS could provide reliable data about the feeder and drainage veins of dAVF in our case. The extent of an increase in venous flow velocity may be closely associated with clinical manifestations, which may influence therapy. Moreover, TCCS possesses a unique advantage in terms of evaluating the patency of the stents compared with other neuroimaging techniques.

TI PTA Stent of Dural Sinuses in Brain DAVF: AReport of 4 Cases
SO CLINICAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Background and PurposeType I and IIa dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) have a low hemorrhagic risk, but are often the cause of debilitating tinnitus that requires treatment. While Onyx (R) and PHIL (Precipitating hydrophobic injectable liquid) transarterial embolization represent the first endovascular option, there are occasional cases where performing angioplasty and stenting of the affected sinus may lead to satisfactory results.Material and MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed four consecutive cases of patients with DAVF-induced pulsatile tinnitus secondary to type I and II DAVFs who were treated with angioplasty and stenting of the sinus only. All the patients had clinical and radiological long-term follow-up.ResultsWe noticed a significant radiological and clinical improvement in all the cases. Of the patients two were completely cured at follow-up with eradication of the neurological symptoms as well as the fistula, one was retreated with Onyx (R) for a very small residual shunt despite having no more tinnitus, and one showed improvement in venous drainage (from type IIa+b to type I fistula) without resolution of the fistula.ConclusionIn cases of type I and II DAVFs associated with sinus stenosis, angioplasty and stenting alone seem to be safe and effective. This treatment probably compresses the venules within the sinus walls, promoting thrombosis of the shunts thus solving the underlying cause of the fistula.

TI The effects of normal and hypertonic saline on regional blood flow and
   oxygen delivery
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB BACKGROUND: Boluses of crystalloids are frequently given to patients to optimize vital organ perfusion. However, their effect on regional blood flow and oxygen delivery in the normal mammalian circulation has not been studied. We compared the effects of normal or hypertonic (3%) saline or control on regional blood flow and oxygen delivery in normal animals.
   METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled animal study in seven merino, cross-ewes. We implanted chronic flow probes around aorta, coronary, renal, and mesenteric arteries. We randomized animals to three different interventions: observation (control), normal saline (1 L over 15 min), or 3% saline (300 mL, over 15 min). We continuously measured central hemodynamics and organ blood flow for 210 min.
   RESULTS: Both fluids increased heart rate, cardiac output, central venous pressure, peripheral conductance, coronary and mesenteric blood flow, and conductance in the first hour (P < 0.05). In the second and third hour, both maintained a greater cardiac output, total peripheral conductance, and mesenteric blood flow (P < 0.05) than control, but the difference decreased. In contrast, renal blood flow was unaffected and, because of hemodilution, renal oxygen delivery was decreased in the first hour (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, urine output and creatinine clearance increased (P < 0.05) in both groups. Finally, 3% saline significantly, but transiently, increased serum sodium and osmolarity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Normal and hypertonic saline have similar systemic and regional hemodynamic effects. They also have no effect on renal blood flow and initially decrease renal oxygen delivery while increasing urine output.

TI Pregnancy care and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with a shunt for
   hydrocephalus
SO CESKA GYNEKOLOGIE-CZECH GYNAECOLOGY
AB The number of patients with an implanted shunt reaching reproductive age and planning pregnancy is increasing thanks to advances in the treatment of hydrocephalus. Changes in the mother's organism, which are mainly related to the accumulation of water in the organism and the elevation of intra-abdominal pressure, contribute to the increased incidence of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Therefore, it is necessary to make a preconception exam and specify pregnancy management, a suitable method of childbirth dealing with potential complications. Possible malfunction of the shunt is solved individually according to the current neurological findings and taking into account the patient's overall condition and gestational age. Vaginal delivery is considered safe and preferred by most authors. Primary caesarean section is indicated only in patients with a history of rapidly progressing deterioration of the neurological condition due to shunt malfunction or serious complications related to its impaired shunt function. In an uncomplicated pregnancy with normal values of intracranial pressure, both general and epidural or spinal anesthesia can be used when choosing anesthesia.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study is to: 1) describe a newly discovered mechanism of blood flow to the brain during cardiopulmonary resuscitation using the impedance threshold device in a piglet model of cardiac arrest and 2) describe the survival benefits in humans of applying all of the highly recommended changes in the 2005 guidelines related to increasing circulation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including use of the impedance threshold device, from six emergency medical services systems in the United States.
   Design: Animal studies prospective trial with each piglet serving as its own control. Historical controls were used for the human studies.
   Subjects: Piglets and patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Interventions: Piglets (10-12 kg) were treated with an active (n = 9) or sham (n = 9) impedance threshold device after 6 mins of ventricular fibrillation. Humans were treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation per the American Heart Association 2005 guidelines and the impedance threshold device.
   Measurements and Main Results: Animals: The primary end-point in the piglet study was carotid blood flow which increased from 59 mL/min without an impedance threshold device to 91 mL/min (p = 0.017) with impedance threshold device use. Airway pressures during the chest recoil phase decreased from -0.46 mm Hg to -2.59 mm Hg (p = 0.0006) with the active impedance threshold device. Intracranial pressure decreased more rapidly and to a greater degree during the decompression phase of cardiopulmonary resuscitation with the active impedance threshold device. Humans: Conglomerate quality assurance data were analyzed from six emergency medical services systems in the United States serving a population of similar to 3 million people. There were 920 patients treated for cardiac arrest after implementation of the 2005 American Heart Association guidelines, including impedance threshold device use, and 1750 patients in the control group during the year before implementation. Demographics were similar between the two groups. Survival to hospital discharge was 9.3% in the control group versus 13.6% in the intervention group. The odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, and p value were 1.54 (1.19-1.99) and p = 0.0008, respectively. This survival advantage was conferred to patients with a presenting cardiac arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation (28.5% vs. 18.0%, p = 0.0008).
   Conclusions: Use of the impedance threshold device in piglets increased carotid blood flow and coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures and reduced intracranial pressure during the decompression phase of cardiopulmonary resuscitation at a faster rate than controls, resulting in a longer duration of time when intracranial pressures are at their nadir. Patents in six emergency medical services systems treated with the impedance threshold device together with the renewed emphasis on more compressions, fewer ventilations, and complete chest wall recoil had a nearly 50% increase in survival rates after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest compared with historical controls.

TI VIEshunt: towards a ventricular intelligent and electromechanical shunt
   for hydrocephalus therapy
SO FLUIDS AND BARRIERS OF THE CNS
AB BackgroundShunt systems for hydrocephalus therapy are commonly based on passive mechanical pressure valves that are driven by the intracranial, intra-abdominal, and hydrostatic pressure. The differential pressure acting on the valve determines the drainage rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but is not a gauge of the physiological condition of the patient. Internal and external influences can cause over- or underdrainage and lead to pathological levels of intracranial pressure (ICP).MethodsThe first prototype of a ventricular intelligent and electromechanical shunt (VIEshunt) is developed, tested, and compared with previous efforts towards the development of a smart shunt. Its key components are a micro pump, a flow meter, a pressure sensor, an inertial measurement unit, a wireless communication interface, and a microcontroller. The VIEshunt prototype was tested in vitro using a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) test bench that runs real-time patient simulations involving changes in intracranial and intra-abdominal pressure, as well as changes in posture ranging between supine and upright position. The prototype was subsequently tested in an in vivo pilot study based on an acute ovine animal model (n=1) with infusions of artificial CSF.ResultsDuring 24 h in vitro testing, the prototype detected the simulated posture changes of the patient and automatically adapted the controller reference. The posture-specific ICP references of 12 mmHg for supine and -3 mmHg for upright position were tracked without offset, thus preventing adverse over- and underdrainage during the investigated HiL test scenario. During acute in vivo testing, the prototype first regulated the mean ICP of a sheep from 22 mmHg down to 20 mmHg. Each of the three subsequent intraventricular bolus infusions of 1 mL saline solution increased mean ICP by approximately 11 mmHg. While natural absorption alone decreased ICP by only 5 mmHg within 9 min, the prototype was able to regulate ICP back to the pre-bolus pressure value within 5 min.ConclusionThe developed VIEshunt prototype is capable of posture-dependent ICP regulation and CSF drainage control. Smart shunt systems based on VIEshunt could improve patient monitoring and enable optimal physiologic therapy by adapting to the individual patient. To derive statistically relevant conclusions for the performance of VIEshunt, future work will focus on the development of a next generation prototype for use in pre-clinical studies.

TI Demographic profile and extent of healthcare resource utilisation of
   patients with severe traumatic brain injury: still a major public health
   problem
SO SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB INTRODUCTION Trauma is the fifth principal cause of death in Singapore, with traumatic brain injury (TBI) being the leading specific subordinate cause.
   METHODS This study was an eight-year retrospective review of the demographic profiles of patients with severe TBI who were admitted to the neurointensive care unit (NICU) of the National Neuroscience Institute at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, between 2004 and 2011.
   RESULTS A total of 780 TBI patients were admitted during the study period; 365 (46.8%) patients sustained severe TBI (i.e. Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8), with the majority (75.3%) being male. The ages of patients with severe TBI ranged from 14-93 years, with a bimodal preponderance in young adults (i.e. 21-40 years) and elderly persons (i.e. > 60 years). Motor vehicle accidents (48.8%) and falls (42.5%) were the main mechanisms of injury. Invasive line monitoring was frequently employed; invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring and central venous pressure monitoring were used in 81.6% and 60.0% of the patients, respectively, while intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement was required in 47.4% of the patients. The use of tiered therapy to control ICP (e.g. sedation, osmotherapy, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, moderate hyperventilation and barbiturate-induced coma) converged with international practices.
   CONCLUSION The high-risk groups for severe TBI were young adults and elderly persons involved in motor vehicle accidents and falls, respectively. In the NICU, the care of patients with severe TBI requires heavy utilisation of resources. The healthcare burden of these patients extends beyond the acute critical care phase.

TI Arginine vasopressin as a supplementary vasopressor in refractory
   hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilutional therapy in subarachnoid
   hemorrhage
SO NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB Introduction: Hypertensive, hypervolemic, and hemodilutional (HHH) therapy for vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) refractory to phenylephrine requires high doses of catecholamines, leading to adverse adrenergic effects. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been shown to stabilize advanced shock states while facilitating reduction of catecholamine doses, but its use has never been reported in SAH. In this retrospective study, we investigated the hemodynamic effects and feasibility of supplementary AVP in refractory HHH therapy in SAH.
   Methods: Hemodynamic response (mean arterial pressure [MAP], heart rate, central venous pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, and end diastolic volume index) to a supplementary AVP infusion (0.01-0.04 IU/minute) was recorded within the first 24 hours in 22 patients. Secondary endpoints (serum sodium concentration, incidence of vasospasm, and intracranial pressure [ICP]) were compared to controls on HHH therapy with phenylephrine alone.
   Results: After initiation of AVP, MAP increased significantly compared to baseline. Phenylephrine doses decreased significantly, whereas other hemodynamic parameters remained stable. Serum sodium concentrations decreased similarly in both groups (-5 +/- 7 mmol/L versus -6 +/- 4 mmol/L; p = 0.25). No detrimental effects on vasospasm incidence or ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure were noted.
   Conclusion: AVP may be considered as an alternative supplementary vasopressor in refractory HHH therapy with phenylephrine in SAH. Although we did not observe any deleterious effect of AVP on cerebral circulation, close observation for development of cerebral vasospasm should be undertaken, until it is clearly demonstrated that AVP has no adverse effects on regional cerebral blood flow and symptomatic cerebral vasospasm. Our limited data suggest that low-dose AVP does not cause brain edema, but further study is merited.

TI Effects of the intravenous administration of hypertonic solutions of
   sucrose - With special reference to the cerebrospinal fluid pressure
SO BULLETIN OF THE JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL
AB Thirty-five patients between 18 and 40 yrs. of age were given intraven. injections of various amts. of a 50% soln. of sucrose, and studies were made of the resulting changes in their urinary excretion, blood chemistry, and the pressure and content of the cerebrospinal fluid. When 300 to 500 cc. of this solution is administered intraven., the initial rise of cerebrospinal fluid pressure (probably coincident to the initial increase in blood volume and venous pressure) is of lesser degree and duration than is the case with dextrose or electrolytic solutions. Subsequently, the desired diminution in intra-cranial tension (probably resulting from the diuresis and tissue dehydration) is greater and more prolonged, whereas the terminal hypertension is less, than is the case with the dextrose or electrolytic solutions. The solution of sucrose employed does not cause an overt phlebitis in the injected vein, and induces only a mild reaction when allowed to escape in small amts. into the subcut. tissues. Large amts. of sucrose in the circulation are apparently not toxic and cause no serious disturbances in the chemistry or cytology of the blood. Sucrose administered intraven. produces a marked diuresis and is eliminated rapidly in the urine. Repeated injections can be given as indicated without cumulative adverse effects. As to the clinical use of hypertonic solutions of sucrose for the purpose of reducing the intra-cranial hypertension in patients with cerebral concussion, meningitis, etc., and pre-operatively in cases of brain tumor, the disturbances in cerebral circulation and tissue permeability that obtain in these conditions might modify the osmotic and dynamic effects here reported in normal individuals. These solns., because of their decompressive and diuretic effects, seem to deserve a careful clinical trial.

TI Anesthesia Management of Liver Transplantation
SO CONTEMPORARY LIVER TRANSPLANTATION: THE SUCCESSFUL LIVER TRANSPLANT
   PROGRAM
SE Organ and Tissue Transplantation
AB Anesthesia for liver transplantation pertains to a continuum of critical care of patients with end-stage liver disease. Hence, anesthesiologists, armed with a comprehensive understanding of pathophysiology and physiologic effects of liver transplantation on recipients, are expected to maintain homeostasis of all organ function. Specifically, patients with fulminant hepatic failure develop significant changes in cerebral function, and cerebral perfusion is maintained by monitoring cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, and intracranial pressure. Hyperdynamic circulation is challenged by the postreperfusion syndrome, which may lead to cardiovascular collapse. The goal of circulatory support is to maintain tissue perfusion via optimal pre-load, contractility, and heart rate using the guidance of right-heart catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography. Portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome have high morbidity and mortality, and they should be properly evaluated preoperatively. Major bleeding is a common occurrence, and euvolemia is maintained using a rapid infusion device. Pre-existing co-agulopathy is compounded by dilution, fibrinolysis, heparin effect, and excessive activation. It is treated using selective component or pharmacologic therapy based on the viscoelastic properties of whole blood. Hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia from massive transfusion, lack of hepatic function, and the postreperfusion syndrome should be aggressively treated. Close communication between all parties involved in liver transplantation is also equally valuable in achieving a successful outcome.

TI Malignant Cerebral Edema After Cranioplasty: A Case Report and
   Literature Insights
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
AB Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Decompressive craniectomy is a common life-saving intervention in the setting of elevated intracranial pressure. Cranioplasty restores the calvarium and intracranial physiology once swelling recedes. Cranioplasty is often thought of as a low-risk intervention. However, numerous reports indicate that malignant cerebral edema (MCE) is an often-fatal complication of an otherwise uneventful cranioplasty. A careful review of the literature is needed to better understand this devastating condition. Case Report: A 41-year-old man presented after suffering a gunshot wound to the right frontal lobe. Upon initial evaluation, the patient had grossly visible brain matter, left-sided hemiparesis with a Glascow Coma Score (GCS) of 11, and vital signs concerning for elevated intracranial pressure. Computed tomography (CT) showed right-sided intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage with a 5 mm leftward midline shift. The patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for right fronto-parietal craniectomy. Over the next 3 months, he recovered steadily and underwent PEEK cranioplasty on post-operative day 83. Pre-operative CT showed sunken skin flap syndrome with an 8-mm midline shift. Following an uneventful cranioplasty, he failed to regain consciousness. Examination revealed absent brainstem reflexes. CT showed global diffuse cerebral edema. The patient was declared brain dead. Conclusions: Continued research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of malignant cerebral edema so that future incidences may be prevented. A combination of negative-pressure suction drainage, sunken skin flap syndrome, and delayed time to cranioplasty likely play a significant role in the evolution of MCE. We urge neurosurgeons to consider the likelihood of MCE and adapt surgical planning accordingly.

TI My paper 20 years later: cerebral venous oxygen saturation studied with
   bilateral samples in the internal jugular veins
SO INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Jugular oxygen saturation monitoring was introduced in neurointensive care after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) to explore the adequacy of brain perfusion and guide therapeutic interventions. The brain was considered homogeneous, and oxygen saturation was taken as representative of the whole organ. We investigated whether venous outflow from the brain was homogeneous by measuring oxygen saturation simultaneously from the two jugular veins.
   In 32 comatose TBI patients both internal jugular veins (IJs) were simultaneously explored using intermittent samples; hemoglobin saturation was also recorded continuously by fiber-optic catheters in five patients. In five cases long catheters were inserted bilaterally upstream, up to the sigmoid sinuses.
   On average, measurements from the two sides were in agreement (mean and standard deviation of the differences between the saturation of the two IJs were respectively 5.32 and 5.15). However, 15 patients showed differences of more than 15 % in hemoglobin saturation at some point; three others showed differences larger than 10 %. No relationship was found between the computed tomographic scan data and the hemoglobin saturation pattern.
   Several groups have confirmed differences between oxygen saturation in the two jugular veins. After years of enthusiasm, interest for jugular saturation has decreased and more modern methods, such as tissue oxygenation monitoring, are now available. Jugular saturation monitoring has low sensitivity, with the risk of missing low saturation, but high specificity; moreover it is cheap, when used with intermittent sampling. Monitoring the adequacy of brain perfusion after severe TBI is essential. However the choice of a specific monitor depends on local resources and expertise.

TI TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ATTENUATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LACTATED RINGERS
   SOLUTION RESUSCITATION OF HEMORRHAGIC-SHOCK IN RATS
SO SURGERY GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
AB Traumatic brain injury suppresses spontaneous cardiovascular compensation for hemorrhage, prompting us to examine the possibility that trauma to the brain modifies hemodynamic response to therapy in hemorrhage.  Thirty rats that were anesthetized were randomly assigned to four groups-hemorrhagic shock (H), hemorrhagic shock after brain trauma (TH), hemorrhagic shock treated with lactated Ringer's (LR) solution (HR), and hemorrhagic shock after brain trauma treated with LR (THR).  After hemorrhage, group TH had significantly lower mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume index (SVI) than group H.  Throughout the postresuscitative period, group HR had significantly higher MAP, CI, SVI and central venous pressure than group H.  At 50 and 70 minutes after the start of hemorrhage, group THR showed significantly lower MAP, CI and SVI than group HR.  This difference in hemodynamics is not because of transcapillary refill effect, because brain trauma did not cause changes in hematocrit and plasma protein levels.  As heart rate, preload and afterload were not significantly different between groups THR and HR, the attenuation of fluid resuscitation can be attributed mainly to a depressed cardiac function.  Furthermore, neither brain trauma nor fluid replacement altered the content of water in the brain in hemorrhaged rats.  These data indicate that brain trauma not only suppresses spontaneous hemodynamic recovery from hemorrhage, but also impedes the efficacy of LR resuscitation.  The results of the current study suggested that a more aggressive fluid replacement may be needed to treat hemorrhagic shock in individuals with brain injury.

TI Changes in spatial QRS-T angle and QTc interval in patients with
   traumatic brain injury with or without intra-abdominal hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY
AB Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects cardiac electrical function, and several extra-cerebral factors, including intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), might further modulate this brain-heart interaction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of TBI, and of increased IAP during TBI, on cardiac electrical function as measured by vectorcardiographic (VCG) variables.
   Methods: Survival, IAP and changes in VCG variables including spatial QRS-T angle and QTc interval were measured in consecutive adult patients with either isolated TBI (iTBI), or with TBI accompanied by polytrauma to the abdomen and/or limbs (pTBI). For all patients, observations were performed just after the admission to the ICU (baseline) and at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after admission.
   Results: 74 patients aged 45 18 were studied. 44 were treated for iTBI and 30 for pTBI. In all patients, spatial QRS-T angle and QTc interval increased after TBI (p < 0.001), relatively more so in patients with pTBI. Compared to survivors, non-survivors also ultimately had greater widening of the spatial QRS-T angle (p < 0.001), most notably just before foraminal herniation. Wider spatial QRS-T angle and longer QTc interval were also noted in patients with IAP > 12 mmHg (p < 0.001), and with right compared to left hemispheric injury (p < 0.001). ST segment level at the J point decreased 24 and 48 h after TBI in leads 1,11,111, aVR, aVF, V-1, V-2, V-3 and V-6, and increased in lead V-1, especially in non-survivors.
   Conclusions: Spatial QRS-T angle and QTc interval increase after TBI. If foraminal herniation complicates TBI, further widening of the spatial QRS-T angle typically precedes it, followed by notable narrowing thereafter. Increased IAP also intensifies TBI-associated increases in spatial QRS-T angle and QTc interval. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Intracranial compliance (ICC) determines the ability of the intracranial space to accommodate increase in volume (e.g., brain swelling) without a large increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). Therefore, measurement of ICC is potentially important for diagnosis and guiding treatment of related neurological problems. Modeling based approach uses an assumed lumped-parameter model of the craniospinal system (CSS) (e.g., RCL circuit), with either the arterial(6,7) or the net transcranial blood flow(1) (arterial inflow minus venous outflow) as input and the cranio-spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow as output. The phase difference between the output and input is then often used as a measure of ICC4,6,7,11. However, it is not clear whether there is a predetermined relationship between ICC and the phase difference between these waveforms. A different approach for estimation of ICC has been recently proposed(2). This approach estimates ICC from the ratio of the intracranial volume and pressure changes that occur naturally with each heartbeat. The current study evaluates the sensitivity of the phase-based and the direct approach to changes in ICC. An RLC circuit model of the cranio-spinal system is used to simulate the cranio-spinal CSF flow for 3 different ICC states using the transcranial blood flows measured by MRI phase contrast from healthy human subjects. The effect of the increase in the ICC on the magnitude and phase response is calculated from the system's transfer function. We observed that within the heart rate frequency range, changes in ICC predominantly affected the amplitude of CSF pulsation and less so the phases. The compliance is then obtained for the different ICC states using the direct approach. The measures of compliance calculated using the direct approach demonstrated the highest sensitivity for changes in ICC. This work explains why phase shift based measure of ICC is less sensitive than amplitude based measures such as the direct approach method(2).

SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Cerebrospinal fluid disturbance (CSFD) is a well-known complication after occipitocervical decompression (OCD) in patients with Chiari malformation type I (CMI). There is scarce data focusing on preoperative patients' factors predisposing to development of CSF disturbance. The aim of this study is to evaluate a prognostic value of some patients' factors in the prediction of CSFD after OCD in CMI patients.
   We undertook a 10-year (2003-2013) retrospective study of all OCD in patients with CMI performed at Sahlgrenska IC, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden. A total of 52 consecutive patients were obtained from the operation database and we excluded one patient who was previously diagnosed with normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Data regarding preoperative age, body mass index, gender, degree of tonsillar herniation and syrinx were registered. Development of CSFD after OCD was noted.
   Of the 51 patients reviewed, six had CSFD after OCD and were managed using a form of CSF diversion procedure. All of the patients who developed CSFD were females. They had a mean body mass index of 32.3 compared to a mean of 24.3 in patients without CSFD (p = 0.0011). There was no difference between the two groups with regard to the other examined patient factors.
   CSF diversion was needed in six consecutive adult Chiari malformation type I patients who underwent occipitocervical decompression. All patients with postoperative CSFD were female and their mean BMI was significantly higher than patients without this complication.

SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Background: Ultrasound can influence the diagnosis and impact the treatment plan in critical patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether, without encountering major environment-or patient-related limitations, ultrasound examination under a critical care ultrasonography protocol can be performed to detect occult anomalies, to prompt urgent changes in therapy or induce further testing or interventions, and to confirm or modify diagnosis.
   Methods: One hundred and twenty-five consecutive patients admitted to a general intensive care unit were assessed under a critical care ultrasonography protocol, and the data were analyzed prospectively. Systematic ultrasound examination of the optic nerve, thorax, heart, abdomen, and venous system was performed at the bedside.
   Results: Environmental conditions hampered the examination slightly in 101/125 patients (80.8%), moderately in 20/125 patients (16%), and strongly in 4/125 patients (3.2%). Ultrasonographic findings modified the admitting diagnosis in 32/125 patients (25.6%), confirmed it in 73/125 patients (58.4%), were not effective in confirming or modifying it in 17/125 patients (13.6%), and missed it in 3/125 patients (2.4%). Ultrasonographic findings prompted further testing in 23/125 patients (18.4%), led to changes in medical therapy in 22/125 patients (17.6%), and to invasive procedures in 27/125 patients (21.6%).
   Conclusions: In this series of patients consecutively admitted to an intensive care unit, ultrasound examination revealed a high prevalence of unsuspected clinical abnormalities, with the highest number of new ultrasound abnormalities detected in patients with septic shock. As part of rapid global assessment of the patient on admission, our ultrasound protocol holds potential for improving healthcare quality.

TI A narrative review of the clinical application of pressure reactiviy
   indices in the neurocritical care unit
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Pressure reactivity indices are used in clinical research as a surrogate marker of the ability of the cerebrovasculature to maintain cerebral autoregulation. The use of pressure reactivity indices in patients with neurological injury represents a potential to move away from population-based physiological targets used in guidelines to individualized physiological targets. The aim of this review is to describe the underlying principles and development of pressure reactivity indices, alongside a critique of how they have been used in clinical research, including their limitations. The primary source literature was identified from a database search of PUBMed and OVID online using the search terms "pressure reactivity index" and "pressure reactivity indices". The evidence base regarding pressure reactivity indices currently remains Level III. Pressure reactivity indices rely on the correlation (-1 to +1) between the arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure, with negative values indicating intact cerebral autoregulation and positive values indicating dysfunctional cerebral autoregulation. Meaningful data is taken from summary measures and trends. The traumatic brain injury population feature most prominently in the literature. There is limited description of the potential confounding factors that may affect pressure reactivity indices, including physiological parameters and therapeutic interventions. Plotting a pressure reactivity index against a cerebral perfusion pressure can indicate an optimal cerebral perfusion pressure to individualise patient care. There is potential to over interpret optimal cerebral perfusion pressure targets when the values of pressure reactivity indices are close to zero. There is an association between pressure reactivity indices and neurological outcomes, however the use of pressure reactivity indices as a prognostication tool is to be challenged. Average values of cerebral perfusion pressure that are not close to averaged values of optimal cerebral perfusion pressure are also associated with poor outcome. Further research is required to ascertain whether targeting an optimal cerebral perfusion pressure may alter outcome.

TI NITROPRUSSIDE-INDUCED HYPOTENSION AND CEREBROVASCULAR AUTOREGULATION IN
   THE ANESTHETIZED PIG
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB The influence of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular autoregulation at doses that produced 36% +/- 3% (slight) and 52% +/- 4% (moderate) reductions of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was evaluated in mechanically ventilated fentanyl/N2O-anesthetized pigs.  The blood flow of the frontal hemispheres was evaluated by sagittal sinus outflow, which was determined by an electromagnetic method.  Integrity of cerebral autoregulation was evaluated by two formal tests:  one hypertensive challenge with an angiotensin infusion (n = 12) and one hypotensive challenge with reduced venous return to the heart (blockade of the vena cava, n = 7).  The tests were performed before, during, and after hypotension.  Cerebral blood flow tended to increase during hypotension, but this change was not significant.  Impaired autoregulation was seen in both tests during slight hypotension (MABP = 89 +/- 3 mm Hg) with an SNP infusion of 12 +/- 3-mu-g.kg-1.min-1.  Cerebral autoregulation was completely abolished at both tests during moderate hypotension (MABP = 61 +/- 2 mm Hg with an SNP infusion of 38 +/- 7-mu-g.kg-1.min-1).  Despite a posthypotensive increase in cerebral blood flow without rebound hypertension, the autoregulatory response to angiotensin-induced hypertension was restored within 15-25 min.  The autoregulatory response to a decrease in MABP was impaired for more than an hour after discontinuation of the SNP infusion.  No acidosis was observed.  The authors conclude that during slight and moderate SNP-induced hypotension, there was a dose-dependent impairment of cerebral autoregulation.  Further, the autoregulatory response to the hypotensive challenge after SNP hypotension was markedly delayed, whereas the response to hypertension was rapidly restored.

TI Unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations and hydrocephalus: Case
   series and review of the literature
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Objective: Hydrocephalus is an uncommon presentation of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The goal of this case series and literature review is to present possible pathological mechanisms, management strategies and outcomes in patients with hydrocephalus due to unruptured AVMs.
   Methods: Three consecutive patients with hydrocephalus caused by unruptured AVMs as well as all cases previously reported in the literature were retrospectively reviewed to determine clinical symptoms, AVM location, nidus size, venous drainage, mechanism of hydrocephalus, level/cause of obstruction, and degree of hydrocephalus. Management of hydrocephalus, AVM treatment, and follow-up length were evaluated.
   Results: Of 350 patients unruptured AVMs, 3 presented with hydrocephalus (0.8%). In the literature review we found an additional 22 patients for a total of 25 cases. Eighteen patients had mechanical obstruction by the draining vein or the AVM nidus, usually at the level of the aqueduct (52%). Impaired cerebrospinal fluid resorption secondary to venous congestion led to hydrocephalus in 7 patients. Ten patients were treated for both the AVM and hydrocephalus, 13 patients underwent treatment of either hydrocephalus, or the AVM alone. Treatment of hydrocephalus, with or without associated treatment of the brain AVM, resulted in improvement of symptoms in 92% of patients. No rupture of the AVM was reported at follow-up.
   Conclusions: The most common cause of hydrocephalus in unruptured brain AVMs is mechanical obstruction by the draining vein if it is located in a strategic position. Treatment of hydrocephalus alone or with associated treatment of the AVM is safe and effective. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI THE EFFECTS OF HIGH-FREQUENCY POSITIVE-PRESSURE VENTILATION ON
   INTRA-CRANICAL PRESSURE AND BRAIN SURFACE MOVEMENT IN CATS
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Compared to traditional low-frequency ventilation (LFV), mechanical ventilation at high frequencies (60-200 breaths/min) and low tidal volumes (HFV) eliminates respiratory-synchronous variations in blood pressure; minimizes ventilatory effects on the cardiovascular system; reduces peak airway pressures; and suppresses spontaneous respiratory efforts. Since these and other properties may make HFV useful to patients with acute intracranial pathology, the effects of HVF on intracranial pressure (ICP) were studied in cats. Compared with LFV (rate 11/min, tidal volume = 15 ml/kg), HFV (rate 100/min, VT = 3.3 ml/kg) had little effect on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, right atrial pressure, mean ICP or mean cerebral perfusion pressures, even if baseline ICP was raised using an epidural balloon. HFV effectively eliminated ventilator-linked fluctuations in both blood pressure and ICP, and at all levels of mean ICP studied (4.8, 15 and 30 torr) significantly reduced the peak ICP seen during a single respiratory cycle. The reduction in ICP fluctuation and peak pressure was more pronounced as intracranial complicance fell. The physiologic significance of such a change in the ICP pressure waveform is unknown. Because of the observed influence of HFV on ICP fluctuations, its effects on the physical movement of the exposed brain were examined using a non-contact, inductive displacement measuring device. During LFV the cortical surface moved in and out by 0.36 .+-. 0.1 (.+-. SD) mm, a distance sufficient to make microscopic focusing difficult. Changing to HFV reduced surface movement to 0.05 .+-. 0.01 mm, producing a very stable surface. HFV may play an important role in the intraoperative management of patients undergoing certain neurosurgical procedures, particularly those requiring microsurgical techniques where reduced brain movement may facilitate surgery.

TI <i>In Vitro</i> Hydrodynamic, Transient, and Overtime Performance of a
   Miniaturized Valve for Hydrocephalus
SO ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Reliable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) draining methods are needed to treat hydrocephalus, a chronic debilitating brain disorder. Current shunt implant treatments are characterized by high failure rates that are to some extent attributed to their length and multiple components. The designed valve, made of hydrogel, steers away from such protracted schemes and intends to provide a direct substitute for faulty arachnoid granulations, the brain's natural CSF draining valves, and restore CSF draining operations within the cranium. The valve relies on innate hydrogel swelling phenomena to strengthen reverse flow sealing at idle and negative pressures thereby alleviating common valve failure mechanisms. In vitro measurements display operation in range of natural CSF draining (cracking pressure, P (T) similar to 1-110 mmH(2)O and outflow hydraulic resistance, R (h) similar to 24-152 mmH(2)O/mL/min), with negligible reverse flow leakage (flow, Q (O) > -10 A mu L/min). Hydrodynamic measurements and over-time tests under physically relevant conditions further demonstrate the valve's operationally-reproducible properties and strengthen its validity for use as a chronic implant.

SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Five of 10 patients who commenced successful highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) concurrent with or soon after a diagnosis of cryptococcal infection experienced clinical events characterized by sterile inflammation. Two patients developed aseptic meningitis with elevated intracranial pressure, 1 developed intrathoracic lyphadenopathy with hypercalcemia, 1 developed cavitary pneumonia at the site of a cryptococcal nodule, and 1 developed a supraclavicular abscess. These events occurred 2- 11 months after initiation of HAART. For 3 patients, biopsy demonstrated findings atypical for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome- associated cryptococcosis. Results of fungal cultures were negative for all 5 patients, and cryptococcal antigen levels had declined markedly in 4 patients. The timing and clinical features of and biopsy findings for these cases of cryptococcosis suggest the existence of a paradoxical reaction to Cryptococcus infection that occurs in the context of HIV immune restoration.

AB The concomitant effects elf infusions of catecholamines on cerebral blood how (CBF): intracranial pressure (ICP), arterio-venous oxygen content difference (AVDO(2)), and cerebral oxygen utilization (COU) were prospectively studied in an intact cerebral autoregulatory model.
   Epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine were infused at doses used in clinical practice in awake, chronically catheterized sheep (n = 5). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), CBF and ICP were measured continuously, COU was expressed as delta CBF x AVDO(2).
   All 3 drugs significantly increased MAP in a dose dependent manner. Norepinephrine and epinephrine had no significant effects on ICP, CBF, AVDO(2) or COU at infusions of 0-60 mu g/min. Infusions of dopamine from 0-60 mu g/kg/min resulted in statistically significant increases in ICP (+34.5 +/- 3.7 to +97.2 +/- 6.8) and CBF (+13.3 +/- 3.2 to +52.6 +/- 23.3) (% change baseline +/- SEM, 95% CI. ANOVA), reduction in AVDO(2) (3.54 +/- 0.2. to 2.69 +/- 0.2 mg%) and a biphasic response in COU. In the intact physiological model, induced hypertension by epinephrine and norepinephrine is not associated with global changes in CBF, ICP or COU which remain constant. At equivalent doses, dopamine causes cerebral hyperaemia, increased ICP and increased global cerebral oxygen utilization.

TI Peripheral VA-ECMO and pericardial drainage connected to the ECMO
   circuit for cardiac tamponade from blowout rupture: a case report
SO BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
AB BackgroundLeft ventricular free wall rupture, particularly the blowout type, is still one of the most lethal complications of myocardial infarction and can cause catastrophic cardiac tamponade. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is often used to treat haemodynamic instability due to cardiac tamponade. However, elevated pericardial pressure can cause collapse of the right atrium, resulting in inadequate ECMO inflow and preventing the stabilisation of the circulation. Further, it can interfere with the venous return from the superior vena cava (SVC), increasing the intracranial pressure and reducing cerebral perfusion levels.Case presentationA 65-year-old man was hospitalised for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We used ECMO for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After the establishment of ECMO, transthoracic echocardiography and left ventriculography revealed massive pericardial effusion. The treatment was supplemented with pericardial drainage since ECMO flow was frequently hampered by suction events. However, the blowout rupture led to the requirement of constant drainage from the pericardial catheter. To tend to this leak, we connected the venous cannula of ECMO and the pericardial drainage catheter. The surgery was performed with stable circulation without suction failure of ECMO. During the course of the intensive care management, the neurological prognosis of the patient was revealed to be poor, and the patient was shifted to palliative care. Unfortunately, the patient died on day 10 of hospitalisation.ConclusionWe present a case wherein the combination of pericardial drainage and ECMO was used to maintain circulation in a patient with massive pericardial effusion due to cardiac rupture.

TI A Case Series Study of Airway Pressure Release Ventilation in Patients
   with Intracranial Pathologies and Acute Respiratory Failure
SO JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Background: Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) is an alternate mode of ventilation in acute respiratory failure (ARF), but there is inconsistent data to support its use over other modes of ventilation. Because of increased intrathoracic pressure for most of the respiratory cycle, a negative impact of APRV on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) has been hypothesized. We evaluated the effects of APRV ventilation, with particular attention to ICP, CPP and ICP-directed therapy, in a real-world cohort of neuro-ICU patients. Methods: Retrospective single-center analysis from January 2021 to December 2023 of neurosurgical ICU patients with ICP monitoring. APRV was used as a rescue mode at the physician's discretion when the Horovitz index (PaO2/FIO2 ratio) fell below 150 despite optimized conventional ventilation. Results: Between 2021 and 2023, APRV was utilized in 29 patients undergoing a total of 60 episodes. Forty patients (66.7%) were female, median age was 49.5 (Q1 34; Q3 61.25) years. After transition to APRV, mean FiO2 decreased by 4.3% (t = 3.5, p < .001) and mean PaO2 increased by 22.7 mm Hg (t = 4.2, p < .001). The Horovitz index improved by 44.6 mm Hg (t = 4.9, p < .001). Mean compliance did not differ after transition to APRV (-1.5 ml/mbar, t = -0.9, p = .4). During the APRV episode, mean ICP was 1.2 mm Hg lower (t = 2.6, p = .01), while mean CPP was 1.6 mm Hg higher (t = -0.9, p = .4) and the intensity of ICP-directed therapy (TIL) was significantly lower (X-2 = 92.771, p < .001). Conclusion: APRV was hemodynamically tolerated in 29 out of 33 patients, and was safe with regard to ICP, CPP, and the intensity of ICP-directed therapy. Oxygenation was increased by APRV. 4 out of 33 patients would not tolerate APRV for hemodynamic reasons, APRV therefore was stopped immediately.

TI An Exploration of Anti-Inflammatory Therapy in Acute/Subacute Severe
   Cerebral Venous Thrombosis with Hereditary Protein C/S Deficiency: Case
   Series
SO JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION RESEARCH
AB Background: Inflammation was associated with the severity of severe cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) on admission and poor prognosis at discharge. Hereditary protein C/S deficiency (hereditary PCD/PSD) not only promotes thrombosis but also activates the inflammatory response, further inducing venous thrombosis. However, conventional treatments such as standard anticoagulant/ endovascular therapy (EVT) do not seem to improve prognosis. Anti-inflammatory therapy may be a new way to treat the disease.Methods: We enrolled five patients with acute/subacute severe CVT with hereditary PCD/PSD from January 2020 to July 2022. In addition to standard anticoagulant therapy, all of them were given short-term methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Neurological deficit, increased intracranial pressure, venous recanalization, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers and adverse events were retrospectively described before and after treatment and at 6 months after discharge.Results: Inflammatory indexes of all patients were significantly elevated on admission. After methylprednisolone pulse therapy, serum inflammatory indexes including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P=0.043); platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (P=0.043); systemic immune inflammatory index (P=0.043); interleukin-6 (P=0.043) and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (P=0.022) reduced dramatically compared with baseline. CSF inflammatory indexes had a decreasing trend compared with baseline (P>0.05). In terms of venous recanalization, one patient achieved complete recanalization, four patients obtained partial recanalization. Compared with baseline on admission, the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and intracranial pressure were all considerably lower at discharge (P=0.029, P=0.041 and P=0.017). At 6-month follow-up, NIHSS and mRS further declined. During hospitalization and 6-month follow-up, none of the five patients experienced severe steroid-related adverse effects such as recurrence of venous thrombosis, spontaneous fracture or osteonecrosis, and gastroduodenal ulcer.Conclusion: Acute/subacute severe CVT with hereditary PCD/PSD has high levels of inflammation. In addition to conventional anticoagulant therapy, early anti-inflammatory therapy using steroids may be necessary. Nevertheless, substantial randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required for further investigation.

TI Nimodipine can improve cerebral metabolism and outcome in patients with
   severe head trauma
SO PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB In the present study, the effect of nimodipine was investigated in a patient with severe head trauma. Nimodipine was administered into the peripheral vein to prevent secondary neuronal damages in patients. The five patients in control group were treated according to the standard procedures without nimodipine. Other five patients in nimodipine group were treated with standard procedures plus nimodipine. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), intracranial pressure (ICP), jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO(2)), jugular lactate and glucose levels were measured. Additionally, all patients were evaluated with Glascow outcome score (GOS) before discharge. It was found that CPP (p < 0.05) and SjvO(2) (p < 0.05)were significantly higher; but, ICP (p < 0.001),jugular lactate (p < 0.05) and jugular glucose (p < 0.05) were lower in nimodipine than that of control groups. Again, GOS values were significantly higher in nimodipine than that of control groups (p < 0.05). Results of this study revealed that nimodipine can improve cerebral metabolism and outcome in patient with severe head trauma. Thus, nimodipine may be considered as a protective agent against severe head trauma related neuronal injuries. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Vascular tunnel construction in the treatment of severe brain swelling
   caused by trauma and SAH.: (Evidence based on intra-operative blood flow
   measure)
SO NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB Decompressive craniectomy with durotomy, is possible as a last resort therapy for severe traumatic brain swelling. Although the method successfully diminishes the ICP, partial or total vascular insufficiency occurs in the herniated part of the brain. The actual cause of the insufficiency is most likely due to the compression of the cortical veins and arteries supplying the herniated brain, caused by shearing and pressure forces between the dural edge and brain tissue. Furthermore venous congestion may induce edema in the protruding parts of the brain, thus further compromising neurone viability. The new surgical technique consists of a stellate type durotomy and the creation of a vascular tunnel around the main cortical veins and arteries, with the aim that the vessels do not become compressed by the dural or bone edge. The effect of the novel vascular tunnel technique was proven by measuring the blood flow of the protected and nonprotected veins with Doppler UH, intra-operatively. In the last two years 28 patients were operated on with this method. One case of edema was caused by SAH. All were in severe GCS 3 or GCS 4 status, with more than 30 mmHg ICP. In comparison with the traditional surgical and nonsurgical treatment, where the reported mortality rates are 80%-90% in these severe cases the mortality rate was reduced to 40%, and recovery (GOS 4, 5) rate also increased significantly. With this technique the ICP was significantly reduced and further edema and vascular insufficiency was prevented. This was due to protection of the arterial circulation and venous drainage of the herniated part of the brain, by the formation of a vascular tunnel at the durotomy edges.

TI Experimental Investigation of Cavitation as a Possible Damage Mechanism
   in Blast-Induced Traumatic Brain Injury in Post-Mortem Human Subject
   Heads
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB The potential of blast-induced traumatic brain injury from the mechanism of localized cavitation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is investigated. While the mechanism and criteria for non-impact blast-induced traumatic brain injury is still unknown, this study demonstrates that local cavitation in the CSF layer of the cranial volume could contribute to these injuries. The cranial contents of three post-mortem human subject (PMHS) heads were replaced with both a normal saline solution and a ballistic gel mixture with a simulated CSF layer. Each were instrumented with multiple pressure transducers and placed inside identical shock tubes at two different research facilities. Sensor data indicates that cavitation may have occurred in the PMHS models at pressure levels below those for a 50% risk of blast lung injury. This study points to skull flexion, the result of the shock wave on the front of the skull leading to a negative pressure in the contrecoup, as a possible mechanism that contributes to the onset of cavitation. Based on observation of intracranial pressure transducer data from the PMHS model, cavitation onset is thought to occur from approximately a 140 kPa head-on incident blast.

TI Traumatic brain injury: physiology, mechanisms, and outcome
SO CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY
AB Purpose of review This review on traumatic brain injury consolidates the substantial current literature available on the pathophysiology, mechanisms, developments, and their subsequent effects on outcome. In particular, it tries to conceptualize why our greatly improved understanding of pathophysiology and neurobiology in traumatic brain injury has not translated into clear outcome improvements.
   Recent findings Early cerebral ischaemia has been characterized further, with ischaemic brain volume correlating with 6-month outcome. The Brain Trauma Foundation has revised perfusion pressure targets, and there are additional data on the outcome impact of brain tissue oxygen response and asymmetric patterns of cerebral autoregulation. Mechanistic studies have highlighted the role of inflammation and introduced concepts such as therapeutic vaccination and immune modulation. Experimental neurogenesis and repair strategies show promise. Despite continuing gains in knowledge, the experimental successes have not yet translated to the clinic. Indeed, several major articles have attempted to understand the clinical failure of highly promising strategies such as hypothermia, and set out the framework for further studies (e.g. addressing decompressive craniectomy). High-dose mannitol has shown promise in poor grade patients, while hypertonic saline has shown better intracranial pressure control. Negative results may be the consequence of ineffective therapies. However, there is a gathering body of work that highlights the outcome impact of subtle neurocognitive changes, which may not be quantified adequately by outcome measures used in previous trials. Such knowledge has also informed improved definition of mild traumatic brain injury, and allowed validation of management guidelines.
   Summary The evidence base for current therapies in this heterogeneous patient group is being refined, with greater emphasis on long-term functional outcomes. Improved monitoring techniques emphasize the need for individualization of therapeutic interventions.

TI Differential pressure in shunt therapy: investigation of
   position-dependent intraperitoneal pressure in a porcine model
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB Object. The differential pressure between the intracranial and intraperitoneal cavities is essential for ventriculoperitoneal shunting. A determination of the pressure in both cavities is decisive for selecting the appropriate valve type and opening pressure. The intraperitoneal pressure (IPP)-in contrast to the intracranial pressure still remains controversial with regard to its normal level and position dependency.
   Methods. The authors used 6 female pigs for the experiments. Two transdermal telemetric pressure sensors (cranial and caudal) were implanted intraperitoneally with a craniocaudal distance of 30 cm. Direct IPP measurements were supplemented with noninvasive IPP measurements (intragastral and intravesical). The IPP was measured with the pigs in the supine (0 degrees), 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and vertical (90 degrees) body positions. After the pigs were euthanized, CT was used to determine the intraperitoneal probe position.
   Results. With pigs in the supine position, the mean (+/- SD) IPP was 10.0 +/- 3.5 cm H2O in a mean vertical distance of 4.5 +/- 2.8 cm to the highest level of the peritoneum. The difference between the mean IPP of the cranially and the caudally implanted probes (Delta IPP) increased according to position, from 5.5 cm H2O in the 0 degrees position to 11.5 cm H2O in the 30 degrees position, 18.3 cm H2O in the 60 degrees position, and 25.6 cm H2O in the vertical body position. The vertical distance between the probe tips (cranially implanted over caudally implanted) increased 3.4, 11.2, 19.3, and 22.3 cm for each of the 4 body positions, respectively. The mean difference between the A IPP and the vertical distance between both probe tips over all body positions was 1.7 cm H2O.
   Conclusions. The IPP is subject to the position-dependent hydrostatic force. Normal IPP is able to reduce the differential pressure in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts.

TI Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension May Be an Under-recognized Cause of
   Endolymphatic Hydrops
SO OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY
AB Objective: We describe three rare cases of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) presenting with symptoms of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) and perform a literature review to bring attention to a rare link between SIH and EH.
   Patient: A 59-year-old female presented with postural headache, aural fullness, vertigo, hearing loss, and abnormal electrocochleography after being diagnosed with SIH by magnetic resonance imaging. The site of cerebrospinal fluid leak was identified in this individual. Two additional patients with vertigo, hearing loss, and SIH were identified by retrospective chart review.
   Intervention: All patients underwent blood patches. One patient also had diuretic treatment while another had fibrin glue injection.
   Main Outcome Measures: The outcomes of interest were resolution of headache, vertigo, aural fullness, and hearing loss.
   Results: All patients eventually improved with time. Literature review suggests that overall outcome is excellent.
   Conclusions: SIH may be an under-recognized cause of EH. We support the theory that negative intracranial pressure transmitted through the cochlear aqueduct and perilymph leads to EH. Despite the variations in treatments, the overall prognosis is excellent.

TI Comparison of equiosmolar hypertonic saline and mannitol for brain
   relaxation during craniotomies: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled
   trials
SO NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW
AB There is a controversy about the effects of hypertonic saline (HS) used for brain relaxation in patients requiring craniotomies. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of equiosmolar hypertonic saline with mannitol on intraoperative brain relaxation in patients undergoing craniotomies. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The outcome indicators included brain relaxation, hemodynamic status, fluid volume, and blood chemistry. A total of nine RCTs involving 665 patients were identified and included. There was a greater increase in the odds of good intraoperative brain relaxation in the HS group (odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 similar to 3.01; P=0.0002) compared with mannitol. In comparison with HS, mannitol slightly reduced the central venous pressure (CVP) (mean difference (MD) 1.03, 95% CI 0.03 similar to 2.03; P=0.04) as well as significantly increasing the diuretic effect regardless of the dosage of HS (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.86, 95% CI -1.35 similar to-0.37; P=0.0006). HS increased the plasma sodium level significantly (MD 7.86, 95% CI 2.78 similar to 12.95, P=0.002) but reduced the intraoperative fluid intake (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.98 similar to-0.15, P=0.008). However, there were no significant differences in plasma osmolality and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Our results suggest that there appears to be better brain relaxation without a significant increase in urine volume in the HS group compared with mannitol in patients requiring craniotomies. High-quality RCTs with larger sample sizes will be required in the future to confirm the conclusions.

TI Superficial Cerebral Venous Thrombosis and Intracerebral Hematoma in a
   48-Year-Old Man with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Case Report
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
AB Objective: Unusual clinical course
   Background: Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe respiratory symptoms are a hallmark of the disease, which may also include complications related to a hypercoagulable state and central nervous system involvement. These complications can occur during either the acute or the recovery phase. The cerebral involvement typically manifests as intracranial hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, diffuse encephalopathy, or cerebral venous thrombosis. The hemorrhagic form of cerebral venous thrombosis can be a diagnostic challenge and is treated by anticoagulation therapy, despite the existence of an intracerebral hemorrhage. This report describes a case of superficial cerebral venous thrombosis and intracerebral hematoma in a 48-year-old man weeks after recovering from the acute phase of SARSCoV-2 infection.
   Case Report: A 48-year-old man with a past medical history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction presented with left upper-limb numbness, weakness, and impaired positional sensorium. After initial stabilization, noncontrast computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an intracerebral hemorrhage with underlying cerebral venous thrombosis. The patient was successfully treated with enoxaparin anticoagulation therapy, and symptoms improved over the following 12 days.
   Conclusions: Central nervous system venous thrombosis is an atypical presentation of the hypercoagulable state primarily seen in younger patients, and it can occur in a delayed fashion after recovery from mild forms of COVID-19.

TI Sulcal Cavitation in Linear Head Acceleration: Possible Correlation With
   Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a significant public health and financial concern that is affecting tens of thousands of people in the United States annually. There were over a million hospital visits related to TBI in 2017. Along with immediate and short-term morbidity from TBI, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can have life-altering, chronic morbidity, yet the direct linkage of how head impacts lead to this pathology remains unknown. A possible clue is that chronic traumatic encephalopathy appears to initiate in the depths of the sulci. The purpose of this study was to isolate the injury mechanism/s associated with blunt force impact events. To this end, drop tower experiments were performed on a human head phantom. Our phantom was fabricated into a three-dimensional extruded ellipsoid geometry made out of Polyacrylamide gelatin that incorporated gyri-sulci interaction. The phantom was assembled into a polylactic acid 3D-printed skull, surrounded with deionized water, and enclosed between two optical windows. The phantom received repetitive low-force impacts on the order of magnitude of an average boxing punch. Intracranial pressure profiles were recorded in conjunction with high-speed imaging, 25 k frames-per-second. Cavitation was observed in all trials. Cavitation is the spontaneous formation of vapor bubbles in the liquid phase resulting from a pressure drop that reaches the vapor pressure of the liquid. The observed cavitation was predominately located in the contrecoup during negative pressure phases of local intracranial pressure. To further investigate the cavitation interaction with the brain tissue phantom, a 2D plane strain computational model was built to simulate the deformation of gyrated tissue as a result from the initiation of cavitation bubbles seen in the phantom experiments. These computational experiments demonstrated a focusing of strain at the depths of the sulci from bubble expansion. Our results add further evidence that mechanical interactions could contribute to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and also that fluid cavitation may play a role in this interaction.

TI Unusual clinical manifestations of disturbed CSF dynamics in
   hydrocephalic children
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Objects:Clinical symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may be nonspecific and unreliable, or even entirely absent, in hydrocephalic infants and children. Even with a radiological examination. it is often difficult to distinguish between "arrested hydrocephalus" and slowly progressive hydrocephalus requiring treatment. Methods: We present two cases with unusual and initially misleading clinical manifestations of increased ICP. In both cases, the disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, i.e. raised ICP, were not recognised until demonstrated by a long-term ICP monitoring. In a 5-month-old boy with normal head circumference and normal psychomotor development, the sudden onset of episodes of torticollis and screaming were the only symptoms. No pathology underlying the developing hydrocephalus and the raised ICP could be established, but the boy's condition improved after a shunt operation. In the other case, symptoms and signs consisted primarily in a slowly progressive dilatation of the facial veins with onset at the age of 2-3 years. As the girl also presented a congenital subvalvular aortic stenosis, the venous congestion was initially thought to reflect a vena cava superior syndrome. Further radiological examinations, however, revealed an extensive sinus thrombosis underlying the raised ICP. The girl underwent shunt insertion, and the venous congestion was reduced. Conclusions: The cases illustrate that though clinical and radiological findings may be very doubtful, or unusual for increased ICP, direct diagnostic long-term ICP monitoring should always be contemplated. Only ICP monitoring can reveal with certainty whether disturbed CSF dynamics are involved, requiring a CSF diverting operation to treat and stabilise the condition.

TI Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: a case series and literature
   review
SO FOLIA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
AB Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a condition of negative intracranial pressure resulting from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the dural sac and is a well-known cause of orthostatic headache. Diagnosis and management can be difficult, often requiring coordination between multiple disciplines. Low CSF pressure and diffuse meningeal enhancement on brain MRI are the major instrumental features of the classic syndrome. Neuroimaging plays a key role in diagnosing SIH, particularly in atypical clinical presentations, by recognizing the specific findings of brain sagging on MRI and detecting the level of CSF leak on spinal imaging, thus guiding therapy accordingly. Since SIH could present with such a heterogeneous clinical picture, careful history taking and increased awareness of atypical presentations are of utmost importance. We review the existing SIH literature, illustrate management, clinical and neuroimaging findings of four consecutive patients with atypical SIH, who were recently referred to our hospital for evaluation to simplify and streamline the management of SIH.

TI Comparative Analysis of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O Versus 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O
   PEEP on Cerebral Oxygen Saturation in Brain Tumor Surgery: A Randomized
   Controlled Clinical Study
SO MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
AB Background: The main concern regarding lung-protective ventilation strategies during neurosurgery is the reduction in venous return and increase in cerebral blood flow when using high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). This study aimed to evaluate and compare the changes in regional cerebral oxygen saturations (rSO(2)) during the use of 5 cmH(2)O and 10 cmH(2)O PEEP in patients undergoing craniotomy for tumor resection. Material/Methods: The study was designed as a prospective, single-blind randomized controlled study. Patients aged between 18 and 70 years, scheduled for an elective craniotomy for tumor resection, were divided into 2 groups: 5 cmH(2)O PEEP (Group Low PEEP) and 10 cmH(2)O PEEP (Group High PEEP). The PEEP was applied during general anesthesia, for controlled mechanical ventilation. The main outcome was the measurement of rSO(2) before dura opening. Changes in rSO(2), hemodynamic parameters, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) during different periods of surgery were compared between the groups. Results: Sixty-four patients were included. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding demographic data. Mean arterial blood pressure and changes in SpO(2) were statistically similar in all periods between the groups (P=0.141 and P=0.081). When compared with the baseline value, SpO(2) increased significantly at all measurement times (P<0.05). No difference was observed in rSO(2) values compared with baseline rSO(2) values between the groups (P=0.218). Conclusions: PEEP at the level of 10 cmH(2)O can be safely applied during craniotomy without altering hemodynamics, and without causing a decrease in rSO(2).

TI THE VENOOCCLUSIVE MECHANISM OF THE CANINE CORPUS-CAVERNOSUM -
   ANGIOGRAPHIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDIES
SO JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
AB Studies were designed to document the normal angiography and pressure-volume characteristics of the canine corpus cavernosum, evaluate the effects of various vasoactive agents, and characterize a veno-occlusive mechanism. In fourteen dogs, baseline cavernosography demonstrated venous drainage via six to ten tributaries arising from the crura and entering the deep penile veins. Control cavernosometry during infusion of saline at 0.33 ml./sec. led to a rise in intracavernosal pressure (ICP) from  24.9 .+-. 7.9 mm. Hg to 68.4 .+-. 21.1 mm. Hg. Intracavernosal injection of a number of vasodilators, including papaverine, nitroglycerin, acetylcholine, and prostaglandin E2, raised base-line ICP significantly, caused extreme elevation of pressure during saline infusion (> 450 mm. Hg), and narrowed or obliterated the venous lumena at the site of tunica perforation, as judged angiographically. These effects could be reversed with phenoxybenzamine or norepinephrine. Our results further support the current understanding of the canine veno-occlusive mechanism.

TI A new method for assessing transverse sinus stenosis with CT venography
   based on the venous trans-stenotic pressure gradient
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Evaluation of the transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) is essential for TSS-related diseases. Objective To investigate a new method for the quantitative assessment of TSS based on the correlation between TSS and trans-stenotic pressure gradient (TPG). Methods Patients with unilateral pulsatile tinnitus with or without idiopathic intracranial hypertension were retrospectively included. All patients underwent CT venography and venous manometry and were confirmed to have TSS. The cross-sectional diameter/area of TSS, the poststenotic and prestenotic segments, and the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) were measured. The degree of TSS was calculated by dividing the diameter/area of TSS by the diameter/area of the poststenotic segment (M1/M2), prestenotic segment (M3/M4), and SSS (M5/M6). Partial correlation analysis (controlling for the effect of age, sex, outflow laterality, and contralateral stenosis) was performed to evaluate the correlation between M1-M6 and the TPG. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of M1-M6 for diagnosing a significant TPG (>= 8 mm Hg) was performed. Results Ninety-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. The partial correlation coefficients between M1-M6 and the TPG were 0.60, 0.61, 0.43, 0.48, 0.39, and 0.54, respectively. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of M1-M6 for diagnosing a significant TPG were 0.81, 0.86, 0.68, 0.69, 0.64, and 0.72, respectively. The AUC of M2 was significantly larger than that of M3 (P=0.002), M4 (P<0.001), M5 (P=0.001), and M6 (P<0.001). Conclusions Quantitatively assessing TSS by taking the ratio of the cross-sectional area of TSS to that of the poststenotic segment might be a more efficient method for predicting the TPG.

TI Predicting the Rapid Improvement of Papilledema After Stenting in

SO CLINICAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Purpose This study aimed to identify predictors of rapid improvement of papilledema after stenting and develop a simple preintervention scale.Methods A prospective cohort of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with venous sinus stenosis (VSS) treated with stenting in a tertiary hospital from January 2014 to December 2019 was reviewed. We categorized papilledema improvement into favorable (grades 0-1) and unfavorable (grades 2-5). We employed logistic regression analysis to find the predictive factors and develop the predictive scale. We then estimated the performance of the scale using the ROC curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow test.Results There were 110 patients who underwent venous sinus stenting, with a mean age of 37.1 years and a predominance of females (77.3%). A total of 85 patients had a favorable outcome following stenting, while 25 patients had an unfavorable outcome. The results of the multivariate analysis indicate that lower preoperative pressure gradients (odds ratio, OR: 4.01; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.27-12.68), stenosis rates (OR: 4.16; 95% CI: 1.11-15.56), and preoperative papilledema grades (OR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.44-5.91) were independently associated with rapid improvement of papilledema following stenting treatment. The 3-item scale exhibited good discrimination with an area under the curve (AOC) of 0.81 (95% CI 0.72-0.89, p < 0.001), as well as acceptable calibration determined by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (P = 0.42). The optimal cut-off value of the scale (range 0-6 points) was >= 4 points, with a sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 73%, and accuracy of 78%.Conclusion The presence of lower preoperative pressure gradients, stenosis severity, and preoperative status of papilledema were identified as positive predictors of rapid improvement of the papilledema following stenting in IIH patients. The 3-item scale provides a promising preintervention predictive model for predicting rapid response following stenting treatment in IIH patients with VSS.

TI Clinical differences between acute CVST and non-thrombotic CVSS
SO CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
AB Background: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare stroke subtype, which has many overlapping symptoms with non-thrombotic cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS) in the acute phase. Despite these similarities, their therapeutic regimens and outcomes are entirely different, and treatment delay is life-threatening. This study aims to address their clinical differences to help promote proper patient care.
   Methods: 34 cases of CVST and 34 cases of non-thrombotic CVSS diagnosed with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in the acute phase (symptoms onset within 7 days) were consecutively enrolled in this prospective non-randomized and controlled study. Differences between CVST and CVSS in their clinical manifestation, plasma biomarkers, and MR or DSA imaging were compared.
   Results: CVST and CVSS overlap in many ways, but differ in their respective medical histories and neurological deficits. However, 20.6% of CVST and 64.7% of CVSS occur without a definitive medical history, and 70.6% of CVST and 64.7% of CVSS occur without focal neurologic deficits. In the acute phase of CVST, D-dimer and fibrinogen are found to be abnormally elevated in 94.1% and 73.5% of cases, respectively. In the CVSS group, D-dimer and fibrinogen are only elevated in 17.6% and 5.9% of cases, respectively (binary logistic regressions test, all P < 0.001). In the CVST group, the predominant features in MRI/MRV and DSA imaging include local brain lesions, flow void signal loss, non-visualization, and a local filling defect sign at the involved sinus. Conversely, in the CVSS group, imaging revealed symmetrically small bilateral ventricles and the spread of cerebral edema in MRI/MRV. DSA imaging in the CVSS group revealed external compression and a narrow sinus with disproportionate venous engorgement. Despite these findings, positive imaging only appears in a minority of patients in the two groups during the acute phase (Table 4).
   Conclusions: DSA may be beneficial to diagnose CVST in ambiguous patients suspected to have either CVST or CVSS. Clinically useful biomarkers (D-dimer and fibrinogen) may predict CVST in the emergency room in the ambiguous patients with or without equivocal MRI/MRV imaging. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI Intracranial Hemorrhage From Cerebral Venous Thrombosis With
   Hypereosinophilia and Positive Dengue Serology in a Child: A Rare Case
   and Challenges in Management
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Hypereosinophilia is a rare condition, defined as a persistent elevation of absolute eosinophil count greater than 1.5x109/L and/or tissue eosinophilia. This condition can be caused by numerous different etiologies, both hematological (clonal) and non-hematological (reactive). Reactive hypereosinophilia encompasses all disorders, including infections. Patients with hypereosinophilia may experience a spectrum of clinical consequences due to multiple organ damage, including neurologic and thrombotic complications, associated with organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening sequelae. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is the term used to describe thrombotic occlusion of veins and/or venous sinuses in the brain. This condition can occur at all ages and CVT related to hypereosinophilia is a rare disease. Diagnosis of the disease must be done quickly because thrombosis causes blockage of cerebral drainage, venous congestion, disruption of cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption, ischemic neuronal damage, cerebral edema, and hemorrhage, leading to severe neurological complications. Management of intracranial hemorrhage from CVT due to hypereosinophilia is a challenging task for clinicians, based on anticoagulation therapy, systemic corticosteroid, management of elevated intracranial pressure, and potentially progressive hemorrhage due to anticoagulant. The outcome of the patient generally relies on early detection, prompt, and appropriate treatment. In this case report, we discuss a rare case of CVT with hypereosinophilia and positive dengue serology in a child, in the context of intracranial hemorrhage, enlightening the importance of considering a personalized strategy in the management of this complex scenario.

TI Sinus pericranii associated with craniosynostosis
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Sinus pericranii is a vascular tumor of the head having communication with the dural venous system. The tumor enlarges with increased intracranial pressure when the patient is in the lateral recumbent position. Since Stromeyer used the term "sinus pericranii" in his report in 1850, approximately 170 cases have been reported. However, relatively few cases of sinus pericranii have been reported in association with craniosynostosis or by plastic surgeons. In this study, we report seven cases of sinus pericranii associated with craniosynostosis. There were two patients with Apert syndrome, two with Crouzon syndrome, two with oxycephaly, and one with trigonocephaly. The sites of occurrence were the parietal region in six patients and the frontal region in one patient. In either type of case, the tumor was clinically a soft subcutaneous mass of the head. The clinical characteristics of the tumor were its disappearance when the patient was in a sitting position and its appearance when the patient was in a recumbent position or crying. The patients were preoperatively diagnosed with sinus pericranii from imaging test findings, such as from magnetic resonance imaging and aforementioned clinical findings. In all cases, treatment for sinus pericranii was performed during the surgery for craniosynostosis. For patients with lesions in either site, we did not perform craniotomy, and we used a minimally invasive method of tumor excision and resection of the sites of communication using electrocoagulation. Perioperatively, heavy hemorrhage was not observed, and, postoperatively, no recurrence has been observed in any patient. In this study, we examine the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of sinus pericranii, in particular for patients with craniosynostosis.

TI Childhood hydrocephalus secondary to posterior fossa tumor is both an
   intra- and extraaxial process
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB OBJECTIVE Ventricular dilation secondary to tumor obstruction of the posterior fossa CSF outflow in childhood is an intraaxial process. However, third ventriculostomy or complete tumor removal often fails to reduce the pressure in some children, and in others there is a delayed reduction in intracranial pressure; this is termed the adaptation period. The cause of this adaptation period has not been studied. Venous sinus compression is highly correlated with other forms of childhood hydrocephalus, and this study seeks to follow the changes that occur in sinus cross-sectional area after surgery.
   METHODS Twelve children with posterior fossa tumors underwent MRI examination that included standard T2-weighted and 3D contrast-enhanced images obtained preoperatively, in the immediate postoperative period, and after several months. The volumes of the lateral and third ventricles and the minimum cross-sectional area of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses were measured. Patients were categorized by 1) shunt status (those who required a shunt vs those who did not) and 2) by age (those younger than 3 years vs those older than 3 years at diagnosis).
   RESULTS There was a significant reduction in ventricular volume in both the immediate and secondary follow-up periods for all patients. There was preoperative venous sinus compression in all groups, which did not change significantly in the immediate postoperative period but did improve in the secondary follow-up period. The younger children had larger ventricles and smaller sinuses before surgery compared with the older children.
   CONCLUSIONS In children with obstructed hydrocephalus caused by tumor, there is secondary compression of venous outflow, indicating both an intra- and extraaxial process. The expansion of the sinuses following decompression of the posterior fossa is delayed and may correlate with the adaptation period. Younger children have greater sinus compression than older ones.

TI Venous Infarction Associated with a Sigmoid Sinus Dural Arteriovenous
   Fistula A Case Report
SO NEURORADIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Dural arteriovenous fistulas with restricted antegrade venous flow and reflux into a dural sinus or cortical veins lead to intracranial venous hypertension. This type of venous hypertension in return may cause parenchymal damage by mechanisms similar to those proposed for venous infarction. A 42-year-old man presented with homonymous hemianopsia of the right upper visual field. Computed tomography demonstrated hypointensity in the left occipital lobe. Angiography confirmed dural arteriovenous fistula of the left sigmoid sinus, severe stenosis and occlusion of the left sigmoid sinus and reversal of the flow in the cortical veins. This fistula was treated with Onyx-18. This report emphasizes an unusual coexistence of venous infarction with sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistula causing neurological symptoms.

TI Optimal pressure in penile rehabilitation with a vacuum erection device:
   evidence based on a rat model
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY
AB Vacuum erection device (VED), used to treat radical prostatectomy (RP)-associated erectile dysfunction, has attracted considerable attention. However, the optimal negative pressure remains to be determined. This investigation explored the optimal pressure for VED therapy in penile rehabilitation. Thirty-six 9-week-old male rats were randomly divided into six groups: control groups (sham group, bilateral cavernous nerve crush [BCNC] group) and VED therapy groups (-200 mmHg group, -300 mmHg group, -400 mmHg group, -500 mmHg group). BCNC group and VED therapy groups underwent BCNC surgery. Intracavernosal pressure (ICP)/mean arterial pressure (MAP) ratio was calculated to assess erectile function. Masson's trichrome (MT) staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed to explore cellular and molecular changes of the penis. Compared to the BCNC group, ICP/MAP ratios in all VED treatment groups were improved significantly (all P < 0.05), but there were no statistically significant differences among VED therapy groups. With increased pressure, complications gradually emerged and increased in frequency. Expression of molecular indicators, such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), increased after VED therapy, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) decreased. In addition, VED therapy improved the outcomes of MT and TUNEL assay. This investigation demonstrated a pressure of -200 mmHg in a rat model is optimal for VED therapy for penile rehabilitation after RP. No further benefits were observed with increased pressure, despite an increase in complications.

TI Low-pressure Hydrocephalus in Children: A Case Series and Review of the
   Literature
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is a rare phenomenon characterized by a clinical picture consistent with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and ventricular enlargement, but also a well-functioning shunt and low or negative ICP.
   OBJECTIVE: To report our experience in evaluating this challenging problem. METHODS: Patients with LPH were identified from several sources, including institutional procedural databases and personal case logs. Electronic medical records were reviewed to collect demographic, clinical, surgical, and radiographic data to determine the presence of LPH. Each patient's clinical course, including presentation, management, and outcome, is reported.
   RESULTS: Thirty instances of LPH were identified in 29 patients. Eleven cases (37.9%) of LPH were after lumbar puncture (LP), and 19 cases (62.1%) occurred without any preceding spinal procedure. Among the post-LP patients, conservative measures alone were successful in 3 cases (27%); lumbar blood patch was successful in 2 cases (18%); and 6 cases (55%) required external cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Of the spontaneous cases, 5 patients did not receive the full spectrum of treatment because of terminal prognosis. Of the remaining 14 patients, 11 (78.6%) required external CSF drainage. Post-LP patients required fewer days of external CSF drainage (median, 4 [range, 0-12] vs median, 11 [range, 0-90]) and had a shorter hospital stay (median, 2 [range, 2-16] vs median, 8 [range, 0-26]).
   CONCLUSION: This study represents the largest series of LPH. Although its pathophysiology remains a mystery, there are a variety of management options. Multiple procedures and a protracted hospital stay are often required to successfully treat LPH.

TI ANALYSES OF PEDESTRIAN'S HEAD-TO-WINDSHIELD IMPACT BIOMECHANICAL
   RESPONSES AND HEAD INJURIES USING A HEAD FINITE ELEMENT MODEL
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB Head injuries in the vehicle crashes or pedestrian accidents can usually cause death or permanent disabilities, and head injuries resulting from the impact of car windshields remain a major problem. Anatomically, more realistic head models are required to more accurately document and evaluate the head-to-windshield impact responses and head injuries. The current study developed a head finite element model and carried out various simulations to investigate the head-to-windshield impact biomechanical responses and assess the head injuries. First, a 50th percentile three-dimensional finite element head model was developed and validated by using previously published cadaver experimental data. Then, the biomechanical responses were predicted under a head-to-windshield impact at different impact velocities (10, 12, and 15 m/s) and different inclination angles of the windshield (35 degrees, 40 degrees, and 45 degrees). Finally, head injuries were investigated through examining various injury parameters. The results indicated that the contact force, the acceleration, the intracranial pressure, the deformation of the skull, and the negative pressure rose when the impact velocity and the inclination angles increased. Thus, the vehicle impact velocity and the inclination angle of the windshield greatly affect the severity of the resulting injuries on pedestrians' heads, with the severity increasing with the impact velocity and windshield inclination angle.

TI Physical Characteristics in the New Model of the Cerebrospinal Fluid
   System
SO COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM
AB It is unknown which factors determine the changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure inside the craniospinal system during the changes of the body position. To test this, we have developed a new model of the CSF system, which by its biophysical characteristics and dimensions imitates the CSF system in cats. The results obtained on a model were compared to those in animals observed during changes of body position. A new model was constructed from two parts with different physical characteristics. The,cranial,, part is developed from a plastic tube with unchangeable volume, while the,,spinal part is made of a rubber baloon, with modulus of elasticity similar to that of animal spinal dura. In upright position, in the "cranial" part of the model the negative pressure appears without any measurable changes in the fluid volume, while in "spinal" part the fluid pressure is positive. All of the observed changes are in accordance to the law of the fluid mechanics. Alterations of the CSF pressure in cats during the changes of the body position are not significantly different compared to those observed on our new model. This suggests that the CSF pressure changes are related to the fluid mechanics, and do not depend on CSF secretion and circulation. It seems that in all body positions the cranial volume of blood and CSF remains constant, which enables a good blood brain perfusion.

TI Induction of hypothermia in patients with various types of neurologic
   injury with use of large volumes of ice-cold intravenous fluid
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: Mounting evidence suggests that mild to moderate hypothermia can mitigate neurologic and myocardial injury. The speed of induction appears to be a key factor in determining its efficacy. However, even when the fastest currently available cooling techniques are used, reaching target temperatures takes at least 2 hrs and usually longer. We hypothesized that infusion of refrigerated fluids could be a safe accessory method to increase cooling speed.
   Design: Prospective intervention study.
   Setting: University teaching hospital.
   Patients: One hundred thirty-four patients with various types of neurologic injury (postanoxic encephalopathy, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or traumatic brain injury).
   Measurements and Main Results: Hypothermia was induced in 134 patients with various types of neurologic injury, by means ice-water cooling blankets and infusion of refrigerated (4 degrees C) saline (110 patients) or saline and colloids (24 patients). An average volume of 2340 +/- 890 mL of refrigerated fluids was infused in 50 mins. Core temperatures decreased from 36.9 +/- 1.9 degrees C to 34.6 +/- 1.5 degrees C at t = 30 mins and to 32.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C at t = 60 mins (target temperature: 32 degrees C-33 degrees C). Monitoring of blood pressure, heart rhythm, central venous pressure, blood gasses, electrolyte and glucose levels, and platelet and white blood cell count revealed no additional adverse effects. Mean arterial pressure increased by 15 mm Hg, with larger increases in blood pressure occurring in hemodynamically unstable patients. No patient developed pulmonary edema.
   Conclusions. Induction of hypothermia by means of cold-fluid infusion combined with ice-water cooling blankets is safe, efficacious, and quick. Because the speed of cooling is important to increase its protective effects, we recommend that cold-fluid infusion be used in all patients treated with induced hypothermia. This should be combined with another method to safely and accurately maintain hypothermia once target temperatures have been reached.

TI Chiari 1 malformation and untreated sagittal synostosis: a new subset of
   complex Chiari?
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Purpose Chiari 1 malformation (CM1) is a well-known association with complex craniosynostosis (CC), while it has been rarely reported in association with monosynostosis. The aim of the present study is to investigate on the association between CM1 and untreated sagittal synostosis (USS). Method The study included 48 cases of sagittal synostosis (SS), untreated for misdiagnosis and associated with CM1. The children were firstly diagnosed for CM1 by MRI (mean age 9) than for SS (mean age 10.5) by three-dimensional computerized tomography (3D-CT), which documented the absence of the sagittal suture, in the presence of residual indentation of all the other sutures. Syndromic cases were diagnosed by clinical evaluation and molecular studies. Results Of the 48 children harboring CM1 plus USS, 21 were asymptomatic for CM1 and are still on follow-up, while 27 children were operated for syringomyelia and scoliosis and/or occurrence of symptoms, three of them had an acute presentation (two papilledema and one sleep apneas) and 11 children had a documented increase of preoperative ICP. Craniovertebral decompression (CVD) was the first-line surgery in 24 children, 16 with duroplasty and five without and eight had also cerebellar (CBL) tonsil coagulation. A cranial vault remodelling was firstly performed in three children. Fifteen percent of children submitted to CVD needed a revision for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, while two needed both the supra- and infratentorial decompressive procedure and another two needed a treatment for the associated hydrocephalus. Conclusions The present study identified an USS in 27 (15.5%) of 174 CM1 children operated for a symptomatic CM1. We suggest to define this association CM1 plus USS, a new subtype of complex CM1. For the high percentage of complications and multiple procedures needed to solve the CM1, we advise to identify by 3D-CT scan these children before performing CVD. Our finding suggests also that, if left untreated, SS may lead to the delayed occurrence of a challenging subset of CM1.

TI Optimizing Anesthetic Management for Laparoscopic Surgery: A
   Comprehensive Review
SO MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
AB Laparoscopy, as the most frequently chosen surgical technique in the world, carries specific complications and distinctions in anesthetic management. Complications of laparoscopy, particularly perceptible as disorders of the physiology of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems, are caused by the specific technical conditions required for this type of operation. To facilitate surgical access and to clarify the surgical field, it is necessary to create a splenic emphysema, consisting of filling the peritoneal cavity with carbon dioxide (CO2). This results in an increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and increased diffusion of CO2 into the blood, causing a state of hypercarbia. The impact of these disturbances is of great importance in the pathological functioning of the above-mentioned organ systems. The anesthetist, in addition to the need to induce a state of general anesthesia, must be aware of and understand the pathological impact of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and hypercarbia to adjust patient monitoring accordingly and implement appropriate treatment targeting the specific complications occurring during laparoscopy. Complications and contraindications important from the anesthetist's point of view are also described. The 51 articles and reference texts were used for this purpose, which, combined with the authors' knowledge and experience, is intended to be a valuable resource for use by anesthesiology staff. This article aims to explain the effects of laparoscopy on human physiology and to compare and contrast methods of airway management, mechanical ventilation, the type of muscle relaxation used, and postoperative management in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

TI Mild hypercapnia improves brain tissue oxygen tension but not diffusion
   limitation updates in asphyxial cardiac arrest: an experimental study in
   pigs
SO BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Background: We sought to evaluate the effect of mild hypercapnia on brain tissue oxygen tension (Pbto(2)) and diffusion limitation (impaired ability of oxygen extraction) in a porcine post asphyxial cardiac arrest model.
   Methods: In 16 Bama pigs, asphyxial cardiac arrest was induced by endotracheal tube clamping and remained untreated for another 4 min. After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), animals were randomly assigned to mild hypercapnia (end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2): 45 similar to 50 mmHg) and normocapnia (EtCO2: 35 similar to 40 mmHg) groups for 12 h. Intracranial pressure (ICP), Pbto(2), and brain tissue temperature were invasively measured by multimodality monitors. Blood gas analysis, neuron specific enolase (NSE), and S100 beta were tested at baseline, ROSC 1 h, 6 h, and 12 h. Generalized mixed model with a compound symmetry covariance matrix was used to compare the time-variables of the two groups.
   Results: Twelve (75%) pigs had ROSC and 11 pigs survived for the study period, with 6 pigs in mild hypercapnia group and 5 in the normocapnia group. The mean EtCO2 in the mild hypercapnia was significantly higher than normocapnia group (48 vs 38 mmHg, p < 0.001). Compared with normocapnia, mild hypercapnia group had higher Pbto(2) (p < 0.001), slightly higher mean arterial pressure (p = 0.012) and ICP (p = 0.009). There were no differences in cerebral perfusion pressure (p = 0.106), gradient of partial pressure of jugular venous bulb oxygen (Pjvo(2)) and Pbto(2) (p = 0.262), difference of partial pressure of jugular venous CO2 and arterial CO2 (p = 0.546), cardiac output (p = 0.712), NSE (p = 0.822), and S100 beta (p = 0.759) between the two groups.
   Conclusions: Short term mild hypercapnia post-resuscitation could improve Pbto(2). However, no corresponding improvements in the gradient of Pjvo(2) to Pbto(2) and biomarkers of neurological recovery were observed in the porcine asphyxial cardiac arrest model.

TI Infection surveillance and control programs in the Department of
   Veterans Affairs nursing home care units: A preliminary assessment
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB A survey was conducted to assess the capacity and current practices of the infection surveillance and control programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs' 130 nursing home care units (VA NHCUs) covering a total of 15,006 beds in 2003. All 130 VA NHCUs responded to the survey, although not all NHCUs answered every question. The majority of the VA NHCUs provided specialized services that might pose increased risks of infection. For every 8 to 10 VA NHCU beds, there was I regular-pressure or negative-pressure infection control room available. Each VA NHCU had an active ongoing infection surveillance and control program managed by highly educated infection control personnel (ICP), of which 96% had a minimum of a bachelor degree. A median of 12 hours per week of these ICP efforts was devoted to the infection surveillance and control activities. The most frequently used surveillance methods were targeted surveillance for specific infections and for specific organisms. Most VA NHCUs conducted surveillance for antibiotic-resistant organisms. However, VA NHCUs did not use a uniform set of definitions for nosocomial infections for their infection surveillance and control purposes. We conclude that VA NHCUs have a considerable infrastructure and capacity for infection surveillance and control. This information can be used to develop a nationwide VA NHCU nosocomial infection surveillance system.

TI Low pressure hydrocephalus and ventriculomegaly: hysteresis, non-linear
   dynamics, and the benefits of CSF diversion
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Low pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is a rare clinical condition. We report our experience with 10 patients treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. We reviewed the records of 10 patients (five men, five women; mean age 43 years) treated between 1996 and 2000. All underwent intracranial. pressure (ICP) monitoring and subatmospheric cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage with an intraventricular or lumbar catheter. All patients developed ventriculomegaly: five following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage; one after meningitis; one after intraventricular haemorrhage. Three patients presented with chronic aqueductal stenosis. Ventriculomegaly was clinically detected on average 12 days after presentation. Mean ICP was 4.8 mmHg (range 0-10). All patients improved only in the setting of negative pressure CSF drainage, and were subsequently treated with low pressure ventriculo- or lumboperitoneal shunts. At 1 year, eight patients (80%) showed good recovery to minimal disability; seven patients (70%) had resolving ventriculomegaly. The mechanism of low pressure hydrocephalus remains unclear. In our cohort, different aetiologies were responsible for the change in compliance/elastance of the brain parenchyma and subsequent development of ventriculomegaly. We propose that while ventriculomegaly (and therefore neuronal dysfunction) can be initiated in the setting of high ICP, the maintenance of ventriculomegaly at normal or low ICP is a physiological example of hysteresis. This behaviour, which has been characterized by the chaos theory of non-linear dynamics as a Hopf bifurcation, explains how a system can exhibit two different states (ventricular size) at a single parameter value (ICP). Most importantly, it helps to explain how lowering ICP in the setting of LPH can resolve ventriculomegaly and its neurologic sequelae.

TI Outcomes of venous sinus stenosis stenting in patients with pulsatile
   tinnitus and sigmoid sinus wall anomalies
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) and sigmoid sinus wall anomalies (SSWAs) are the most common causes of pulsatile tinnitus (PT). While these conditions may co-occur, they usually require different management approaches. This study aims to evaluate whether TSS stenting alone, without targeted treatment of SSWAs, is sufficient to resolve PT in patients presenting with PT, TSS, and SSWAs.Methods We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients diagnosed with PT, TSS, and SSWAs who underwent transvenous endovascular treatment between September 2020 and January 2024. The primary outcome was treatment success at 3 months, defined as complete resolution of baseline PT. Secondary outcomes included treatment success at 24 hours and 1 year, PT recurrence within 1 year, and major complications.Results Thirty-three patients with PT, TSS, and SSWAs underwent 38 procedures. Among these, 14 cases (36.8%) had dehiscence alone, 3 cases (7.9%) with diverticulum alone, and 20 cases (52.6%) involved both dehiscence and diverticulum. Stenting alone was performed in 25 cases (65.8%), stent-assisted coiling in 9 cases (23.7%), and coiling alone in 4 cases (10.5%). The primary outcome of complete resolution of PT at 3 months was achieved in 86.1% (31/36) of cases, with partial resolution in an additional 13.9% (5/36) of cases. There was no difference in outcomes between cases of isolated stenting and those involving coiling or stent-assisted coiling.Conclusion Transverse sinus stenting alone, without dedicated treatment of SSWAs, resolves PT in patients with TSS and SSWAs. These results support the growing evidence that SSWAs are secondary to TSS in patients with PT and/or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, suggesting that additional interventions like coiling or surgery of SSWAs may be unnecessary.

TI Establishment of a blunt impact-induced brain injury model in rabbits
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF TRAUMATOLOGY
AB Objective: To establish an animal model to replicate the blunt impact brain injury in forensic medicine.
   Methods: Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into control group (n=4), minor injury group (n=10) and severe injury group (n=10). Based on the BIM-II Horizontal Bio-impact Machine, self-designed iron bar was used to produce blunt brain injury. Two rabbits from each injury group were randomly selected to monitor the change of intracranial pressure (ICP) during the impacting process by pressure microsensors. Six hours after injury, all the rabbits were dissected to observe the injury morphology and underwent routine pathological examination.
   Results: Varying degrees of nervous system positive signs were observed in all the injured rabbits. Within 6 hours, the mortality rate was 1/10 in the minor injury group and 6/10 in the severe injury group. Morphological changes consisted of different levels of scalp hematoma, skull fracture, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage and brain injury. At the moment of hitting, the ICP was greater in severe injury group than in mild injury group; and within the same group, the impact side showed positive pressure while the opposite side showed negative pressure.
   Conclusions: Under the rigidly-controlled experimental condition, this animal model has a good reproducibility and stable results. Meanwhile, it is able to simulate themorphology of iron strike-induced injury, thus can be used to study the mechanism of blunt head injury in forensic medicine.

TI Effect of hyperventilation on regional cerebral blood flow in
   head-injured children
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objectives: To study cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption in severe head-injured children and also to assess the effect of hyperventilation on regional cerebral blood flow,
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Pediatric intensive care unit at a tertiary-level university children's hospital.
   Patients: Twenty-three children with isolated severe brain injury, whose admission Glasgow Coma Scores were <8.
   Interventions: Paco(2) was adjusted by altering minute ventilation, Cerebral metabolic measurements were made at three levels of Paco(2) (>35, 25 to 35, and <25 torr [>4.7, 3.3 to 4.7, and <3.3 kPa]) after allowing 15 mins for equilibrium.
   Measurements and Main Results: Thirty eight studies (each study consisting of three sets of measurements at different levels of Paco(2)) were performed on 23 patients, At each level of Paco(2), the following measurements were made: xenon-enhanced computed tomography scans; cerebral blood flow; intracranial pressure; jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation; mean arterial pressure; and arterial oxygen saturation, Derived variables included: cerebral oxygen consumption; cerebral perfusion pressure; and oxygen extraction ratio, Cerebral blood flow decreased below normal after head injury (mean 49.6 +/- 14.6 mL/min/100 g). Cerebral oxygen consumption decreased out of proportion to the decrease in cerebral blood flow; cerebral oxygen consumption was only a third of the normal range (mean 1.02 +/- 0.59 mL/min/100 g). Neither cerebral blood flow nor cerebral oxygen consumption showed any relationship to time after injury, Glasgow Coma Score at the time of presentation, or intracranial pressure, The frequency of one or more regions of ischemia (defined as cerebral blood flow of <18 mL/min/ 100 g) was 28.9% during normocapnia, This value increased to 73.1% for Paco(2) at <25 torr.
   Conclusions: Severe head injury in children produced a modest decrease in cerebral blood flow but a much larger decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption, Absolute hyperemia was uncommon at any time, but measured cerebral blood flow rates were still above the metabolic requirements of most children, The clear relationship between the frequency of cerebral ischemia and hypocarbia, combined with the rarity of hyperemia, suggests that hyperventilation should be used with caution and monitored carefully in children with severe head injuries.

TI MENINGIOMAS OF THE APEX OF THE TENTORIAL INCISURA - DIAGNOSIS AND
   SURGICAL-TREATMENT - REPORT OF 7 CASES
SO NEUROCHIRURGIE
AB Seven cases of meningiomas implanted on the medial portion of the free edge of the tentorium are reported.  The denomination << meningiomas of the apex of the tentorial incisura >> is proposed.  In 4 patients, the clinical presentation was that of an intracranial hypertension without signs of compression of the quadrigeminal plate involvement.  In the other 3 patients, the initial symptoms were those of the triad of the adult chronic hydrocephalus (N.P.H.) syndrome.  Angiographic evaluation provides useful informations on the arterial supply (which is mainly from the tentorial branches of the internal carotid arteries and occasionnaly from the middle meningeal arteries) and the relationships of the tumor with the deep venous system.  C.T. and M.R.I. facilitate earlier diagnosis and better demonstration of implantation and extension of the tumor, which the selection of a surgical approach is based upon.  Four patients have undergone an occipital supratentorial approach and 2 a supra-cerebellar infra-tentorial approach.  The meningioma was totally removed in 5 patients, sub-totally in 1 to avoid bilateral lesions of the visual pathways and cortical areas.  The 7th patient was treated by C.S.F. shunt alone.  No operative mortality occurred.  The follow-up is averaging 18 months:  4 patients are symptom-free, 3 exhibit minor sequelae (epilepsy:  1, visual field defects:  2, memory impairement:  2).  Six patients of the series have resumed their previous activities.  Discussion is focused on the difficulties of surgical removal of this particular type of tentorial meningioma, resulting from volume, implantation and relationships of the tumor with the deep veins.  Preoperative assessment of the thrombosis of the great vein of Galen and of the straight sinus is essential when considering a radical resection of the tumor which should logically include the anterior third of the falco-tentorial junction.

TI Clinical research on postoperative efficacy and related factors of early
   simulation hyperbaric oxygen therapy for severe craniocerebral injury
SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB In order to discuss the clinical efficacy of simulation hyperbaric oxygen therapy(HBOT) for severe craniocerebral injury and analyze the related factors of it, 108 patients who transferred to our department during December 2010 - December 2014 for ventilator treatment after operation of severe craniocerebral injury were taken as the subjects of the study. These patients were divided into conventional treatment group and simulation hyperbaric oxygen therapy group to contrast the curative effects. At the meantime, GOS score and length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) of two groups 6 months after treatment, as well as changes in the indexes of the HBO group during treatment were performed statistical analysis. Then factors affecting prognosis of simulation HBOT were performed regression analysis and principal component analysis. The results showed that when compared to the control group, differences in cases with four GOS score and one GOS score in the treatment group were significant (p<0.05). Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2), jugular bulb oxygen partial pressure (PjO2), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of the simulation HBO group before the first time treatment on the first day and after the first time treatment on the third day were significantly increased, with statistical significance (p<0.05); serum lactic acid (Lac) and blood glucose (Glu) decreased significantly (p<0.05). Prior to and during the first treatment on the first day, jugular bulb pressure (Pj) and central venous pressure (CVP) had no significant difference (p>0.05). Regression analysis indicated that factors affecting prognosis included cerebral contusion, coronary heart disease, hydrocephalus and tracheotomy. Principal component analysis found the factors were hydrocephalus, coronary heart disease, tracheotomy, cerebral contusion, cerebral infarction and glasgow coma scale (GCS) before treatment. Therefore, stimulation HBOT can significantly improve the prognosis of patients with severe craniocerebral injury. Paying attention to risk factors in clinics and giving timely interventional treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality in patients.

TI MENINGIOMAS ARISING FROM THE FALCOTENTORIAL JUNCTION -
   CLINICAL-FEATURES, NEUROIMAGING STUDIES, AND SURGICAL-TREATMENT
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Meningiomas arising from the falcotentorial junction are extremely rare. The authors describe the clinical features, neuroimaging studies, and results of surgical treatment of meningiomas of the falcotentorial junction and clarify the characteristics of this lesion based on a review of the literature and seven patients treated at their institution. The most common symptoms resulted from intracranial hypertension. Upward-gaze palsy appeared in only one patient. Computerized tomography (CT) showed no specific findings, but there was no evidence of edema around the tumor. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a round, smooth-bordered mass with a peritumoral rim, without edema, and showing marked contrast enhancement. The multiplanar capability of MR imaging delineated the relationship between the tumor and adjacent structures better than did CT. Detailed knowledge of the vascular structures, especially evidence of occlusion of the galenic venous system and the development of collateral venous channels, is critical for successful surgery; stereoscopic cerebral angiography is necessary to achieve this aim.
   The seven patients described developed five types of collateral venous channels: through the basal, vein of Rosenthal to the petrosal vein, through the veins on the medial surface of the parietal and occipital lobes to the superior sagittal sinus, through superficial anastomotic veins, through veins of the posterior fossa to the transverse or straight sinus, and through the falcian veins to the superior sagittal sinus. The first three types mainly developed after occlusion of the galenic system. The tumors were removed through the occipital transtentorial approach with a large window at the posterior part of the falx. A favorable prognosis for patients undergoing surgical treatment of falcotentorial junction meningiomas can be expected if detailed neuroimaging studies and microsurgical techniques are used.

TI Spontaneous intracranial hypotension resulting in coma: Case report
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a potentially severe condition characterized by a distinct clinical picture caused by low cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Although coma has been reported previously as a presentation of this condition, this is the first report in which misdiagnosis of this condition and unwarranted surgery led to coma.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old man presented with a history of headache, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral chronic subdural hematomas. After evacuation of the hematoma, the patient's condition deteriorated into a state of profound depression of consciousness. Repeated cranial computed tomographic scarfs showed intracranial air, and intracranial pressure monitoring showed negative recording. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated epidural cerebrospinal fluid leaks at the middle and lower thoracic levels.
   INTERVENTION: Epidural blood patch resulted in almost immediate improvement in the patient's condition, and the was fully awake 24 hours later.
   CONCLUSION: This case report expands the presently known clinical spectrum of this uncommon and generally benign illness.

TI Evaluation of a hypertonic saline-dextran solution for treatment of dogs
   with shock induced by gastric dilatation-volvulus
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB Objective-To test the hypothesis that small volumes of hypertonic saline-dextran (HSD) solution can be used to effectively resuscitate dogs in shock induced by gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), and, compared with administration of large volumes of lactated Ringer's solution (IRS), can be used to limit the overall volume of fluid needed for resuscitation.
   Design-Prospective, clinical study,
   Animals-15 dogs with GDV-induced shock.
   Procedure-Initially, HSD solution (5 ml/kg of body weight) or IRS (60 to 90 ml/kg) was administered. Aii dogs then received a maintenance administration (20 ml/kg/h) of IRS. Cardiorespiratory, blood gas, and serum biochemical analyses were performed over a 4-hour period after initiation of treatment. Results-Systolic arterial and central venous pressures and plasma volume increased more rapidly in dogs in the HSD + IRS group, The cumulative dose of fluids administered to dogs in the HSD + IRS group was significantly less than that administered to dogs in the LRS group. Serum sodium and chloride concentrations and osmolarity increased significantly in dogs in the HSD; IRS group, but not in dogs in the LRS group. Ventricular arrhythmias were detected in both groups of dogs, but did not appear to be induced by either form of fluid therapy.
   Clinical Implications-Administration of HSD rapidly restored cardiorespiratory function and induced resuscitation equivalent to administration of large volumes of LRS. Use of HSD solutions to treat dogs in GDV-induced shock may be more efficient than use of isotonic fluids. Administration of HSD solution was not associated with noticeable complications.

TI Low-pressure hydrocephalus: indication for custom-made catheters?
   Technical report
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is characterized by ventriculomegaly with persistent low intracranial pressure (ICP). Sub-zero drainage is needed for its management and multiple solutions have been described. Our aim is to report our experience with custom-made peritoneal catheters with larger inner diameter as an alternative treatment option.
   We made a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with LPH and treated with custom-made peritoneal catheters at the Virgen del Rocio Pediatric Neurosurgical Unit. Catheters were coated with antibiotic or silver. The inner diameter of ventricular catheters was 1.4 mm; peritoneal catheters were larger than usual (1.9 mm inner diameter).
   We identified four patients in whom five custom-made peritoneal catheters were used over a 3-year period. There were two males and the mean age was 10 years (6 months-17 years). In all patients, placement of an EVD was necessary for sub-zero drainage, with maximum negative pressure of -8 cm H20. The mean time of maintenance of EVD was 102 days (10 days-1 year). Finally, three ventriculoperitoneal (VP) valveless systems, one with antigravitation device, and one Pro-GAV VP shunt were placed, all of them with larger custom-made peritoneal catheters. After a mean follow-up period of 2.3 years (6 months-3 years), two patients are completely recovered, one patient is partially dependent for daily activities with good cognitive status, and the last one is a child who died due to his brain tumor.
   The custom-made peritoneal catheters with larger inner diameter could be a good option for the management of this complex pathology.

TI ABDOMINAL CSF PSEUDOCYSTS IN PATIENTS WITH VENTRICULO-PERITONEAL SHUNTS
   - REPORT OF 14 CASES AND REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB The abdominal intraperitoneal cerebrospinal fluid pseudocyst is an infrequent but important complication in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Since 1954, 115 cases of paediatric pseudocysts have been reported in the literature. One additional report deals with an adult patient.
   We report on 14 cases of sonographically diagnosed abdominal pseudocysts. Their aetiology, diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms and surgical management are investigated. In our hydrocephalus series we have an incidence of pseudocyst formation of 4,5%. The most common presentation of the paediatric patients is with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure and abdominal pain, whereas the adults have predominantly local abdominal signs. Diagnosis is readily made with ultrasonography. Predisposing factors for pseudocyst formation are multiple shunt revisions and infection. Microscopically, the pseudocysts consist of fibrous tissue without epithelial lining. The treatment involves surgical removal of the catheter with or without excision of the pseudocyst wall and placement of a new catheter intraperitoneally in a different quadrant or an intra-atrial shunt. Recurrences are rare, especially under appropriate medical treatment of infection. In our series, microbiologically proven infection was present in 30% of the cases.

TI Evaluation of an anaesthetic technique used in dogs undergoing
   craniectomy for tumour resection
SO VETERINARY ANAESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB Objective To evaluate a total intravenous anaesthetic technique in dogs undergoing craniectomy.
   Study design Prospective clinical study.
   Animals Ten dogs admitted for elective surgical resection of rostro-tentorial tumours.
   Methods All dogs were premedicated with methadone, 0.2 mg kg(-1) intramuscularly 30 minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol administered intravenously (IV) to effect, following administration of lidocaine 1 mg kg(-1) IV and maintained with a continuous infusion of propofol at <= 0.4 mg kg(-1) minute(-1) during instrumentation and preparation and during movement of the animals to recovery. During surgery, anaesthesia was maintained using a continuous infusion of propofol at <= 0.4 mg kg(-1) minute(-1) and alfentanil <= 1 mu g kg(-1) minute(-1). Lidocaine was administered at 1 mg kg(-1) IV immediately prior to extubation. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were recorded prior to induction and every 5 minutes throughout preparation and surgery. Central venous pressure was recorded every 5 minutes throughout surgery.
   Results Administration of propofol and lidocaine prevented significant increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and HR during endotracheal intubation and extubation. Adequate MAP was maintained throughout anaesthesia. Recovery was smooth and excitement free. There was no association between duration of anaesthesia, total drugs administered, or severity of neurological disease and recovery times. Postoperatively there was no deterioration in neurological function in the immediate postoperative period with complete resolution of pre-existing neurological deficits within 7 days of surgery.
   Conclusion This technique provided minimal response to intubation and extubation, adequate arterial blood pressure and a smooth predictable recovery. All animals were neurologically improved by the time of discharge, suggesting that this technique had not caused significant neuronal damage.
   Clinical relevance Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and alfentanil appears to be a satisfactory anaesthetic technique for use in dogs undergoing surgery for debulking/removal of rostro-tentorial tumours.

TI Prevention and control of postoperative nausea and vomiting in
   post-craniotomy patients
SO BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH-CLINICAL ANAESTHESIOLOGY
AB Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are the most frequent side-effects in the postoperative period, impairing subjective well-being and having economic impact due to delayed discharge. However, emetic symptoms can also cause major medical complications, and post-craniotomy patients may be at an increased risk. A review and critical appraisal of the existing literature on PONV in post-craniotomy patients, and a comparison of these findings with the current knowledge on PONV in the general surgical population, leads to the following conclusions: (1) Despite the lack of a documented case of harm caused by retching or vomiting in a post-craniotomy patient, the potential risk caused by arterial hypertension and high intra-abdominal/intra-thoracic pressure leading to high intracranial pressure, forces to avoid PONV in these patients. (2) There is unclarity about a specifically increased (or decreased) risk for PONV in post-craniotomy patients compared with other surgical procedures. (3) The decision whether or not to administer an antiemetic should not be based primarily on risk scores for PONV but on the likelihood for potential catastrophic consequences of PONV. If such a risk cannot be ruled out, a multimodal antiemetic approach should be considered regardless of the individual risk. (4) Randomized controlled trials with antiemetics in post-craniotomy patients are limited with respect to sample size and methodological quality. This also impacts upon the meaning of meta-analyses performed with trials that showed marked heterogeneity and inconclusive results. (5) No studies on the treatment of established PONV are available. This highlights the need to transfer knowledge about PONV treatment from other surgical procedures. (6) Despite the possibility that PONV in post-craniotomy patients can be triggered by specific conditions (e.g. surgery near the area postrema at the floor of the fourth ventricle with the vomiting centre located nearby), recommendations based on trials in post-craniotomy patients may be flawed. Thus, general knowledge on prevention and treatment of PONV must adopted for craniotomy settings.

TI Lumboperitoneal shunt for the treatment of pseudotumor cerebri
SO NEUROLOGY
AB We conducted a retrospective study of 27 patients with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) treated with at least one lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS) to ascertain the efficacy oi. this treatment. The average duration of follow-up for this population was 77 months (median, 47 months), with a range of 21 to 278 months. A functioning LPS was successful in alleviating symptoms in all patients studied, and no patient with a functioning shunt complained of shunt-related symptoms, such as low-pressure headache or abdominal pain, within 2 months after the shunt was performed. Twelve patients (44%) required no revisions. The number of revisions among the 15 patients (56%) who required them ranged horn 1 (5 patients) to 13 (1 patient). Three of these patients required 35 of the 66 total shunt revisions (53%). There were no major complications from LPS, other than failure of the shunt, even in patients who required multiple shunts. We conclude that placement of a lumboperitoneal shunt is satisfactory treatment for the majority of patients with PTC who require surgical therapy for the disorder, even though some patients ultimately require multiple shunt revisions.

TI Intracranial Venous Reflux Caused by Occlusion of the Brachiocephalic
   Vein Mimicking Dural Arteriovenous Fistula
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: High signal intensity of cerebral venous sinuses on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) indicates high flow of shunt from arterial blood, suggesting dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF). Herein, we describe the cases of 2 patients with intracranial venous reflux caused by brachiocephalic vein occlusion (BVO) mimicking dAVF on MRA.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1 was a 71-year-old woman who had received arteriovenous graft (AVG) surgery for hemodialysis and presented with headache. MRA depicted high signal intensities in the left jugular vein, inferior petrosal sinus, and ophthalmic vein suggesting intracranial dAVF. However, cerebral angiography revealed intracranial venous reflux through the jugular vein caused by BVO. After balloon angioplasty with stenting for BVO, normal venous drainage was restored and her symptoms resolved. Case 2 was a 62-year-old woman who had received AVG for hemodialysis and was hospitalized due to seizure. MRA revealed high signal intensities of the left transverse-sigmoid sinus and jugular vein, and it was suspected that they were associated with BVO. She did not receive immediate intervention because of her septic condition. The patient ultimately died of fatal intracranial hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: Central venous occlusion may occur in patients with end-stage renal disease who are receiving AVG for hemodialysis. Intracranial venous reflux resulting from BVO can induce various neurologic disorders including intracranial venous hypertension or hemorrhage. Prompt recognition and implementation of endovascular treatment can be beneficial in cases of symptomatic central venous occlusion.

TI Microelectromechanical Systems and Nephrology: The Next Frontier in
   Renal Replacement Technology
SO ADVANCES IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE
AB Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are playing a prominent role in the development of many new and innovative biomedical devices, but they remain a relatively underused technology in nephrology. The future landscape of clinical medicine and research will only see further expansion of MEMS-based technologies in device designs and applications. This enthusiasm stems from the ability to create small-scale device features with high precision in a cost-effective manner. MEMS also offers the possibility to integrate multiple components into a single device. The adoption of MEMS has the potential to revolutionize how nephrologists manage kidney disease by improving the delivery of renal replacement therapies and enhancing the monitoring of physiologic parameters. To introduce nephrologists to MEMS, this review will first define relevant terms and describe the basic processes used to fabricate devices. Next, a survey of MEMS devices being developed for various biomedical applications will be illustrated with current examples. Finally, MEMS technology specific to nephrology will be highlighted and future applications will be examined. The adoption of MEMS offers novel avenues to improve the care of kidney disease patients and assist nephrologists in clinical practice. This review will serve as an introduction for nephrologists to the exciting world of MEMS. (C) 2013 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS): a review of
   proposed mechanisms and analogs
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Introduction: Over the last decade, many neuro-ocular findings have been documented following long-duration spaceflight (LDSF) including optic disc edema, choroidal folds, hyperopic refractive shift, and cotton wool spots. These are currently classified under the term Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS). SANS is unique to space flight with no direct terrestrial analog. The exact pathogenesis is a subject of much debate and poses questions about the long-term impact of SANS on future human spaceflight missions.
   Areas Covered: In this review, we explore the current understanding of SANS including the different proposed etiologies and comparable terrestrial analogs. A systematic but selective review of literature published about SANS and related ocular diseases was conducted. Databases searched include PubMed and Scopus. This information was used to generate a review on potential mechanisms and analogs related to SANS.
   Expert Opinion: This review discusses the current status and future directions for SANS research, the role private space companies play in increasing access to space flight, and the possibility of future high-quality human spaceflight research in microgravity. We hope that the work on SANS can inspire technological innovation, increase our knowledge of terrestrial disorders, and possibly creating downstream spin-off technologies that have wider applications beyond space flight alone.

TI Z FLOW HYDROCEPHALUS SHUNT, A NEW APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF
   HYDROCEPHALUS, THE RATIONALE BEHIND ITS DESIGN AND THE INITIAL RESULTS
   OF PRESSURE MONITORING AFTER Z FLOW SHUNT IMPLANTATION
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB The over-drainage of CSF after shunt implantation, particularly when the patient is in the vertical posture, is well documented. Problems associated with it are negative pressure syndrome (postural headache and postural irritability), abnormal skull size, craniosynostosis and subdural haematoma. The pressure gradient in the vertical position between the cranial cavity and the right atrium is 15 to 20 cm of water and between the cranial and peritoneal cavity it is 25 to 32 cm of water and both these are much higher than those needed for the optimum functioning of a conventional shunt. The need, therefore, has been for a self-regulating device that can adjust itself to any change of posture from horizontal to vertical and vice versa and regulate the flow of CSF from the cranial cavity. ''Z'' Flow hydrocephalus shunt system has this in-built self-regulating mechanism to prevent over drainage of CSF and the resultant abnormal low pressure in the cranial cavity.
   The rationale behind the functioning of ''Z'' Flow hydrocephalus shunt system has been discussed, its design has been described and illustrated and the results of pressure monitoring after Z Flow shunt implantation in five adult patients have been detailed. As the opening pressures of the ''Z'' Flow shunt system are 15-29 cm of water, it has been found to prevent over-drainage of CSF and maintain intraventricular pressure within normal limits.

TI Mechanical versus humoral determinants of brain death-induced lung
   injury
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   The mechanisms of brain death (BD)-induced lung injury remain incompletely understood, as uncertainties persist about time-course and relative importance of mechanical and humoral perturbations.
   Methods
   Brain death was induced by slow intracranial blood infusion in anesthetized pigs after randomization to placebo (n = 11) or to methylprednisolone (n = 8) to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), wedged PAP (PAWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and effective pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) were measured 1 and 5 hours after Cushing reflex. Lung tissue was sampled to determine gene expressions of cytokines and oxidative stress molecules, and pathologically score lung injury.
   Results
   Intracranial hypertension caused a transient increase in blood pressure followed, after brain death was diagnosed, by persistent increases in PAP, PCP and the venous component of PVR, while PAWP did not change. Arterial PO2/fraction of inspired O-2 (PaO2/FiO(2)) decreased. Brain death was associated with an accumulation of neutrophils and an increased apoptotic rate in lung tissue together with increased pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6/IL-10 ratio and increased heme oxygenase(HO)-1 and hypoxia inducible factor(HIF)-1 alpha expression. Blood expressions of IL-6 and IL-1 beta were also increased. Methylprednisolone pre-treatment was associated with a blunting of increased PCP and PVR venous component, which returned to baseline 5 hours after BD, and partially corrected lung tissue biological perturbations. PaO2/FiO(2) was inversely correlated to PCP and lung injury score.
   Conclusions
   Brain death-induced lung injury may be best explained by an initial excessive increase in pulmonary capillary pressure with increased pulmonary venous resistance, and was associated with lung activation of inflammatory apoptotic processes which were partially prevented by methylprednisolone.

TI Ventriculosinus shunt: a pilot study to investigate new technology to
   treat hydrocephalus and mimic physiological principles of cerebrospinal
   fluid drainage
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE Devices draining CSF to the intracranial venous sinus for the treatment of hydrocephalus have been tested in the past, and while clinically effective, have not shown efficacy in the long term. The majority of these devices become obstructed within 3 months due to endothelial overgrowth. In this study, the authors investigated a newly developed ventriculosinus (VS) shunt outlet device with the objective of showing it would remain patent for at least 6 months. METHODS Twelve patients in need of shunting for hydrocephalus underwent an operation using the investigational device and were followed for 6 months to record patency of the shunt. RESULTS In 10 patients, the shunt was patent at 6 months, with the outlet device remaining unobstructed. In the remaining 2 patients, one died just before reaching the 6-month endpoint, and in the other the outlet was misplaced during surgery and therefore ceased to function after 3 months. No occlusion of the internal jugular vein or thrombus formation was noted in any of the 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that the outlet device can remain patent and has the capability to mimic physiological drainage by diverting CSF to the intracranial sinus. Additional confirmation of its potential as part of a new VS shunt system and ultimately as a viable alternative for ventriculoperitoneal and ventriculoatrial shunting to reduce complication rates requires further clinical trials.

SO INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE AND NEUROMONITORING IN BRAIN INJURY
SE ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA SUPPLEMENTA
CT 10th International ICP Symposium
CY MAY 25-29, 1997
CL WILLIAMSBURG, VA
AB Laboratory studies suggest the pulsatile component of the transcranial doppler (TCD) waveform may be useful in determining lower autoregulatory threshold. This study aimed to assess the effect of increasing CPP on jugular bulb oximetry (SjO(2)) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) TCD Bow velocities in the early management of severe head injury.
   16 severely head injured patients (GCS less than or equal to 8), had intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure, SjO(2) and MCA Doppler velocity monitored continuously. CPP was increased by intravenous fluids (right atrial pressure congruent to 10) and supplemented with adrenaline infusion until TCD pulsatility (Gosling pulsatility index [PI]) reached a plateau.
   The mean CPP at which SjO(2) surpassed 55% was 62 +/- 6.2 mm Hg. TCD PI did not plateau until a significantly higher mean CPP of 74 +/- 5.1 mm Hg was achieved (p < 0.01). In 8 cases, increased CPP was associated with a fall in ICP. ranging from 1 to 8 mm Hg.
   We conclude that a critically low level of SjO(2) is a late indicator of failed autoregulation. CPP values associated with intact autoregulation identified by TCD assessment of MCA flow are significantly higher than those indicated by SjO(2) monitoring. MCA Doppler flow assessment may be useful in determining the level of CPP at which therapy should be aimed in the early resuscitation of head trauma.

TI A comprehensive review of pediatric endotracheal suctioning: Effects,
   indications, and clinical practice
SO PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: To provide a comprehensive, evidence-based review of pediatric endotracheal suctioning: effects, indications, and clinical practice.
   Methods: PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) electronic databases were searched for English language articles, published between 1962 and June 2007. Owing to the paucity of objective pediatric data, all reports dealing with this topic were examined, including adult and neonatal studies.
   Results: One hundred eighteen references were included in the final review. Despite the widespread use of endotracheal suctioning, very little high-level evidence dealing with pediatric endotracheal suctioning exists. Studies of mechanically ventilated neonatal, pediatric, and adult patients have shown that suctioning causes a range of potentially serious complications. Current practice guidelines are not based on evidence from controlled clinical trials. There is no clear evidence that endotracheal suctioning improves respiratory mechanics, with most studies pointing to the detrimental effect it has on lung mechanics. Suctioning should be performed when obstructive secretions are present rather than routinely. There is no clear evidence for the superiority of closed-or open-system suctioning, nor is there clear evidence for appropriate vacuum pressures and suction catheter size. Sterility does not seem to be necessary when suctioning. Preoxygenation has short-term benefits, but the longer-term impact is unknown. Routine saline instillation before suctioning should not be performed. Recruitment maneuvers performed after suctioning have not been shown to be useful as standard practice.
   Conclusions: Endotracheal suctioning is a procedure used regularly in the pediatric intensive care unit. Despite this, good evidence supporting its practice is limited. Further, controlled clinical studies are needed to develop evidence-based protocols for endotracheal suctioning of infants and children, and to examine the impact of different suctioning techniques on the duration of ventilatory support, incidence of nosocomial infection, and length of pediatric intensive care unit and hospital stay.

TI Inspiration Is the Major Regulator of Human CSF Flow
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB The mechanisms behind CSF flow in humans are still not fully known. CSF circulates from its primary production sites at the choroid plexus through the brain ventricles to reach the outer surface of the brain in the subarachnoid spaces from where it drains into venous bloodstream and cervical lymphatics. According to a recent concept of brain fluid transport, established in rodents, CSF from the brain surface also enters the brain tissue along para-arterial routes and exits through paravenous spaces again into subarachnoid compartments. This unidirectional flow is mainly driven by arterial pulsation. To investigate how CSF flow is regulated in humans, we applied a novel real-time magnetic resonance imaging technique at high spatial (0.75 mm) and temporal (50 ms) resolution in healthy human subjects. We observed significant CSF flow exclusively with inspiration. In particular, during forced breathing, high CSF flow was elicited during every inspiration, whereas breath holding suppressed it. Only a minor flow component could be ascribed to cardiac pulsation. The present results unambiguously identify inspiration as the most important driving force for CSF flow in humans. Inspiratory thoracic pressure reduction is expected to directly modulate the hydrostatic pressure conditions for the low-resistance paravenous, venous, and lymphatic clearance routes of CSF. Furthermore, the experimental approach opens new clinical opportunities to study the pathophysiology of various forms of hydrocephalus and to design therapeutic strategies in relation to CSF flow alterations.

TI Pseudohypoxic brain swelling: A newly defined complication after
   uneventful brain surgery, probably related to suction drainage
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: This is the first description of a severe and sometimes fatal complication after uneventful intracranial surgery. The clinical presentation and imaging features mimic those of global cerebral hypoxia. Extensive investigations were performed to discover the pathogenesis.
   METHODS: Seventeen cases of pseudohypoxic brain swelling (PHBS) were collected from our institution and from various other neurosurgical departments and were studied for common features. PHBS can occur in a mild, moderate, or severe degree. It is characterized by a very early postoperative onset of clinical deterioration (clouded or lost consciousness and pupillary abnormalities), in association with typical bilateral computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging changes (hypodensities or altered intensities in the basal ganglia and/or thalamus). The following variables were considered: age, primary pathological lesion and intracranial location, previous cranial surgery, anesthetic risk, type of anesthesia, approach and duration of surgery, intraoperative observations, technical monitoring results, and blood gas analyses. The results of postoperative computed tomography and various other imaging studies, intracranial pressure measurements, transcranial Doppler sonography, toxicological analyses, brain and muscle biopsies, and autopsies were also considered in the investigation. Several countermeasures were instituted and evaluated.
   RESULTS: Anoxemic and ischemic hypoxia was excluded as a cause of PHBS. No evidence was found for inhibition of the respiratory chain, mitochondriopathy, poisoning, or adverse effects of drugs.
   CONCLUSION: Indications of intracranial hypotension, induced by suction drainage, being the main pathomechanism of PHBS are discussed. A serious warning is issued regarding the use of suction drainage after intracranial surgery.

TI Late presentation of dural tears: Two case reports and review of
   literature
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
AB BACKGROUND The late presentation of dural tears (LPDT) has a low incidence rate and hidden symptoms and is easily ignored in clinical practice. If the disease is not treated in time, a series of complications may occur, including low intracranial pressure headache, infection, pseudodural cyst formation, and sinus formation. Here, we describe two cases of LPDT.CASE SUMMARY Two patients had sudden fever 1 wk after lumbar surgery. Physical examination showed obvious tenderness in the operation area. The patients were confirmed as having LPDT by lumbar magnetic resonance imaging and surgical exploration. One case was caused by continuous negative pressure suction and malnutrition, and the other was caused by decreased dural ductility and low postoperative nutritional status. The first symptom of both patients was fever, with occasional headache. Both patients underwent secondary surgery to treat the LPDT. Dural defects were observed and dural sealants were used to seal the dural defects, then drainage tubes were retained for drainage. After the operation, the patients were treated with antibiotics and the patients' surgical incisions healed well, without fever or incision tenderness. Both recovered and were discharged 1 wk after the operation.CONCLUSION LPDT is a rare complication of spinal surgery or neurosurgery that has hidden symptoms and can easily be overlooked. Since it may cause a series of complications, LPDT needs to be actively addressed in clinical practice.

TI Space physiology IV: mathematical modeling of the cardiovascular system
   in space exploration
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Mathematical modeling represents an important tool for analyzing cardiovascular function during spaceflight. This review describes how modeling of the cardiovascular system can contribute to space life science research and illustrates this process via modeling efforts to study postflight orthostatic intolerance (POI), a key issue for spaceflight. Examining this application also provides a context for considering broader applications of modeling techniques to the challenges of bioastronautics. POI, which affects a large fraction of astronauts in stand tests upon return to Earth, presents as dizziness, fainting and other symptoms, which can diminish crew performance and cause safety hazards. POI on the Moon or Mars could be more critical. In the field of bioastronautics, POI has been the dominant application of cardiovascular modeling for more than a decade, and a number of mechanisms for POI have been investigated. Modeling approaches include computational models with a range of incorporated factors and hemodynamic sophistication, and also physical models tested in parabolic and orbital flight. Mathematical methods such as parameter sensitivity analysis can help identify key system mechanisms. In the case of POI, this could lead to more effective countermeasures. Validation is a persistent issue in modeling efforts, and key considerations and needs for experimental data to synergistically improve understanding of cardiovascular responses are outlined. Future directions in cardiovascular modeling include subject-specific assessment of system status, as well as research on integrated physiological responses, leading, for instance, to assessment of subject-specific susceptibility to POI or effects of cardiovascular alterations on muscular, vision and cognitive function.

TI Combined Arterial and Venous Phase Computed Tomographic Imaging of the
   Skull Base in Pulsatile Tinnitus
SO OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY
AB Objective To describe the demographic, clinical, and radiologic findings in a consecutive series of patients presenting with a chief complaint of pulsatile tinnitus (PT). Study Design Retrospective review of 157 patients undergoing a combined arterial/venous phase computed tomographic (CT) imaging study. Setting Tertiary referral center. Patients Adult patients referred to neurotology faculty for evaluation of PT between 2016 and 2020. Interventions Triple phase high-resolution arteriography/venography/temporal bone CT. Main Outcome Measures Prevalence of osseous, venous, and/or arterial pathology, clinicodemographic characteristics. Results One hundred fifty-seven adults (mean age, 52 years; 79.6% female) were evaluated. A history of migraine headaches was common (19.7%). The average body mass index was 30.0 (standard deviation, 6.8), and 17.2% of subjects had a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension was diagnosed by elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture in 13.4%. Comorbid depression and anxiety were common (25.5% and 26.1%, respectively). Overall, abnormalities were found in 79.0% of scans, with bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) seen in 38.9% and unilateral TSS found in 20.4%. Fifteen subjects (9.6%) had evidence of osseous etiologies, including superior canal dehiscence or thinning in 8.9% and sigmoid sinus dehiscence in one subject. There were 3 dural arteriovenous fistulae identified. Unilateral PT was ipsilateral to the side of TSS in 84.4% of subjects with unilateral TSS. Conclusion In a large consecutive series of patients with PT referred for CT venography/arteriography, transverse sinus stenosis was the most common finding at 59%. Venous etiologies for PT should be suspected when patients are referred to neurotologists for evaluation.

TI Risk factors for complications during intracranial electrode recording
   in presurgical evaluation of drug resistant partial epilepsy
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Intracranial electrode monitoring is still required in epilepsy surgery; however, it is associated with significant morbidity.
   To identify risk factors associated with complications during invasive intracranial EEG monitoring.
   Retrospective study of all patients undergoing invasive monitoring at Westmead between 1988-2004. From detailed chart reviews, the following variables were recorded: duration of intracranial monitoring, the site of grid implantation, number of grids and electrodes, seizure frequency, postoperative complications and seizure outcome.
   Seventy-one patients (median age: 24 years) underwent subdural electrode implantation; 62% had extratemporal lobe epilepsy and 46% were non-lesional. Of the 58 monitored patients who had cortical resections, 45 had good seizure outcomes. Complications related to subdural electrode implantation included transient complications requiring no treatment (12.7%), transient complications requiring treatment (9.9%) and two deaths (2.8%). Specific complications included subdural haemorrhage, transient neurological deficit, infarction and osteomyelitis. The two deaths occurred within 48 h of implantation were related to raised intracranial pressure (one venous infarction, one unexplained). Complications were associated with maximal size of grid (p < 0.001), greater number of electrodes (p < 0.001), electrode density per cortical surface implanted (p < 0.001), right central surface implantation (p = 0.003) and left central surface implantation (p = 0.013). Multiple logistic regression identified larger size grids and right central surface implantation as independent predictors of complications.
   There are significant complications during intracranial EEG evaluations but the majority of these are transient. We found a relationship between the size of the electrode arrays and the incidence of complications. The results of this study have been used to modify our implantation and monitoring protocols.

TI Response of cerebral oxygen metabolism in the head-up position during
   laparoscopic cholecystectomy
SO SURGICAL LAPAROSCOPY & ENDOSCOPY
AB To clarify the influence of the head-up position on cerebral oxygen metabolism during laparoscopy with CO2 insufflation in 12 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, changes in the concentrations of cerebral oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)), deoxyhemoglobin (Hb), total hemoglobin (total Hb) and oxidized cytochrome aa, (Cyt aa(3)) were measured by use of near-infrared laser spectroscopy. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide (66%), oxygen, and sevoflurane. Pneumoperitoneum was maintained at an intraabdominal pressure of 10-12 mm Hg by use of CO2. Minute ventilation was adjusted to maintain end-tidal CO2 tension (PETCO2) between 35 and 40 mm Hg during the procedure. Patients were moved from supine to the head-up (20 degrees) position before intraabdominal manipulation. The concentration of HbO(2) decreased significantly when patients were moved to the head-up position and 30 min thereafter. It remained significantly low after they were returned to thesupine position and at the end of surgery. The concentration of Hb was unchanged during the study. Therefore, the concentration of total Hb decreased significantly when patients were moved to the head-up position, as well as 30 min thereafter. It remained significantly low after they were returned to the supine position and at the end of surgery. The concentration of Cyt aa(3), however, did not change significantly during the study; These results suggest that the head-up position during laparoscopic cholecystectomy decreases cerebral HbO(2) and total Hb.

TI Management of Severe Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Using Mechanical
   Balloon Assisted Thrombectomy
SO STROKE-VASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL NEUROLOGY
AB Background Cerebral venous thrombosis is a devastating condition with, despite optimal medical management, a significant proportion deteriorating due to involvement of the deep venous system, worsening intracranial pressures, and hemorrhage. In this study, we report the characteristics, immediate and long-term outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) using a Forgarty balloon catheter among patients with cerebral venous thrombosis. Methods A prospective study conducted at the Christian Medical College, Vellore over 5 years (February 2017-February 2022), wherein patients with cerebral venous thrombosis who had clinical deterioration despite best medical management and requiring MT were included. MT was performed through retrograde venous access through internal jugular veins using a Fogarty balloon. The primary outcome was composite end point of mortality and proportion of patients with favorable clinical response at last follow-up, defined as a disability score in modified Rankin scale 0-2. Results Among 546 patients treated in our center during the study period, 57(10%), patients required MT. The median age of the study population was 33 years (interquartile range: 17-70 years) with equal gender predilection. Hemorrhagic venous infarction was seen in 28/57 (50%) patients. The mean duration between starting medical treatment and to MT was 43 hours (interquartile range: 5-260 hours) with the most common indication being clinical deterioration (70%). Five patients (9%) required decompressive hemicraniectomy. The mortality at discharge was 5% (n=3), and at last follow-up visit was 7% (n=4). Younger patients without hemorrhagic venous infarction and non-involvement of the frontoparietal lobes seem to benefit the most. Favorable functional outcome at discharge (modified Rankin scale 0-2) was seen in 65% which further improved to 77% at 1-year follow-up. Conclusion Balloon-assisted MT is safe and effective in a subset of patients with severe cerebral venous thrombosis, with clinical deterioration despite optimal medical management.

TI Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-C Treatment Enhances Cerebrospinal
   Fluid Outflow during<i> Toxoplasma</i><i> gondii</i> Brain Infection but
   Does Not Improve Cerebral Edema
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB Cerebral edema frequently develops in the setting of brain infection and can contribute to elevated intracranial pressure, a medical emergency. How excess fluid is cleared from the brain is not well understood. Previous studies have shown that interstitial fluid is transported out of the brain along perivascular channels that collect into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled subarachnoid space. CSF is then removed from the central nervous system through venous and lymphatic routes. The current study tested the hypothesis that increasing lymphatic drainage of CSF would promote clearance of cerebral edema fluid during infection with the neurotropic parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Fluorescent microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging was used to show that C57BL/6 mice develop vasogenic edema 4 to 5 weeks after infection with T. gondii. Tracer experiments were used to evaluate how brain infection affects meningeal lymphatic function, which demonstrated a decreased rate in CSF outflow in T. gondii- infected mice. Next, mice were treated with a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C-expressing viral vector, which induced meningeal lymphangiogenesis and improved CSF outflow in chronically infected mice. No difference in cerebral edema was observed between mice that received VEGF-C and those that rececived sham treatment. Therefore, although VEGF-C treatment can improve lymphatic outflow in mice infected with T. gondii, this effect does not lead to increased clearance of edema fluid from the brains of these mice.

TI Surgical treatment of pulsatile tinnitus related to the sigmoid sinus
SO JOURNAL OF OTOLOGY
AB Objective: Tinnitusda common clinical symptomdcan be categorized into pulsatile tinnitus (PT) and non-PT. Among these, PT is usually associated with sigmoid sinus symptoms, such as sigmoid sinus wall defect or diverticulum, for which various surgical treatments are available. We have discussed the clinical efficacy of surgery for sigmoid sinus-associated PT via the transmastoid approach in this study.Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 4 patients who underwent surgery for sigmoid sinusassociated PT via the transmastoid approach at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital from January to December 2020. Of these, 2 patients had sigmoid sinus wall defect and 2 had sigmoid sinus diverticulum. Postoperative tinnitus grading and surgical efficacy were determined.Results: After surgery, PT dissolved in 3 patients, while tinnitus significantly decreased in 1 patient. During the follow-up period of 12e18 months, none of the 4 patients showed complications related to increased intracranial pressure or venous sinus thrombosis, and tinnitus symptoms disappeared in 3 patients without recurrence, although 1 patient occasionally developed tinnitus. Postoperative thin-slice CTA of the temporal bone indicated that the sigmoid sinus bone wall defect or diverticulum was completely repaired with a thick soft tissue coverage.Conclusion: Surgical repair of sigmoid sinus-associated PT via the transmastoid approach deserves clinical promotion as it exhibited better efficiency while being relatively less invasive.(c) 2022 PLA General Hospital Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

TI IMPACT OF DIFFERENT VENTILATION STRATEGIES ON GAS EXCHANGES AND
   CIRCULATION DURING PROLONGED MECHANICAL CARDIO-PULMONARY RESUSCITATION
   IN A PORCINE MODEL
SO SHOCK
AB Background: Optimal ventilation during cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is still controversial. Ventilation is expected to provide sufficient arterial oxygen content and adequate carbon dioxide removal, while minimizing the risk of circulatory impairment. The objective of the present study was to compare three ventilation strategies in a porcine model during mechanical continuous chest compressions (CCC) according to arterial oxygenation and hemodynamic impact. Method: Ventricular fibrillation was induced and followed by five no-flow minutes and thirty low-flow minutes resuscitation with mechanical-CCC without vasopressive drugs administration. Three groups of eight Landras pig were randomized according to the ventilation strategy: 1. Standard nonsynchronized volume-control mode (SD-group); 2. synchronized bilevel pressure-controlled ventilation (CPV-group); 3. continuous insufflation with Boussignac Cardiac-Arrest Device (BC-group). We assessed 1. arterial blood gases, 2. macro hemodynamics, 3. tissular cerebral macro and micro-circulation and 4. airway pressure, minute ventilation at baseline and every 5 minutes during the protocol. Results: Arterial PaO2 level was higher at each measurement time in SD-group (>200 mm Hg) compare to CPV-group and BC-group (P< 0.01). In BC-group, arterial PaCO2 level was significantly higher (>90mm Hg) than in SD and CPV groups (P< 0.01). There was no difference between groups concerning hemodynamic parameters, cerebral perfusion and microcirculation. Conclusion: Ventilation modalities in this porcine model of prolonged CPR influence oxygenation and decarboxylation without impairing circulation and cerebral perfusion. Synchronized bi-level pressure-controlled ventilation' use avoid hyperoxia and was as efficient as asynchronized volume ventilation to maintain alveolar ventilation and systemic perfusion during prolonged CPR.

TI Management of hypertensive emergencies in acute brain disease:
   evaluation of the treatment effects of intravenous nicardipine on
   cerebral oxygenation Clinical article
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Object. Inappropriate sudden blood pressure (BP) reductions may adversely affect cerebral perfusion. This study explores the effect of nicardipine on regional brain tissue O-2 (PbtO(2)) during treatment of acute hypertensive emergencies.
   Methods. A prospective case-control Study was performed in 30 patients with neurological conditions and clinically elevated BP. All patients had a parenchymal PbtO(2) and intracranial pressure bolt inserted following resuscitation. Using a critical care guide, PbtO(2) was optimized. Intravenous nicardipine (5-15 mg/hour) was titrated to systolic BP < 160 mm Hg, diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg, mean arterial BP (MABP) 90-110 mg/Hg, and PbtO(2) > 20 mm Hg. Physiological parameters-intracranial pressure. PbtO(2), central venous pressure, systolic BP. diastolic BP, MABP, fraction of inspired O-2, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)-were compared before infusion, at 4 hours, and at 8 hours using a t-test.
   Results. Sixty episodes of hypertension were reported in 30 patients (traumatic brain injury in 13 patients: aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in 11: intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage in 3 and 1, respective]),: arteriovenous malformation in 1; and hypoxic brain injury ill 1). Nicardipine was effective in 87%, of the patients (with intravenous (3 blockers in 4 patients). with a 19.7% reduction in mean 4-hour MABP (115.3 +/- 13.1 mm Hg preinfusion vs 92.9 +/- 11.40 mm Hg after 4 hours of therapy. p < 0.001). No deleterious effect on mean PbtO(2) was recorded (26.74 +/- 15.42 mm Hg preinfusion vs 27.68 +/- 12.51 mm Hg after 4 hours of therapy, p = 0.883) despite significant reduction in CPP. Less dependence oil normobaric hyperoxia was achieved at 8 hours (0.72 +/- 0.299 mm Hg preinfusion vs 0.626 +/- 0.286 mm Hg after 8 hours of therapy, p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed that 12 patients had low pretreatment PbtO(2) (10.30 +/- 6.49 mm Hg), with higher CPP (p < 0.001) requiring, hyperoxia (p = 0.02). In this group, intravenous nicardipine resulted in air 83% improvement in 4- and 8-hour PbtO(2) levels (18.1 +/- 11.33 and respectively: p < 0.01) despite significant red 19.59 +/- 23.68 mm Hg, respectively; p < 0.01) despite significant reductions in both mean MABP (120.6 +/- 16.65 vs 95.8 +/- 8.3 mm Hg, p < 0.001) and CPP (105.00 +/- 20.7 vs 81.2 +/- 15.4 mm Hg, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions. Intravenous nicardipine is effective for the treatment of hypertensive neurological emergencies and has no adverse effect on PbtO(2). (DOI: 10.317.JNS.2008.109.12.1065)

TI Impact of body mass index on cerebellar tonsil position in healthy
   subjects and patients with Chiari malformation
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECT It is unclear if there is a relationship between Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) and body mass index (BMI). The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between BMI and cerebellar tonsil position in a random sample of people.
   METHODS Cerebellar tonsil position in 2400 subjects from a cohort of patients undergoing MRI was measured. Three hundred patients were randomly selected from each of 8 age groups (from 0 to 80 years). A subject was then excluded if he or she had a posterior fossa mass or previous posterior fossa decompression or if height and weight information within 1 year of MRI was not recorded in the electronic medical record.
   RESULTS There were 1310 subjects (54.6%) with BMI records from within 1 year of the measured scan. Of these subjects, 534 (40.8%) were male and 776 (59.2%) were female. The average BMI of the group was 26:4 kg/m(2), and the average tonsil position was 0.87 mm above the level of the forameh magnum. There were 46 subjects (3.5%) with a tonsil position >= 5 mm below the level of the foramen magnum. In the group as a whole, there was no correlation (R-2 = 0.004) between BMI and cerebellar tonsil position.
   CONCLUSIONS In this examination of 1310 subjects undergoing MRI for any reason, there was no relationship between BMI and the level of the cerebellar tonsils or the diagnosis of CM-I on imaging.

TI Complications after resection of parasagittal and superior sagittal
   sinus meningiomas
SO NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW
AB Parasagittal meningiomas (PSM) represent one of the most frequently encountered intracranial meningiomas and pose unique challenges given their intimate relationship with parasagittal bridging veins and superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Compromise of venous drainage during resection might be a source of significant postoperative complications including catastrophic intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Objective of this study was to identify postoperative complications and associated factors predisposing to their development. A retrospective review of histologically confirmed parasagittal meningiomas (Sindou grade 1-6) resected between 2011 and 2020 was performed. A total of 62 patients (35 females (56.45%); mean age 55.72) years were included. The mean follow-up was 40.84 months. Forty-two patients (67.74%) were treatment na & iuml;ve. Complete SSS occlusion was noted in 23 (37.1%). WHO grade 1 tumor was diagnosed in 32 (51.61%), WHO 2 in 23 (37.1%) and WHO 3 in 7 cases (11.29%). The SSS was resected in 24 (38.71%) patients. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (ICH) was noted after 8 (12.90%) surgeries. Prior surgery (p = 0.006, OR = 22.1; 95% CI = 2.48-196.5) and higher tumor grade (OR = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.45-14.79, p = 0.01) were independently associated with greater risk of ICH. Resection of the SSS was not associated with postoperative ICH (p = 0.1388). A procedure-related mortality was noted in 2 patients (3.2%). Long term postoperative headaches were reported in 14 (22.58%) patients, associated with the resection of the SSS (p = 0.0003). Four (6.56%) patients had a CSF diversion procedure noted at the last follow up, correlated with ICH (p = 0.0124). History of prior surgery and higher WHO grade seem to be correlated with a significantly elevated risk of hemorrhage. Increased intracranial pressure, requiring CSF diversion is relatively infrequent occurring only in 6% patients, however awareness is important as prevention of its sequela is straightforward, preventing debilitating morbidity.

TI Consistent head up cardiopulmonary resuscitation haemodynamics are
   observed across porcine and human cadaver translational models
SO RESUSCITATION
AB Aim: The objectives were: 1) replicate key elements of Head Up (HUP) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) physiology in a traditional swine model of ventricular fibrillation (VF), 2) compare HUP CPR physiology in pig cadavers (PC) to the VF model 3) develop a new human cadaver (HC) CPR model, and 4) assess HUP CPR in HC.
   Methods: Nine female pigs were intubated, and anesthetized. Venous, arterial, and intracranial access were obtained. After 6 min of VF, CPR was performed for 2 min epochs as follows: Standard (S)-CPR supine (SUP), Active compression decompression (ACD) CPR + impedance threshold device (ITD-16) CPR SUP, then ACD + ITD HUP CPR. The same sequence was performed in PC 3 h later. In 9 HC, similar vascular and intracranial access were obtained and CPR performed for 1 min epochs using the same sequence as above.
   Results: The mean cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP, mmHg) was 14.5 +/- 6 for ACD + ITD SUP and 28.7 +/- 10 for ACD + ITD HUP (p = .007) in VF, -3.6 +/- 5 for ACD + ITD SUP and 7.8 +/- 9 for ACD + ITD HUP (p = .007) in PC, and 1.3 +/- 4 for ACD + ITD SUP and 11.3 +/- 5 for ACD + ITD HUP (p = .007) in HC. Mean systolic and diastolic intracranial pressures (ICP) (mmHg) were significantly lower in the ACD + ITD HUP group versus the ACD + ITD SUP group in all three CPR models.
   Conclusion: HUP CPR decreased ICP while increasing CerPP in pigs in VF as well as in PC and HC CPR models. This first-time demonstration of HUP CPR physiology in humans provides important implications for future resuscitation research and treatment.

TI Predicting Fluid Responsiveness in Acute Liver Failure: A Prospective
   Study
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB BACKGROUND: The profound hemodynamic changes seen in acute liver failure (ALF) resemble the hyperdynamic state found in the later stages of septic shock. Vasopressor support frequently is required after initial Volume therapy. Markers of preload dependency have not been studied in this patient group. Dynamic maneuvers such as passive leg raising or end-expiratory hold, which have shown good predictive accuracy in a general intensive care unit population, cannot be considered safe in this cohort because of the concerns of intracranial hypertension.
   METHODS: Mechanically ventilated patients with ALF admitted to a tertiary specialist intensive care unit in shock and multiorgan failure were enrolled. Markers of fluid responsiveness derived from transpulmonary thermodilution, pulse contour analysis, and echocardiography were compared between responders (cardiac index >= 15%) and nonresponders to a colloid fluid challenge (5 mL/kg predicted body weight). The ability to predict fluid responsiveness of stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation (PPV), and respiratory change in peak (delta V peak) left ventricular outflow tract velocity for preload dependency were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (mean +/- SD age, 38 [14] years, 13 male, 22 female]) were assessed after a single fluid challenge. Ten patients (29%) were fluid responders. Changes in cardiac index and stroke volume index in the cohort of 35 patients were correlated (R = 0.726 [99% confidence interval, 0.401-0.910]; P < .001). PPV predicted fluid responsiveness (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.752 [95% confidence interval, 0.565-0.889]; P = .005; cutoff >9%). The AUROC for stroke volume variation was 0.678 ([95% confidence interval, 0.499-0.825]; P = .084; cutoff >11%). The AUROC for [delta] V peak before fluid bolus was 0.637 (95% confidence interval, 0.413-0.825; P = .322).
   CONCLUSIONS: PPV based on pulse contour analysis predicted fluid responsiveness in ALE

TI Cardiac Output and Cerebral Blood Flow: A Systematic Review of
   Cardio-Cerebral Coupling
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Control of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is crucial to the management of neurocritically ill patients. Small studies which have examined the role of cardiac output (CO) as a determinant of CBF have inconsistently demonstrated evidence of cardio-cerebral coupling. Putative physiological mechanisms underpinning such coupling include changes in arterial blood pressure pulsatility, which would produce vasodilation through increased oscillatory wall-shear-stress and baroreceptor mediated reflex sympatholysis, and changes in venous backpressure which may improve cerebral perfusion pressure. We sought to summarize and contextualize the literature on the relationship between CO and CBF and discuss the implications of cardio-cerebral coupling for neurocritical care. A systematic review of the literature yielded 41 studies; all were of low-quality and at high-risk of bias. Results were heterogenous, with evidence for both corroboration and confutation of a relationship between CO and CBF in both normal and abnormal cerebrovascular states. Common limitations of studies were lack of instantaneous CBF measures with reliance on transcranial Doppler-derived blood flow velocity as a surrogate, inability to control for fluctuations in established determinants of CBF (eg, PaCO2), and direct effects on CBF by the interventions used to alter CO. Currently, the literature is insufficiently robust to confirm an independent relationship between CO and CBF. Hypothetically, the presence of cardio-cerebral coupling would have important implications for clinical practice. Manipulation of CBF could occur without the risks associated with extremes of arterial pressure, potentially improving therapy for those with cerebral ischemia of various etiologies. However, current literature is insufficiently robust to confirm an independent relationship between CO and CBF, and further studies with improved methodology are required before therapeutic interventions can be based on cardio-cerebral coupling.

TI Endovascular catheter manometry reliability: a benchtop validation study
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE Catheter manometry is used frequently in neuroendovascular surgery for assessing cerebrovascular pathology. The accuracy of pressure data with different catheter setups requires further validation.
   METHODS In a silicone human vascular model with a pulsatile pump, pressure measurements were taken through multiple arrangements of 2 guide catheters and 6 microcatheters. The systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, mean pressure, pulse pressure, and area under the curve of the waveform were recorded through catheters with controls at arterial blood pressure ranges. Linear regression modeling was performed, correlating transduction area and relative pulse pressure. Thresholds for acceptable accuracy were >= 90%.
   RESULTS Mean pressure demonstrated < 4% variation between all 24 catheter setups and respective controls. A strong linear correlation (r(2) = 0.843, p < 0.0005) between microcatheter transduction area and relative pulse pressure with a threshold of 0.50 mm 2 was seen (i.e., 0.031-inch inner diameter ODD. For guide catheters with indwelling microcatheters, there was also a strong linear correlation (0 = 0.840, p < 0.0005) of transduction area to pulse pressure. The guide catheters with obstructing microcatheters required a transduction area over fourfold higher compared with unobstructed microcatheters (2.21 mm(2) vs 0.50 mm(2)).
   CONCLUSIONS Mean pressure measurements are accurate through microcatheters as small as 0.013-inch ID. Pulse pressure and waveform morphology may require a microcatheter >= 0.031-inch ID to achieve 90% accuracy, although the 0.027-inch ID microcatheter reached 85% accuracy. A 0.070-inch guide catheter with a microcatheter <= 0.042-inch outer diameter (e.g., Marksman 0.027-inch ID or smaller) allows accurate transduction of pulse pressure. Further validation of these benchtop findings is necessary before application in a clinical setting.

TI Head midline position for preventing the occurrence or extension of
   germinal matrix-intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB Background
   Head position during care may affect cerebral haemodynamics and contribute to the development of germinal matrix-intraventricular haemorrhage (GM-IVH) in very preterm infants. Turning the head toward one side may occlude jugular venous drainage while increasing intracranial pressure and cerebral blood volume. It is suggested that cerebral venous pressure is reduced and hydrostatic brain drainage improved if the infant is cared for in the supine 'head midline' position.
   Objectives
   To assess whether head midline position is more effective than other head positions for preventing (or preventing extension) of GM-IVH in very preterm infants (< 32 weeks' gestation at birth).
   Search methods
   We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 12 September 2019), Embase (1980 to 12 September 2019), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CI NAHL; 1982 to 12 September 2019). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing caring for very preterm infants in a supine head midline position versus a prone or lateral decubitus position, or undertaking a strategy of regular position change, or having no prespecified position. We included trials enrolling infants with existing GM-IVH and planned to assess extension of haemorrhage in a subgroup of infants. We planned to analyse horizontal (fiat) versus head elevated positions separately for all body positions. Data collection and analysis We used standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were GM-IVH, severe IVH, and neonatal death. We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed effect model with risk ratio (RR) for categorical data; and mean, standard deviation (SD), and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
   Main results
   Three RCTs, with a total of 290 infants (either < 30 weeks' gestational age or < 1000 g body weight), met the inclusion criteria. Two trials compared supine midline head position versus head rotated 90 with the cot flat. One trial compared supine midline head position versus head rotated 90 with the bed tilted at 30. We found no trials that compared supine versus prone midline head position. Meta -analysis of three trials (290 infants) did not show an effect on rates of GM-IVH (RR 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.56; 12 = 0%) and severe IVH (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.33;12 = 0%) Neonatal mortality (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.93; 12 = 0%; RD -0.09, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01) and mortality until hospital discharge (typical RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.90; 12 = 0%; RD -0.10, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02) were lower in the supine midline head position. The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes because of limitations in study design and imprecision of estimates. We identified one ongoing study.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found few trial data on the effects of head midline position on GM-IVH in very preterm infants. Although meta -analyses suggest that mortality might be reduced, the certainty of the evidence is very low and it is unclear whether any effect is due to cot tilting (a co intervention in one trial). Further high -quality RCTs would be needed to resolve this uncertainty.

TI Chiari Type 1 Malformation in an Infant With Type 2 Pfeiffer Syndrome:
   Further Evidence of Acquired Pathogenesis
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB There seems to be an association between type 1 Chiari malformation (CM) and some congenital craniosynostosis syndromes. Type 2 Pfeiffer syndrome is a condition associated with premature fusion of multiple cranial sutures, cloverleaf skull (kleeblatschadel deformity), prominent ptosis, thumb and first toe abnormalities, variable syndactyly, and mutated genes for type 1 or 2 fibroblast growth factor receptor. These children generally do poorly because of significant often severe neurologic and cognitive defects, and many die very young. Roughly half of all patients with Pfeiffer syndrome, and virtually all with type 2 disease, also have type 1 CM. Chiari malformation may not be congenital but acquired as a consequence of the skull deformities and other associated intracranial factors in patients with craniosynostosis. We report a term male infant with type 2 Pfeiffer syndrome, who was not noted to have any CM on initial brain imaging done at 2 months but in whom repeated imaging demonstrated clear evidence of CM by 4 months, despite reconstructive craniotomies and unilateral ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion. Posterior fossa decompression yielded a good result. This patient provides further evidence to support the concept of acquired tonsillar herniation in patients with craniosynostosis syndromes. The etiology seems multifactorial and related to (1) the disproportionately slow growth of the skull relative to the brain, particularly in the posterior fossa, secondary to early fusion of skull sutures, in turn secondary to congenital deficiencies in fibroblast growth factor receptors; (2) impaired venous sinus drainage; (3) hydrocephalus; and (4) resultant elevations in intracranial pressure.

TI Syndrome of Inappropriately Low-Pressure Acute Hydrocephalus (SILPAH)
SO HYDROCEPHALUS
SE Acta Neurochirurgica Supplementum
CT 5th International Hydrocephalus Workshop
CY MAY 20-23, 2010
CL Crete, GREECE
AB Introduction: Most patients with acute hydrocephalus have ventriculomegaly and high intracranial pressure (ICP). However, there is a subset of patients who are symptomatic with acute ventriculomegaly and inappropriately low ICP.
   Methods: Two patient groups were defined. Each patient presented with clinical deterioration that included a significant decrease in level of consciousness with new and significant ventriculomegaly. Patients in group l (n = 10) were managed without endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). Group 2 was a series of patients (n = 10) managed with ETV.
   Results: Treatment for both groups involved insertion of an external ventricular drain (EVD) with ICP <5 cmH(2)O. Further treatment consisted of either neck wrapping with a tensor bandage and/or lowering the EVD to negative levels to facilitate drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which resulted in clinical improvement and resolution of ventriculomegaly. All 20 patients had anatomical obstruction to CSF flow into the subarachnoid space (SAS) confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with cine MRI studies. Group I patients were treated until shunt revision/insertion was possible (n=7), ICP normalized, and the EVD could be removed (n=2), or death (n=1) occurred. Patients in group 2 all underwent ETV, and ICP patterns normalized in all. Group 2 patients were managed with an EVD until shunt revision/insertion was required (n=2), ICP normalized and the EVD could be removed (n=7), or death (n=1) occurred.
   Discussion/Conclusions: The syndrome of inappropriately low-pressure acute hydrocephalus (SILPAH) is an important entity in both children and adults. A possible hypothesis invokes loss of an effective SAS. ETV reestablishes communication between the SAS and ventricles, producing a rapid return of normal ICP dynamics and a significant decrease in the number of shunt-dependant patients.

TI Prevention of nosocomial infection in a pediatric intensive care unit
   (PICU) through the use of selective digestive decontamination
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Objective: To assess the effectiveness of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) on the control of nosocomial infection (NI) in critically ill pediatric patients. Design: A prospective, randomized, non-blinded and controlled clinical microbiology study. Setting: The pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary level pediatric university hospital. Criteria for inclusion: Patients 1 month to 14 years old, who underwent some kind of manipulation or instrumentation (mechanical ventilation, vascular cannulation, monitoring of intracranial pressure, thoracic or abdominal drainage, bladder catheterization, peritoneal dialysis, etc.) and/or presented a neurological coma requiring a stay in the PICU of 3 or more days. Patients: Over a period of 2 years, 244 patients met the inclusion criteria; 18 patients were withdrawn because of protocol violation. The treatment group comprised 116 patients and the control group, 110 patients. Intervention: The treatment group received a triple therapy of colimycin, tobramycin and nystatin administered orally or via nasogastric tube every 6 hours. All patients with mechanical ventilation or immune-depression received decontamination treatment of the oropharyngeal cavity with hexitidine (Oraldine(R) 0.5 mg/ml) every 6-8 hours in accordance with the PICU's conventional protocol. Method: Up to 10 types of nosocomial infection were diagnosed following criteria of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The severity and manipulation of the patients on admission was assessed using the therapeutic intervention scoring system (TISS) and multi-organ system failure scores (MOSF). Measurements and main results. Univariant analysis: SDD did not significantly reduce the incidence of NI, antibiotic use, the length of stay, or :mortality; although a small percentage of respiratory and urinary tract infections was detected, catheter-related bacteremia was the most common infection. Multivariant analysis: Controlling the risk factors for each child through log regression showed that SDD acted as a protective factor for more than 90% of the sample with respect to the appearance of respiratory and urinary tract infections, reducing the risk of such infections to 1/5 and 1/3, respectively. Conclusions: SDD was effective in controlling respiratory and urinary tract infections in children admitted to the PICU, but it did not reduce the incidence of other types of nosocomial infection.

TI Cerebral venous thrombosis in Behcet's disease: a systematic review
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB Beh double dagger et's disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disorder which can involve the central nervous system (CNS). Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is one of its major neurological manifestations. We aimed to review the epidemiologic and clinical features of CVT in patients with BD, as well as the available data on therapeutic interventions and prognosis. Systematic review of all observational studies of BD patients was done. Search strategy included electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966-August 2009). Occurrence of CVT in BD and Neuro-Beh double dagger et patients, occurrence of CVT as the inaugural manifestation of BD, clinical and neuro-imaging characteristics of CVT, prothrombotic evaluation, treatment options and prognosis were extracted. A meta-analysis of available results was performed when feasible. Twenty-three studies were included, with 290 cases of CVT in patients with BD. The incidence of CVT per 1,000 person-years was 3 (95% CI: 1-8), being higher in retrospective studies (3.2, 95% CI: 1-10) than in prospective studies (2.7, 95% CI: 1-13). Among patients with neurologic involvement, the incidence rate was 15.1/1,000 person-years. The onset was progressive in 77% of the patients. Intracranial hypertension syndrome was a frequent presentation of CVT in BD. The most frequent sites of occlusion were the superior sagittal and the transverse sinus. Most of the studies did not evaluate the prevalence of prothrombotic disorders. Treated CVT was associated with a good prognosis. CVT is a frequent neurological manifestation of BD. When treated, BD-associated CVT bears a good prognosis. There is insufficient information regarding the role of concomitant prothrombotic disorders and specific treatments.

TI Propofol versus midazolam: Safety and efficacy for sedating the severe
   trauma patient
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB Previous studies have compared sedation profiles with midazolam (Mz) and propofol (Pf), particularly in heterogeneous populations of patients. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported after the administration of propofol. These side effects are potentially deleterious in severe trauma patients, particularly in patients with head trauma. To assess the safety and efficacy of Mt and Pf, alone or in combination, in the prolonged sedation of severe trauma patients, we designed a prospective, controlled, randomized, study. One hundred consecutively admitted trauma patients requiring mechanical ventilation and sedation for more than 48 h were studied. Patients were sedated according to three different protocols based on the continuous ni administration of Mt alone, Pf alone, and Mt in combination with Pf. All patients received morphine chloride. Safety and efficacy were assessed during the sedation and wake-up periods according to clinical and laboratory variables. Cerebral hemodynamics were also studied in patients with head trauma. Patients were sedated for 6.3 +/- 4.0 days (mean +/- SD). All three sedation regimens were equally efficacious in achieving the desired sedation goal. The incidence of adverse events during the sedation period was also similar. In head trauma patients with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, we did not find differences in ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure, or jugular venous oxygen saturation among the three groups. The serum triglyceride concentration was significantly higher in the Pf group. Wake-up time was significantly shorter in the Pf group. We conclude that both Mt and Pf are safe and efficacious in the sedation of severe trauma patients. The use of Pf in these patients is associated with a high incidence of hypertriglyceridemia and a shorter wake-up time. Implications: In a prospective, controlled, randomized study, we confirmed the safety and efficacy of midazolam and propofol, alone or in combination, in the prolonged sedation of a homogeneous group of severe trauma patients, particularly in patients with head trauma. The propofol group had shorter wake-up times and higher triglyceride levels.

TI The Developmental Characteristics of Mastoid Pneumatisation in Cleft
   Palate Children: The Genetic Influence
SO COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM
AB Physiologic and developmental role of mastoid pneumatisation in children with otitis media with effusion (OME) is still controversial. For measuring mastoid pneumatisation and examine developmental characteristics, we used children with orofacial malformation of high risk for long term negative pressure in the middle ear and are expected to have lower rate of size and growth of pneumatisation. Mastoid were measured on Schuller's mastoid X-ray pictures planimetrically in study group of 146 children with bilateral (BCLP), unilateral (UCLP) and isolated (ICP) cleft palate, and control group of non-cleft 52 children, both groups with confirmed otitis media with effusion and no previous otological surgery. The lowest pneumatisation found in BCLP, BCLP and UCLP showed no growth of mastoid with age and lower mastoid size than OME controls. ICP is the only cleft type with growth of mastoid with aging. OME patients has the highest size of mastoid and growth rate with aging.

TI Traumatic arteriovenous fistula between the extracranial middle
   meningeal artery and the pterygoid plexus: A case report and literature
   review
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB The formation of a traumatic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) between the extracranial middle meningeal artery (MMA) and the pterygoid plexus (PP) is very rare, and understanding of this condition is limited. This paper reports the case of an 8-year-old who suffered minor injuries after a high fall four months prior to admission and showed good recovery after one month. However, the child gradually developed exophthalmos of the left eye and conjunctival redness one month prior to admission. Auscultation revealed an intracranial murmur near the left side of the face, in the temporal region. A digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed rupture of the left extracranial MMA and an AVF between the MMA and the PP. The blood drained toward the cavernous sinus, resulting in retrograde blood flow into the ophthalmic vein and the cortical vein. The diagnosis was an AVF between the MMA and the PP, and a combination of coils and Onyx liquid embolic agent was employed to perform AVF embolization. Follow-up six months later indicated no recurrence of the AVF, and the patient showed good recovery with a normal-appearing left eye. The AVF in this case drained toward the cavernous sinus, and symptoms of increased intracranial venous system pressure were apparent, similar to those produced by fistulas between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. This condition is very rare, and the use of coils in combination with Onyx for AVF embolization is novel, warranting the reporting of the current case.

TI Effect of antisiphon devices on ventriculoperitoneal shunt drainage
   dynamics in growing children
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB OBJECTIVE Infants and small children face changing boundary conditions when treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) for hydrocephalus. There are no systematic data describing shunt drainage behavior and changes over time in a growing child. Using a child-adapted patient simulator, the authors investigated the drainage behaviors of fixed differential pressure (DP) valves and adjustable valves with devices for preventing overdrainage in children of different ages. METHODS Three miniNAV DP valves with a 10-cm H2O medium-pressure setting (MN10) and three adjustable proGAV2.0 valves with a 25-cm H2O gravitational unit (GU) at low 5-cm H2O opening pressure (PG5) and medium 10-cm H2O opening pressure (PG10) settings were each investigated with a hardware-in-the-loop test bed. This test bed consisted of a posture motion mechanism and two pressure compartments that mimicked intracranial and abdominal pressures and was used to test the VPS under realistic in vitro conditions. Body orientation and length were physically set according to the child's age. The software simulated the physiological situations of children aged 1, 5, and 10 years. All valves were tested according to these specifications, with 5 runs for 1 hour each in the horizontal, vertical, and horizontal positions. Intracranial pressure (ICP) and VPS flow were measured, and the respective cerebrospinal fluid volume changes and ICP set value were computed. RESULTS The drainage parameters increased with age in all valves in the vertical position, with that of MN10 being pronounced in the 1-year-old simulation. The GU values in PG5 and PG10 substantially reduced drainage compared with MN10. PG10 prevented drainage in the 1-year-old and 5-year-old setups, but there was some drainage at physiological ICP in the 10-year-old setup. In contrast, MN10 produced the largest decreases in ICP across all ages and positions, and overdrainage resulted in insufficient ICP recovery in the subsequent horizontal position. ICP levels were mostly constant with PG10 at all ages. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that unprotected DP valves may lead to overdrainage in infants, whereas lowpressure GU valves can prevent overdrainage through 5 years and medium-pressure GU valves admit physiological ICP through at least 10 years. Therefore, devices for preventing overdrainage should be included in the first implanted shunt, and opening pressure should be adjusted as the child grows.

SO NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB OBJECTIVE Acute and chronic hydrocephalus are common pathologies after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Generally, the presence of acute hydrocephalus is associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) treated with a ventricular drain. Subsequently, however, pronounced hydrocephalus without elevated ICP may develop in some patients with SAH in the postacute phase. This is described as acute low-pressure hydrocephalus (aLPH), and there are very limited data in the literature of this pathology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of and factors associ-ated with aLPH and describe its clinical course. METHODS In this retrospective single-center cohort study, the frequency and clinical characteristics of SAH-associated aLPH were investigated. Acute LPH was defined as an increase in ventricular size as measured by the Evans index, ICP within the normal range (< 5 mm Hg) at the time of ventricular enlargement, and timely neurological improvement after indwelling ventricular CSF drainage with negative pressure up to 5 cm H2O below normal level. Demographic and SAH-specific factors in patients with SAH treated using an external ventricular drain were extracted from the electronic medi- cal chart and further analyzed.RESULTS From November 2010 to May 2020, 15 (3.7.%) of 406 patients with SAH fulfilled the criteria for aLPH. Acute LPH was diagnosed after an average of 13.1 +/- 7.7 days. The presence of IVH and its extension were associated with the occurrence of aLPH. After undergoing the transient phase of aLPH, these patients subsequently developed a chronic, typical malresorptive hydrocephalus requiring a ventriculoperitoneal shunt more often (66.7% vs 17.4%, p < 0.001) and stayed longer in the intensive care unit (27 vs 20.5 days, p = 0.043) and in the hospital (36.4 vs 26.3 days, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Acute LPH is a rare pathology in patients with SAH and negatively impacts the clinical course. It should be especially considered in patients with a lack of neurological improvement, an increase in ventricular width, and normal ICP values, so that forced CSF drainage is implemented.

TI THE CEREBRAL AND SYSTEMIC HEMODYNAMIC AND METABOLIC EFFECTS OF
   DESFLURANE-INDUCED HYPOTENSION IN DOGS
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB The cerebral and systemic hemodynamic and metabolic effects of hypotension induced with desflurane were examined in 11 dogs.  During a steady-state baseline period under 1 MAC desflurane (7.2%), the following were measured or derived:  arterial, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures; arterial, mixed venous, and sagittal sinus blood gases; cardiac index and cerebral blood flow (CBF); whole-body and cerebral O2 consumption; systemic and cerebral vascular resistance; intracranial pressure; and blood glucose and lactate concentrations.  After the baseline period, hypotension to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50 mmHg was produced by 15.5% (2.2 MAC), and hypotension to an MAP of 40 mmHg was produced by 17.1% (2.4 MAC) for 1 h.  During this hypotensive period all measurements were taken at 5- or 15-min intervals.  At the end of the hypotensive period, brain biopsy specimens were taken for measurement of cerebral concentrations of ATP, phosphocreatine, and lactate to determine whether there was any metabolic evidence of cerebral ischemia.  Desflurane-induced hypotension produced a significant, 40-50% decrease in cardiac index with a significant change in systemic vascular resistance at the lower blood pressure, but produced little change in heart rate.  Even though whole-body O2 consumption did not decrease, adequate peripheral perfusion was maintained with the lower cardiac output, as evidenced by lack of accumulation of blood lactate.  Induced hypotension caused a significant, 50 (at MAP = 50 mmHg) to 64% (at MAP = 40 mmHg) decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure, accompanied by a significant, 36 (at MAP = 50 mmHg) to 60% (at MAP = 40 mmHg) decrease in CBF.  The concentration of desflurane necessary to produce these levels of hypotension significantly decreased cerebral O2 consumption (CMR(O2)) 19-21%, to 2.7-2.5 ml.min-1.100 g-1.  The cerebral metabolite concentrations of high-energy phosphates taken at the end of the hypotensive period were within the range of normal canine values for our laboratory, although there was a moderate increase in lactate concentration.  This indicates that the CBF, though decreased, was able to provide adequate cerebral perfusion to meet the demands of CMR(O2) even during the period of profound hypotension.

TI Effects of body position on intracranial and cerebral perfusion
   pressures in isoflurane-anesthetized horses
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Inhalant anesthetics may interfere with normal cerebrovascular autoregulation. It was, therefore, hypothesized that intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in isoflurane-anesthetized horses would be especially sensitive to body and head position because of the potential for large hydrostatic gradients between the brain and heart in this species. Anesthesia was induced and maintained in six clinically healthy, unmedicated geldings with 1.57% isoflurane in O-2; mechanical ventilation was used to maintain normocapnia. ICP was measured by using a subarachnoid strain-gauge transducer. Blood gases and carotid arterial, right atrial, and airway pressures were also measured. Five body positions were studied in semi-randomized order: dorsal recumbency (DR) with head down (HD), DR with head level (HL), lateral recumbency (LR), sternal recumbency (SR) with HL, and SR with head up (HU). Data were analyzed by using paired t-tests. ICP and CPP values, respectively, are as follows (means +/- SD): 36 +/- 4 and 55 +/- 18 mmHg (DR-HD); 34 +/- 6 and 51 +/- 32 mmHg (DR-HL); 24 +/- 5 and 48 +/- 4 mmHg (LR); 19 +/- 11 and 87 +/- 12 mmHg (SR-HL); and -14 +/- 7 and 71 +/- 10 mmHg (SR-HU). Significant differences were found among all positions, except for SR-HL vs. LR. Significant increases in CPP were observed only in sternal positions. In conclusion, ICP in isoflurane-anesthetized horses changes inversely with the brain-to-heart hydrostatic gradient. DR may also cause increases in ICP, irrespective of head position.

TI Immunomodulation of intracranial melanoma in response to blood-tumor
   barrier opening with focused ultrasound
SO THERANOSTICS
AB Background: Focused ultrasound (FUS) activation of microbubbles (MBs) for blood-brain (BBB) and blood-tumor barrier (BTB) opening permits targeted therapeutic delivery. While the effects of FUS+MBs mediated BBB opening have been investigated for normal brain tissue, no such studies exist for intracranial tumors. As this technology advances into clinical immunotherapy trials, it will be crucial to understand how FUS+MBs modulates the tumor immune microenvironment.
   Methods and Results: Bulk RNA sequencing revealed that FUS+MBs BTB/BBB opening (1 MHz, 0.5 MPa peak-negative pressure) of intracranial B16F1cOVA tumors increases the expression of genes related to proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine signaling, pattern recognition receptor signaling, and antigen processing and presentation. Flow cytometry revealed increased maturation (i.e. CD86) of dendritic cells (DCs) in the meninges and altered antigen loading of DCs in both the tumor and meninges. For DCs in tumor draining lymph nodes, FUS+MBs had no effect on maturation and elicited only a trend towards increased presentation of tumor-derived peptide by MHC. Neither tumor endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression nor homing of activated T cells was affected by FUS+MBs.
   Conclusion: FUS+MBs-mediated BTB/BBB opening elicits signatures of inflammation; however, the response is mild, transient, and unlikely to elicit a systemic response independent of administration of immune adjuvants.

TI Head and thorax elevation during active compression decompression
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation with an impedance threshold device
   improves cerebral perfusion in a swine model of prolonged cardiac arrest
SO RESUSCITATION
AB Aim of the study: As most cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) efforts last longer than 15 min, the aim of this study was to compare brain blood flow between the Head Up (HUP) and supine (SUP) body positions during a prolonged CPR effort of 15 min, using active compression-decompression (ACD) CPR and impedance threshold device (ITD) in a swine model of cardiac arrest.
   Methods: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced in anesthetized pigs. After 8 min of untreated VF followed by 2 min of ACD-CPR + ITD in the SUP position, pigs were randomized to 18 min of continuous ACD-CPR + ITD in either a 30 degrees HUP or SUP position. Microspheres were injected before VF and then 5 and 15 min after start of CPR.
   Results: The mean blood flow (ml/min/g, mean +/- SD) to the brain after 15 min of CPR was 0.42 +/- 0.05 in the HUP group (n = 8) and 0.21 +/- 0.04 SUP (n = 10), respectively, (p < 0.01). The HUP group also had statistically significantly lower intracranial pressures and higher calculated cerebral perfusion pressures after 5, 15, 19 (before adrenaline) and 20 (after adrenaline) minutes of HUT versus SUP CPR.
   Conclusions: After prolonged ACD-CPR + ITD in the HUP position, brain blood flow was 2-fold higher versus the SUP position. These positive findings provide strong pre-clinical support to proceed with a clinical evaluation of elevation of the head and thorax during ACD-CPR + ITD in humans in cardiac arrest.

TI SYSTEMIC AND CEREBRAL EFFECTS OF ISOFLURANE-INDUCED HYPOTENSION IN DOGS
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB The systemic and cerebral effects of hypotension induced with isoflurane were examined in 12 dogs. Hypotension to a mean arterial pressure of either 50 mmHg or 40 mmHg for 1 h was produced by 2.5 .+-. 0.1-2.9 .+-. 0.3% end-expired isoflurane anesthesia. Before and during the period of hypotension the following were measured or derived: arterial and pulmonary artery pressures; arterial, mixed venous and sagittal sinus blood gases; cardiac output and cerebral blood flow; whole body and cerebral O2  consumption; systemic and cerebral vascular resistance; intracranial pressure, serum lactate and pyruvate concentrations; and blood glucose. At the end of the period of hypotension, brain biopsy specimens were taken for the determination of ATP, ADP, AMP, phosphocreatine, lactate and pyruvate concentrations. Isoflurane-induced hypotension produced a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance (27-43%) associated with a significant decrease in cardiac output (39-42%) and a smaller  decrease in whole-body O2 consumption (14-21%). Isoflurane also produced a significant decrease in cerebral O2 consumption (40-44%) accompanied by a decrease in cerebral blood flow (60-62%). Following both the 40 and 50 mm Hg periods of hypotension, the cerebral energy state was normal, indicating the preservation of normal aerobic metabolism. This differs from previous results obtained using a similar protocol, wherein trimethaphan-induced hypotension to 50 mm Hg and trimethaphan, halothane and nitroprusside-induced hypotension to 40 mm Hg were associated with gross alterations in the cerebral energy state. The failure to observe any detrimental effects of isoflurane-induced hypotension indicates that isoflurane may offer some advantage over other hypotensive techniques and is consistent with the concept that isoflurane offers a potential for cerebral protection.

TI Metastable State of Water and Performance of Osmotically Driven Membrane
   Processes
SO MEMBRANES
AB Semipermeable membranes play critical roles in many natural and engineering systems. The osmotic pressure is found experimentally much less effective than the hydraulic pressure to drive water through the membrane, which is commonly attributed to the internal concentration polarization (ICP) in the porous layer of the membrane. In this study, it has been shown that a necessary condition for the osmotic pressure to be effective is water continuity across the entire membrane thickness under negative pressure, i.e., the water inside the membrane remains in a metastable state. However, the metastable state of water cannot be maintained indefinitely, and cavitation will undoubtedly occur in the osmotically driven processes. Collapse of the water metastable state was suggested for the first time to be a more important and fundamental reason for the low water fluxes in the osmotically driven membrane processes.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF INTRAVASCULAR VOLUME EXPANSION ON CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW
   AND BLOOD-VOLUME IN NORMAL RATS
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Background. Intravascular volume expansion can increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with cerebral ischemia. However, the changes in CBF produced by volume expansion in the normal brain remain the subject of debate, and the changes on cerebral blood volume (CBV; one determinant of intracranial pressure) have not been described. The effects of acute nondilutional volume expansion on cardiac output (CO), CBF, and CBV in normal rats were examined.
   Methods: Normocarbic, normothermic halothane/N2O-anesthetized rats were given 0, 6, 12, 24, or 36 ml of a blood-hetastarch mixture (n = 6 for each group). When volume loading was completed, H-3-nicotine was used to measure CBF, while Tc-99m-labeled red cells and C-14-dextran were used to measure cerebral red cell and plasma volumes. Animals were killed by microwave irradiation (8KW X 770 msec). In different animals, cardiac output (CO) was measured by thermodilution during the infusion of 36 ml of blood-hetastarch.
   Results. Central venous pressure (CVP) increased from 3.9 +/- 0.7 mmHg (mean +/- SD) in control animals to 13.0 +/- 2.0 mmHg in rats given 36 ml of blood. Cardiac output increased to 138 +/- 11% of control. There were no changes in arterial Hct or mean arterial pressure. There were no significant changes in CBF (which varied from 127 +/- 22 ml . 100 g-1 . min-1 in controls to 102 +/- 14 after the infusion of 36 ml). However, CBV increased in a linear fashion with increasing CVP, from 2.96 +/- 0.57 ml/100 g in control conditions to 4.47 +/- 0.83 ml/100 g after the infusion of 36 ml of blood/hetastarch.
   Conclusions. In normal brain, CBF does not change during volume expansion, in spite of an increase in CO. This contradicts earlier studies, the results of which indicate an independent role for cardiac output in CBF control. Cerebral blood volume increased in proportion to CVP, suggesting simple passive venous distention. Whether this could increase ICP and compromise cerebral perfusion remains unclear.

TI Association of increased body mass index with Chiari malformation Type I
   and syrinx formation in adults
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Object. In this paper the authors describe an association between increased body mass index (BMI) and Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) in adults, as well as its relationship to the development of syringomyelia.
   Methods. In the period between January 2004 and December 2011, the senior author reviewed the data for all CM-I patients with or without syringomyelia and neurological deficit. Analyzed factors included clinical status (headaches and neurological signs), radiological characteristics of syringomyelia (diameter and vertical extent of syrinx), BMI, and relationship of age to BMI, syrinx diameter, and vertical extent of syrinx.
   Results. Sixty consecutive adults had CM-I, 26 of whom also had syringomyelia. The mean BMI among all patients was 30.35 +/- 7.65, which is Class I obesity (WHO), and was similar among patients with or without syringomyelia. Extension of the vertical syrinx was greater in overweight patients (p = 0.027) than in those with a normal body weight. Evidence of de novo syrinx formation was found in 2 patients who gained an average BMI of 10.8 points. After repeated decompression and no change in holocord syrinx width or vertical extent, a reduction in the syrinx was seen after BMI decreased 11.7 points in one individual. No correlation was found between patient age and BMI, age and vertical extension of the syrinx, and age and diameter of the syrinx.
   Conclusions. An association between increased BMI and CM-I in adults was recognized. Gaining weight may influence the de novo creation of a syrinx in adults who previously had minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic CM-I, and reducing weight can improve a syrinx after unsuccessful surgical decompression. Therefore, a reduction in body weight should be recommended for all overweight and obese patients with CM-I.

TI Deterioration of cerebral autoregulation during orthostatic stress:
   insights from the frequency domain
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB To determine whether dynamic cerebral autoregulation is impaired during orthostatic stress, cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler) and mean arterial pressure (MAP; Finapres) were measured continuously in 12 healthy subjects during ramped maximal lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to presyncope. Velocity and pressure were averaged over B-min periods of stable data at rest and during LBNP to examine steady-state cerebral hemodynamics. Beat-to-beat variability of velocity and pressure were quantified by a "variation index" (oscillatory amplitude/steady-state mean value) and by power spectral analysis. The dynamic relationship between changes in pressure and velocity was evaluated by the estimates of transfer and coherence function. The results of the study were as follows. Steady-state MAP remained relatively constant during LBNP, whereas CBF velocity decreased progressively by 6, 15, and 21% at -30, -40, and -50 mmHg LBNP, respectively (P < 0.05 compared with baseline). At the maximal level of LBNP (30 s before presyncope) MAP decreased by 9.4% in association with a prominent reduction in velocity by 24% (P < 0.05 compared with baseline). The variation index of pressure increased significantly from 3.8 +/- 0.3% at baseline to 4.5 +/- 0.6% at -50 mmHg LBNP in association with an increase in the variation index of velocity from 6.0 +/- 0.6 to 8.4 +/- 0.7% (P < 0.05). Consistently, the low- (0.07-0.20 Hz) and high-frequency (0.20-0.30 Hz) power of variations in pressure and velocity increased significantly at high levels of LBNP (P < 0.05) in association with an increase in transfer function gain (24% at -50 mmHg, P < 0.05). We conclude that the damping effects of autoregulation on variations in CBF velocity are diminished during orthostatic stress in association with substantial falls in steady-state CBF velocity. We suggest that these changes may contribute in part to the development of presyncope.

TI Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate for improved outcome after hypothermic
   circulatory arrest in pigs
SO JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB Objective: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is a high-energy intermediate in the anaerobic metabolism. It enhances glycolysis, preserves cellular adenosine triphosphate, and prevents the increase of intracellular calcium during ischemia. The potential neuroprotective effect of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate during hypothermic circulatory arrest was evaluated in a surviving porcine model.
   Methods: Twenty-four pigs were randomly assigned to receive two intravenous infusions of either fructose- 1,6-bisphosphate (500 mg/kg) or saline solution. The first infusion was given immediately before a 75-minute period of hypothermic circulatory arrest and the second was given immediately after hypothermic circulatory arrest.
   Results: The 7-day survivals were 83.3% in the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate group and 41.7% in the control group (P = .09). The treated animals had significantly better postoperative behavioral scores. The administration of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate was associated with higher venous phosphate and sodium levels, lower venous ionized calcium levels, higher blood osmolarity, and a better fluid balance. Intracranial pressure and venous creatine kinase isoenzyme MB were significantly lower in the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate group during rewarming (P = .01 and P = .001, respectively). Among the treated animals, brain glucose, pyruvate and lactate levels tended to be higher, brain glycerol levels tended to be lower, and the histopathologic score of the brain was significantly lower (P = .04).
   Conclusions: Intravenous administration of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate at 500 mg/kg before and after hypothermic circulatory arrest in a surviving porcine model was associated with better survival, behavioral outcome, and histopathologic score. The observed lower blood creatine kinase isoenzyme MB and brain glycerol levels and the higher brain glucose, pyruvate, and lactate levels in the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate group suggest that this drug has supportive effects on myocardial and brain metabolisms.

AB Objective: The cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST), severe neurological emergencies is an important pathology of the venous brain system. This paper is an on-going study about CVST, the first report was done in 2008. Material and methods: We received 32 patients hospitalized on emergency between February 2006 - February 2013 (only self-casuistry). Demographic (sex, age), clinical, imagistic (cerebral MRI venous angiography, cerebral CT), paraclinic (CSF, factor V Leiden mutation) data, as well as risk factors, treatment, evolution and neurologic recovery were all considered. Results: We studied 20 females and 12 males (62% versus 38%). Etiology: oral contraceptives (8 cases), otomastoiditis (7cases), dental abscess of the upper jaw (3 cases), maxilar sinusitis (2 cases), penetrating skull trauma (3 cases), ethmoidal puncture for frontal sinusitis (1 case), provoked abortion (2cases), pregnancy (1 case), puerperium (1 case), hereditary thrombophilia-factor V Leiden mutation (heterozigot fenotype - 3 cases), encephalitis with HSV (1case). The symptomatology varied according to the disease etiology and the location of CVST. Initial clinical symptoms include: coma (3 cases), headache (26 cases), seizures (20 cases), motor and mental disturbances (18 cases), cranial nerves palsy (18 cases), intracranial hypertension (8 cases), papilledema (4 cases), nausea and vomiting (20 cases). Cerebral MRI-venous angiography is the optimum diagnosis method we applied to all patients. Conclusions: CVST even with a reduced occurrence, represents a severe neurovascular emergency. CVST is more common in women, frequently associated with oral contraceptives, abortion, pregnancy or puerperium (37 %). Young patients with CVST should be screened for thrombophilia. If diagnosed at an early stage, especially by cerebral MRI-venous angiography and correctly treated, the patients have a favorable evolution, the lethal cases decreasing until 3 %. Patients with septic CVST and coma from the beginning have bad prognosis. The efficacy of heparin with APTT controlled has been shown. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Efficacy of hypertonic saline and mannitol in patients with traumatic
   brain injury and cerebral edema: a systematic review and meta-analysis
SO EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB BackgroundTraumatic brain injury has a crippling impact on sufferers' quality of life, and numerous therapy techniques are being researched to address this problem. In this study, we compared the superiority of HS against mannitol as one such element of treating TBI patients.ObjectiveTo compare the efficacy of hypertonic saline and mannitol and demonstrate superiority of one group over the other.MethodOur meta-analysis included only randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of mannitol and hypertonic saline in the treatment of traumatic brain injury. The literature search was done using a variety of databases, like Google Scholar, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. From each of the included RCTs, accurate data extraction, bias risk assessment, and statistical analysis were carried out.ResultThere are 748 patients among the 15 RCTs. Our primary outcomes are mortality and functional outcomes, and our secondary outcomes include treatment failure, osmolality, intracerebral pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), serum sodium (Na), partial pressure of oxygen in brain tissue (PBTO2), duration of elevated ICP, mean arterial pressure, hematocrit level, and central venous pressure. The comparison showed non-significant results for mortality (RR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.49-1.08; p = 0.12) and functional outcome (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.74-1.80; p = 0.53). HS is linked to higher Na levels (RR = 4.55, 95% CI 1.34-7.76, P = 0.005, I2 = 96%). Despite performing a sensitivity analysis due to the heterogeneities in our various outcomes, the findings were still unreliable.ConclusionOur study revealed inconsequential trends for HS and mannitol, and no conclusion was made. We believe the two medications to be equally effective, but there is still opportunity for improvement as more studies are carried out. Eventually, a conclusive decision can be reached in the future.

TI Hypoplasia of the ipsilateral internal jugular vein is associated with
   worse outcome in acute anterior circulataion stroke
SO VOJNOSANITETSKI PREGLED
AB Background/Aim. Disruption of cerebral venous blood drainage leads to cerebral venous congestion, an increase in intracranial pressure and decrease of the cerebral perfusion pressure. The exact role of the cerebral venous circulation in acute stroke is not yet known. The main blood drainage from the brain and the superficial parts of the face and neck is drained by a paired internal jugular vein (IJV). Congenital anomalies of IJV may disrupt the blood collection from the brain, which leads to congestion of the cerebral venous circulation. The aim of our study was to determine the association between the hypoplastic ipsilateral IJV and clinical outcome of patients with acute ischemic anterior circulation stroke. Methods. This prospective case series study involved the patients with the anterior circulation stroke and ultrasonographic criteria for unilateral hypoplasia of the ipsilateral IJV. Data from the 74 consecutive patients with acute anterior circulation stroke admitted to the Special Hospital for Cerebrovascular Diseases "Sveti Sava", Belgrade, from September 2015 to January 2016 were included. Ultrasonography of IJV diameter and the collection of the hemodynamic data were performed in all patients. Neurological deficits on admission were evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. The clinical outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (from 0 to 6) at 30 days or at discharge, whichever occurred sooner. Good and poor outcomes were defined as an mRS score of 0-2 and 3-6, respectively. Results. Ipsilateral hypoplastic IJV was diagnosed in 13 (17.6%) patients with anterior circulation stroke. In this group, 9 stroke patients (69.2%) had mRS >= 3. Of the remaining 4 patients with mRS <= 2, three had bilateral hypoplasia of IJV and one patient had smaller diameter of the IJV, but did not fulfill the ultrasonographic criteria for hypoplastic venous anomaly. Conclusions. In our case, a series of the patients with anterior circulation stroke with ultrasonographic criteria for unilateral hypoplasia of the ipsilateral IJV (on stroke side) have worse clinical outcome compared with the patients with bilateral hypoplasia.

TI Transcranial Doppler ultrasound goal-directed therapy for the early
   management of severe traumatic brain injury
SO INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of early transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) goal-directed therapy after severe traumatic brain injury initiated before invasive cerebral monitoring is available. Design: Prospective, observational clinical study. Setting: Surgical intensive care unit, university hospital. Patients and participants: Twenty-four severely brain-injured patients. Interventions: All patients had TCD measurements immediately on admission (T0) and when invasive cerebral monitoring was available (T1). TCD was considered abnormal when two out of three measured values were outside the following limits: Vm < 30 cm/s, Vd < 20 cm/s, PI > 1.4. When admission TCD was abnormal, attending physicians modified treatment to increase cerebral perfusion pressure. Measurements and results: Admission TCD was performed 18 +/- 11 min (T0) after admission, whereas cerebral inasive monitoring was available 242 +/- 116 min (T1) after admission. At T0, 11 (46%) patients had abnormal TCD values (group 1) and 13 had normal TCD values (group 2); mean arterial pressure was comparable between groups. All group 1 patients received mannitol and/or norepinephrine. At T1, mean arterial pressure was increased compared to admission in group 1 (105 +/- 17 mmHg vs. 89 +/- 15 mmHg, p < 0.05) and only two patients had still an abnormal TCD. Although group 1 patients had higher intracranial pressure than those of group 2 (32 +/- 13 mmHg vs. 22 +/- 10 mmHg, p < 0.01), both cerebral perfusion pressure and jugular venous oxygen saturation were comparable between the groups. Conclusions: The use of TCD at hospital admission allows identification of severely brain-injured patients with brain hypoperfusion. In such high-risk patients, early TCD goal-directed therapy can restore normal cerebral perfusion and might then potentially help in reducing the extent of secondary brain injury.

TI Malignant Cerebral Venous Infarction: Decompressive Craniectomy versus
   Medical Treatment
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a common type of stroke in young adults and associated with 8% mortality. High intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain herniation are the most common causes of death in these patients. In contrast with malignant arterial middle cerebral infarction, there are few studies reporting the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy (DC) for treatment of high ICP in patients with CVT. In this study, we assess the clinical outcome of patients with CVT with impending brain herniation treated with DC versus medical management.
   METHODS: In this retrospective study, medical records of all patients with CVT admitted to our hospital were reviewed. Patients with the following inclusion criteria were entered into the study: 1) CVT proven by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venogram and/or computed tomography venogram, 2) malignant CVT (impending brain herniation according to imaging and clinical finding), and 3) age between 16 and 80 years. Patients with deep venous system thrombosis, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, and bilateral nonreactive midposition pupils or mydriasis on admission were excluded. Patients were classified into 2 groups: surgical group (DC group) including patients who received medical treatment and DC and medical group (MG) including patients who received only medical treatment. Outcomes and complications were assessed and compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Of 357 patients with CVT hospitalized in our center, 48 patients entered into the study. Twenty-three patients were managed medically, and 25 patients were managed surgically. There was no significant difference between the groups concerning age, sex, presenting symptoms, transient and permanent risk factors of CVT, GCS score on admission, and pupils' reactivity on admission. All patients in the MG died during hospitalization in comparison with 8 patients in the DC group (100% vs. 32%, P < 0.001). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score 0-2) was achieved in 52% of the DC group and 0% of the MG group (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study confirmed that in contrast with DC, medical treatment could not prevent transtentorial herniation. DC is not only lifesaving for patients with CVT with impending brain herniation but also results in favorable outcome in most patients.

TI CEREBRAL EFFECTS OF HIGH-DOSE MIDAZOLAM AND SUBSEQUENT REVERSAL WITH RO
   15-1788 IN DOGS
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB The effects of a continuous high-dose infusion of midazolam on cerebral function, metabolism, and hemodynamics were studied in nine dogs receiving a spinal anesthetic and breathing 65% nitrogen/35% oxygen. In five dogs, the effects of 65% nitrous oxide (N2O) inspired and the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 were also examined. Midazolam was infused at a rate of 0.66 mg .cntdot. kg-1 min-1 for 60 min for a total dose of 40 mg .cntdot. kg-1. Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) (measured by venous outflow technique) both decreased until a plateau level was reached at approximately 75% of control values (4.0 .+-. 0.2 ml .cntdot. min-1 .cntdot. 100 g-1 and 49 .+-. 3 ml .cntdot. min-1 .cntdot. 100 g-1, respectively, mean .+-. SEM). This occurred after 6-10 mg .cntdot. kg-1 of midazolam, corresponding to serum midazolam levels between 18.4 .+-. 3.8 and 31.2 .+-. 3.3 .mu.g .cntdot. ml-1. Serum midazolam levels increased throughout the midazolam infusion, reaching a mean value of 53 .+-. 5.5 .mu.g .cntdot. ml-1 by the end of the midazolam infusion. A similar plateau was seen for changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG), which never developed burst suppression. Five dogs inspired 65% nitrous oxide/35% oxygen during minutes 30-45 of the midazolam infusion, rather than 65% nitrogen 35% oxygen. Nitrous oxide had no effect upon CMRO2, but significantly increased CBF when compared to dogs receiving nitrogen. Ro 15-1788, 1.0 mg .cntdot. kg-1 caused a return of CMRO2 and EEG activity to control levels. CBF and intracranial pressure (CP) increased markedly, to greater than control levels immediately following Ro 15-1788. After 15 min, both CBF and ICP had decreased to near levels seen immediately prior to Ro 15-1788 administration. Ro 15-1788 administration was associated with a decrease in MAP requiring treatment with intravenous fluids and a low-dose phenylephrine infusion to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg samples for cerebral metabolite determination taken either at the end of the midazolam infusion, or following Ro 15-1788, were essentially normal. The authors conclude that midazolam produces a limited dose-related decrease in CMRO2 which correlates with decreases in neuronal function. There were no apparent toxic effects of midazolam 40 mg .cntdot. kg-1. The combination of midazolam and Ro 15-1788 was effective in reversing the cerebral effects of high-dose midazolam, without untoward effects upon cerebral metabolite concentrations. However, Ro 15-1788 administration was associated with a significant increase in CBF and ICP, and a decrease in MAP.

TI Volume expansion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation reduces cerebral
   no-reflow
SO RESUSCITATION
AB Resuscitation of the brain after cardiac arrest requires homogeneous blood recirculation which, however, may be impaired by low reperfusion pressure, intravascular coagulation, increased blood viscosity and endothelial cell swelling. Intravascular volume expansion induced by intravenous infusion of a small volume of hypertonic solution has previously been shown to improve nutritional flow to the brain after severe hemorrhage shock. We therefore investigated whether this therapy also improves cerebral reperfusion after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Fourteen adult normothermic cats were resuscitated after 15 min of ventricular fibrillation by closed-chest cardiac massage in combination with epinephrine, bicarbonate and DC-defibrillations. Eight animals were submitted to the standard resuscitation protocol. Six cats received additionally 2 ml/kg/10 min 7.5% NaCl/6% hydroxyethyl starch solution for post-ischemic volume expansion. EEG, EGG, CBF, and the aortic, left ventricular, central venous and intracranial pressures were monitored. Reperfusion of the brain was visualized 30 min after cardiac resuscitation by labelling the circulating blood with fluorescein isothiocyanate albumin. Areas of impaired brain reperfusion (no-reflow) - defined by the absence of microvascular filling - were identified by fluorescence microscopy at eight standard coronal levels of the forebrain, and expressed as percent of total sectional area. All animals were successfully resuscitated although volume expansion decreased myocardial and cerebral reperfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Treatment with hypertonic solution increased serum osmolality transiently and prevented hemoconcentration throughout the experiment. Cerebral no-reflow was significantly reduced from 28 +/- 13% to 15 +/- 6% of total forebrain sectional area. Volume expansion by small volume hypertonic solutions may, therefore, improve recovery of brain function following cardiac arrest.

TI Progressive Cerebral Venous Thrombosis with Cranial Nerve Palsies in an
   Adolescent African Girl & Associated Diagnostic Pitfalls: A Rare Case
   Report
SO INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CASE REPORTS JOURNAL
AB Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a cerebrovascular disorder caused by complete or partial occlusion of the cerebral venous and sinus system. The etiology has been attributed to hypercoagulability and pro-thrombotic states, leading to raised intracranial pressures that often manifest as headaches and focal neurological deficits. However, the multifactorial nature of CVT can create a diagnostic conundrum for clinicians. We describe a unique case of a 16-year-old female who presented with convulsions, postictal confusion, and drowsiness followed by residual weakness of her extremities. She initially presented to the primary care center with headache, high-grade fever, and altered mental status and was empirically treated for pyogenic meningitis. The patient failed to improve with a week of antibiotics and was referred to the tertiary care center for urgent attention. On presentation, the patient developed VI and VII cranial nerve palsy. Subsequently, MRI images showed filling defects in the superior sagittal, right transverse, and sigmoid sinuses with right parietal gyral T1 hyperintensity and T2 hypo-intensity. She was diagnosed with septic CVT based on sinus venous thrombosis and venous infarction, probably secondary to meningococcal pneumonia. It can be challenging to distinguish between both conditions as their presentations overlap. Moreover, cranial nerve palsy is an infrequent manifestation of CVT, with unclear pathogenesis. We highlight the role of neuro-imaging in the early detection of CVT and bring to light the unfamiliar symptoms and a more varied clinical spectrum that may hinder the diagnosis in a limited-resource setting. Future research should be explicitly modeled to improve the diagnostic efficiency of CVT and improve outcomes in younger patient populations.

AB Right ventricular (RV) failure, which is a leading cause of early morbidity and mortality following cardiac transplantation, is attributed to the inability of the donor RV to acutely compensate for the recipient's elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Furthermore, the effect of donor brain death (BD) on RV function is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of donor BD on RV function in the setting of elevated PVR. The interactions of the RV and its afterload, the pulmonary vasculature, and left atrial pressure were assessed. by measurements of pulmonary vascular energetics and their oscillatory nature using proximal ultrasonic pulmonary artery (PA) flow probe and micromanometers in the proximal and distal PA in 20 mongrel dogs (25.8 +/- 0.4 kg, five control animals). A band was placed around the distal PA (PA-systolic gradient >15 mm Hg). BD was induced by rising intracranial pressure and was validated neuropathologically. Data were collected at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after BD in both banded and control animals. Fourier analysis was used to calculate RV oscillatory power, mean power, and total power (TP). Comparison of changes due to handing were made to baseline measurements using multivariate analysis and paired Student's t test (p < 0.05). A significant twofold to fourfold increase in pulmonary impedance and PVR occurred with an acute rise in PA gradient. Control animals tolerated acute increases in PVR without significant changes in TP. There was a significant increase of RV TP from 73 (+/- 11) to 98 (+/- 10) mW at baseline after the acute rise in PVR and impedance. After BD, the response to increased PVR and impedance was abolished significantly compared with baseline and control animals, suggesting a significant loss of compensatory TP to sustain pulmonary vascular blood flow. The data indicate that BD is detrimental to RV mechanical function.

TI The importance of the cortical subarachnoid space in understanding
   hydrocephalus
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB Object. In this paper the authors define the role of the cortical subarachnoid space (CSAS) in poorly understood forms of hydrocephalus to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics to improve understanding of the importance of the CSAS and its role in selecting patients for endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). The secondary purpose of this work was to define testable hypotheses to explain enigmatic disorders of CSF dynamics and to suggest how these concepts could be tested.
   Methods. The magnitude of the contribution of the CSAS is explored using the solid geometry of concentric spheres. With this starting point clinical conditions in which CSF dynamics are not easily understood are explored regarding the potential role of the CSAS. Overall, problems of CSF dynamics are easily understood. Insights may be gained when the results of a pathological process or its treatment vary from what has been expected.
   Results. Acute changes in ventricular volume at the time that hydrocephalus develops, the failure of shunts, and the changes in ventricular volume with shunt repair may occur very rapidly. Changes in the volume of water in the brain, especially in the brain substance itself, are unlikely to occur at this rapid rate and may be interpreted as a simple redistribution of the CSF between the ventricle and CSAS with no initial change in the actual volume of brain parenchyma. Problems such as pseudotumor cerebri, shunt failure with nonresponsive ventricles, and negative-pressure hydrocephalus can be explained by assessing the ability of ventricular CSF to flow to the CSAS and the ability of this fluid to exit this compartment. Ventricular enlargement at the time of shunt failure implies a failure of flow between the ventricles and CSAS, implying that all patients who show this phenomenon are potential candidates for ETV.
   Conclusions. The important role of the CSAS in the pathophysiology of various forms of hydrocephalus has been largely ignored. Attention to the dynamics of the CSF in this compartment will improve understanding of enigmatic conditions of hydrocephalus and improve selection criteria for treatment paradigms such as ETV. These concepts lead to clearly defined problems that may be solved by the creation of a central database to address these issues.

TI Case Report: Cerebral Revascularization in a Child With
   Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I
SO FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type I is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) resulting in multisystem disease. Neurological morbidity includes hydrocephalus, spinal cord compression, and cognitive decline. While many neurological symptoms have been described, stroke is not a widely-recognized manifestation of MPS I. Accordingly, patients with MPS I are not routinely evaluated for stroke, and there are no guidelines for managing stroke in patients with this disease. We report the case of a child diagnosed with MPS I who presented with overt stroke and repeated neurological symptoms with imaging findings for severe ventriculomegaly, infarction, and bilateral terminal carotid artery stenosis. Direct intracranial pressure evaluation proved negative for hydrocephalus. The patient was subsequently treated with cerebral revascularization and at a 3-year follow-up, the patient reported no further neurological events or new ischemia on cerebral imaging. Cerebral arteriopathy in patients with MPS I may be associated with GAG accumulation within the cerebrovascular system and may predispose patients to recurrent strokes. However, further studies are required to elucidate the etiology of cerebrovascular arteriopathy in the setting of MPS I. Although the natural history of steno-occlusive arteriopathy in patients with MPS I remains unclear, our findings suggest that cerebral revascularization is a safe treatment option that may mitigate the risk of future strokes and should be strongly considered within the overall management guidelines for patients with MPS I.

TI A Prospective Observational Feasibility Study of Jugular Bulb
   Microdialysis in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
SO NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB Background Cerebral metabolic perturbations are common in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Monitoring cerebral metabolism with intracerebral microdialysis (CMD) allows early detection of secondary injury and may guide decisions on neurocritical care interventions, affecting outcome. However, CMD is a regional measuring technique that is influenced by proximity to focal lesions. Continuous microdialysis of the cerebral venous drainage may provide information on global cerebral metabolism relevant for the care of aSAH patients. This observational study aimed to explore the feasibility of jugular bulb microdialysis (JBMD) in aSAH and describe the output characteristics in relation to conventional multimodal monitoring. Methods Patients with severe aSAH were included at admission or after in-house deterioration when local clinical guidelines prompted extended multimodal monitoring. Non-dominant frontal CMD, intracranial pressure (ICP), partial brain tissue oxygenation pressure (PbtO(2)), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were recorded every hour. The dominant jugular vein was accessed by retrograde insertion of a microdialysis catheter with the tip placed in the jugular bulb under ultrasound guidance. Glucose, lactate, pyruvate, lactate/pyruvate ratio, glycerol, and glutamate were studied for correlation to intracranial measurements. Modified Rankin scale was assessed at 6 months. Results Twelve adult aSAH patients were monitored during a mean 4.2 +/- 2.6 days yielding 22,041 data points for analysis. No complications related to JBMD were observed. Moderate or strong significant monotonic CMD-to-JBMD correlations were observed most often for glucose (7 patients), followed by lactate (5 patients), and pyruvate, glycerol, and glutamate (3 patients). Moderate correlation for lactate/pyruvate ratio was only seen in one patient. Analysis of critical periods defined by ICP > 20, CPP < 65, or PbtO(2) < 15 revealed a tendency toward stronger CMD-to-JBMD associations in patients with many or long critical periods. Possible time lags between CMD and JBMD measurements were only identified in 6 out of 60 patient variables. With the exception of pyruvate, a dichotomized outcome was associated with similar metabolite patterns in JBMD and CMD. A nonsignificant tendency toward greater differences between outcome groups was seen in JBMD. Conclusions Continuous microdialysis monitoring of the cerebral drainage in the jugular bulb is feasible and safe. JBMD-to-CMD correlation is influenced by the type of metabolite measured, with glucose and lactate displaying the strongest associations. JBMD lactate correlated more often than CMD lactate to CPP, implying utility for detection of global cerebral metabolic perturbations. Studies comparing JBMD to other global measures of cerebral metabolism, e.g., PET CT or Xenon CT, are warranted.

   MODEL
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
CT International Workshop on Biological Mechanics
CY OCT 17-20, 2017
CL Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB In vehicle side collisions, traumatic brain injury caused by the impact between occupant's head and the interior parts of A or B pillar is a major reason of death and disability. In order to analyze the biomechanical response and injury mechanism of occupant's brain in side collisions, a refined finite element head model representing the 50th percentile Chinese male was developed. Its improvements of biofidelity comparing to the original head model were illustrated through model simulation against the same post mortem human subjects test. Based on the refined head model, the brain biomechanical responses and injuries in the side impact with interior parts of A pillar and B pillar were analyzed according to FMVSS 201U, and the influences of different impact locations and directions were investigated. The results showed that the brain tissues on impact side sustained positive pressure and those on the opposite side experienced negative pressure. The transmission of pressure wave was easy to cause brain concussion and other diffuse brain injuries. The intracranial pressure distribution exhibited a typical pattern of contrecoup injury. The extreme stress concentration in the junction area of the cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem could lead to focal injury such as brain contusion and laceration. Moreover, the impact injury of A pillar was more serious than that of B pillar, which was consistent with the traffic injury statistics that the head injury in oblique side collisions was more serious than that of vertical side collisions. Therefore, the interior parts of A pillar should be designed to absorb more energy than those of B pillar under the same conditions. In addition, the severity of brain injury is more sensitive to the variation of the horizontal angle than that of the vertical angle. Both the peak values of the occipital fossa pressure in effect simulations of the horizontal and vertical angles were three to four times of the peak values of the forehead pressure. When the impact horizontal angle was up to 255 degrees, or the vertical angle was up to 45 degrees, the head HIC(d) values would be up to 1320.45 and 1101.06, respectively, which indicated a AIS 3+ injury risk of the head.

TI Cerebral autoregulation testing after aneurysmal subarachnoid
   hemorrhage: The phase relationship between arterial blood pressure and
   cerebral blood flow velocity
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: Impairment of cerebral autoregulation (CA) appears to he an important cause for secondary ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It has been shown that graded CA impairment is predictive of outcome. Little is known about whether such impairment is present, what causes GA impairment, whether it precedes vasospasm, and whether it is predictive of outcome in patients with severe aneurysmal SAH.
   Design: Prospective, controlled study.
   Setting: Neurosurgical intensive care unit.
   Patients: Twelve patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 40 controls.
   Interventions: Recording of cerebral blood flow Velocities and continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure at a controlled ventilatory frequency of six per minute to standardize the influence of intrathoracic pressure changes on blood pressure.
   Measurements and Main Results: We calculated the phase shift angles (Delta phi degrees) between slow (0.1 Hz) arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity waves measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound in the middle cerebral artery during a) posthemorrhage days (PHD) 1-6 (early or prevasospasm phase), and b) during PHD 7-13 (late or vasospasm phase) using a 6/min ventilation protocol, and in 40 controls spontaneously ventilating at the same rate. Delta phi <30<degrees> indicated lost CA. Mean flow velocities >100 cm/sec were considered vasospasm. We combined early and late measurements to assess the CA relationship with low cerebral perfusion pressure (cPP) and/or vasospasm. We assessed the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at discharge (1 = worst, 5 = best).
   The admission Hunt and Hess score was 3.6 +/- 0.7. GOS scores were n = 3 (GOS 1), n = 2 (GOS 2), n = 5 (GOS 3), n = 1 (GOS 4), and n = 1 (GOS 5). In the early phase, Delta phi was 40.4 +/- 19.8 degrees (left), and 40.4 +/- 19.2 degrees (right). CPP was 69.4 +/- 10.9, intracranial pressure (ICP) was 6.7 +/- 2.8 mm Hg. In the late phase, Delta phi worsened in six patients and none improved: 32.1 +/- 21 degrees (left), and 26.9 +/- 17.2 degrees (right); CPP was 68.1 +/- 12.1, ICP was 7.5 +/- 3.7 mm Hg. GA was significantly impaired in both phases when compared with normal subjects (Delta phi: 65.7 +/- 24.5 degrees; p <.01 for early, p <.001 for late phase). In the early phase, seven of eight patients in whom autoregulation was intact had a GOS >2 at discharge and disturbed GA on at least one side was predictive of either vegetative condition at discharge or death (p <.01). In the late phase, <Delta>phi was no longer predictive of outcome. Spasm was present in 8 of 17 vessels (47%) in which GA was lost; no spasm was found in 25 of 28 vessels (89%) in which CA was intact (p <.01). A low CPP was present in 6 of 17 Vessels (35%) in which CA was lost; a normal CPP was found in 21 of 27 vessels (78%) in which CA was intact (p >.05, NS). However, 14 of 17 vessels (82%) with lost GA showed spasm and/or low CPP while only 8 of 27 Gases (30%) with intact CA had either spasm or low CPP (p <.001).
   Conclusions: CA can he assessed in a graded fashion in SAH patients. GA impairment precedes vasospasm; ongoing vasospasm worsens CA. CA assessment early after subarachnoid hemorrhage, within PHD 1-6, is predictive of outcome whereas late assessment is not. GA impairment is associated with cerebral vasospasm and low CPP.

TI A rare case of tension pneumocephalus after head trauma
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB OBJECTIVES: We present a rare case of tension pneumocephalus (TP) after head trauma not involving mask ventilation but based on pathological respiration pattern, kussmaul breathing.
   TP is rare condition and exceptionally rare when positive airway pressure has not been applied. In this particular case, the vacuum and one-valve intracranial effects causing pneumocephalon were instead accentuated by a pathological pattern of respiration due to severe ketoacidosis - a condition not previously reported in the literature.
   METHODS: This is a case report showing a rare cause of pneumocephalon caused by patients own respiration. We retrospectively reviewed the patients' journal to find the cause of his severe pneumocephalon. The patient has not been ventilated and the only cause of TP in this case seems to be his own rapid and pathological breathing caused by ketoacidosis.
   CONCLUSION: In the presented case, pathologic deep and rapid respiration exerted additional pressure on the dural fistula allowing ambient air at a pressure above ICP to drive itself into the intracranial space. The loss of CSF from skull base fractures created a void space and relative negative pressure, allowing air to bubble in and fill the void. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Trauma Scores and Their Prognostic Value for the Outcome Following
   Pediatric Polytrauma
SO FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB Purpose: The management and prognostic assessment of pediatric polytrauma patients can pose substantial challenges. Trauma scores developed for adults are not universally applicable in children. An accurate prediction of the severity of trauma and correct assessment of the necessity of surgical procedures are important for optimal treatment. Several trauma scores are currently available, but the advantages and drawbacks for use in pediatric patients are unclear. This study examines the value of the trauma scores Injury Severity Score (ISS), Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS), National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) for the assessment of the polytraumatized child.
   Methods: In a retrospective study, 97 patients aged 0-17 years who presented with polytrauma and an ISS >= 16 in the trauma bay were included in the study. Patient records including radiological studies were analyzed. Pathological imaging findings and emergency surgery were assessed as outcome variables and the predictive value of the trauma scores were analyzed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Statistical significance was set at an alpha level of P <= 0.05.
   Results: In this study, 35 of the 97 studied children had pathological cranial computed findings. These either underwent craniectomy or trepanation or a parenchymal catheter was placed for intracranial pressure monitoring. Abdominal trauma was present in 45 patients, 16 of which were treated surgically. Forty-three patients arrived with thoracic injuries, 10 of which received a thoracic drainage. One child underwent an emergency thoracotomy. Predictive accuracy for emergency surgery calculated using receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves was highest for ISS and NACA scores (0,732 and 0.683, respectively), and lower for GCS (0.246) and PTS (0.261).
   Conclusion: In our study cohort, initial ISS and NACA scores better predicted operative interventions and outcome than PTS or GCS for polytraumatized pediatric patients.

TI Compression sonography for non-invasive measurement of lower leg
   compartment pressure in an animal model
SO INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
AB Introduction: Cowcl"a"1mpression ultrasound is a non-invasive technique allowing for qualitative visualization and quantitative measurements of mechanical tissue properties. In acute compartment syndrome (ACS), cadaver studies have proven that the intra-compartmental pressure (ICP) measured by compression sonography correlates with the ICP measured invasively. This study aimed to evaluate compression sonography for compartment pressure measurements in an animal model.
   Material and methods: The pressure in the anterior tibial compartment of 6 domestic pig legs was increased from baseline to 40 mmHg in 5 mmHg steps. Using compression sonography, the compartment diameter was measured without external pressure and during manual application of five levels of external pressure. The elasticity ratio (ER) was computed as the ratio of the compartment diameter with and without external pressure.
   At 40 mmHg of external pressure the ERs at different ICP levels were compared using repeated ANOVA measurements. Post-hoc comparisons evaluated the lowest detectable ICP fulfilling the definition of ACS (ICP >= 30 mmHg) by starting from each pressure below 30 mmHg (baseline, 20 mmHg and 25 mmHg, respectively). Receiver operator characteristic analyses defined ER limits with appropriate sensitivity and specificity to detect ACS.
   Results: The ER increased from 79.0% at baseline ICP to 89.3% at 40 mmHg ICP. The ER at baseline and at 20 mmHg ICP significantly differed from the ER at 30 mmHg ICP (p = 0.007 and 0.002, respectively); the ER at 25 mmHg ICP significantly differed from the ER at 40 mmHg ICP (p = 0.001). An ER less than 87.1% had a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 88.9% to proper diagnosis of ACS.
   Conclusion: Compression sonography might offer a non-invasive technique to guide treatment in cases of uncertain acute compartment syndrome. Further studies are needed to collect elasticity ratio data in humans and to clinically validate compression sonography for compartment pressure measurements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Development of a large-animal model to measure dynamic cerebrospinal
   fluid pressure during spinal cord injury
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-SPINE
AB Object. Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in considerable permanent neurological impairment, and unfortunately, the successful translation of effective treatments from laboratory models to human patients is lacking. This may be partially attributed to differences in anatomy, physiology, and scale between humans and rodent models. One potentially important difference between the rodent and human spinal cord is the presence of a significant CSF volume within the intrathecal space around the human cord. While the CSF may "cushion" the spinal cord, pressure waves within the CSF at the time of injury may contribute to the extent and severity of the primary injury. The objective of this study was to develop a model of contusion SCI in a miniature pig and establish the feasibility of measuring spinal CSF pressure during injury.
   Methods. A custom weight-drop device was used to apply thoracic contusion SCI! to 17 Yucatan miniature pigs. Impact load and velocity were measured. Using fiber optic pressure transducers implanted in the thecal sac, CSF pressures resulting from 2 injury severities (caused by 50-g and 100-g weights released from a 50-cm height) were measured.
   Results. The median peak impact loads were 54 N and 132 N for the 50-g and 100-g injuries, respectively. At a nominal 100 mm from the injury epicenter, the authors observed a small negative pressure peak (median -4.6 mm Hg [cranial] and -5.8 mm Hg [caudal] for 50 g; -27.6 mm Hg [cranial] and -27.2 mm Hg [caudal] for 100 g) followed by a larger positive pressure peak (median 110.5 mm Hg [cranial] and 77.1 mm Hg [caudal] for 50 g; 88.4 mm Hg [cranial] and 67.2 mm Hg [caudal] for 100 g) relative to the preinjury pressure. There were no significant differences in peak pressure between the 2 injury severities or the caudal and cranial transducer locations.
   Conclusions. A new model of contusion SCI was developed to measure spinal CSF pressures during the SCI event. The results suggest that the Yucatan miniature pig is an appropriate model for studying CSF, spinal cord, and dura interactions during injury. With further development and characterization it may be an appropriate in vivo large-animal model of SCI to answer questions regarding pathological changes, therapeutic safety, or treatment efficacy, particularly where humanlike dimensions and physiology are important.

TI Nonhuman primate model of persistent erectile and urinary dysfunction
   following radical prostatectomy: Feasibility of minimally invasive
   therapy
SO NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS
AB ObjectivePersistent urinary incontinence (UI) and/or erectile dysfunction (ED) occur in 30-50% of post-radical prostatectomy patients regardless of nerve sparing approaches. Identification of potential treatment options for these patients will require testing in an animal model that develops these chronic conditions. The objective was to characterize a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of persistent post-prostatectomy ED and UI and then test the feasibility of periurethral injection of the chemokine CXCL-12.
   MethodsTen adult male cynomolgus monkeys were used. Two were used for study of normal male nonhuman primate genitourinary anatomy. Five were used for measures of sexual behavior, peak intra-corporal pressure (ICP), abdominal leak point pressures (ALPP) 3 and 6-months post open radical prostatectomy (ORP). Three additional ORP animals received ultrasound-guided peri-urethral injection of chemokine CXCL12 6 weeks after ORP, and UI/ED evaluated for up to 3 months.
   ResultsThe anatomy, innervation, and vascular supply to the prostate and surrounding tissues of these male NHPs are substantially similar to those of human beings. ORP resulted in complete removal of the prostate gland along with both neurovascular bundles and seminal vesicles while permitting stable restoration of vesico-urethral patency. ORP produced sustained (6 months) decreases in ALPP, ICP's, and sexual function. Transurethral injection of chemokine CXCL12 was feasible and had beneficial effects on erectile and urinary function.
   ConclusionsORP in NHPs produced persistent erectile and urinary tract dysfunction. Periurethral injection of CXCL-12 was feasible and improved both urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction and suggests that this model can be used to test new approaches for both conditions.

TI Changes of cerebrospinal fluid pressure after thoracic endovascular
   aortic repair
SO CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Background Decreasing the intracranial pressure has been advocated as one of the major protective strategies to prevent spinal cord ischemia after endovascular aortic repair. However, the actual changes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and its relation with spinal cord ischemia have been poorly understood. We performed CSF pressure measurements and provisional CSF withdrawal after thoracic endovascular aortic repair, and compared the changes of CSF pressure in high risk patients and in patients with new onset paraplegia and paraparesis.
   Methods Four hundred and nineteen patients were evaluated for the risk of spinal cord ischemia after thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Patients with identified risk factors before the procedure constituted group H and received prophylactic sequential CSF pressure measurement and CSF withdrawal. Patients who actually developed spinal cord ischemia constituted group P and received rescue CSF pressure measurements and CSF withdrawal.
   Results Among the 419 patients evaluated, 17 were graded as high risk. Four patients actually developed spinal cord ischemia after endovascular repair. The incidence of spinal cord ischemia in this investigation was 0.9%. The patients who actually developed spinal cord ischemia had no identified risk factors and had elevated CSF pressure, ranging from 15.4 to 30.0 mmHg. Six of the 17 patients graded as high risk had elevated CSF pressure: >20 mmHg in two patients and >15 mmHg in four patients. Sequential CSF pressure measurements and provisional withdrawal successfully decrease CSF pressure and prevented symptomatic spinal cord ischemia in high-risk patients. However, these measurements could only successfully reverse the neurologic deficit in two of the patients who actually developed spinal cord ischemia.
   Conclusions Cerebrospinal fluid pressure was elevated in patients with spinal cord ischemia after thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Sequential measurements of CSF pressure and provisional withdrawal of CSF decreased CSF pressure effectively in high risk patients and provided effective prevention of spinal cord ischemia. Risk factor identification and prophylactic measurements play the key role in prevention of spinal cord ischemia after thoracic endovascular aortic repair.

TI Cerebral Venous Sirius Thrombosis in Adults with Prothrombotic
   Conditions: A Systematic Review and a Case from Our Institution
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare condition characterized by elevated intracranial pressure due to impaired cerebral venous drainage, potentially leading to life-threatening consequences. We searched the PubMed electronic database for 'cerebral venous sinus thrombosis' and 'prothrombotic' cases reported in adults (19+ years) and conducted a systematic review for the published literature in the English language pooled with a case from our institution. Data were analyzed regarding patient demographics, risk factors, clinical features, treatment modalities, and outcomes when available.
   Thirty cases of CVST were identified (29 case reports, of whom two were described in a case series, and the one case from our institution). The patients' mean age was 39 years (range: 19 - 65). The male: female ratio was 1.14:1. The majority (73.3%) had at least one preexisting risk factor, with prescription drug use being the most common risk factor (33.3%) shared among all patients. Most patients (83.3%) presented with at least two symptoms. The most common presenting symptoms were headache (70%), gastrointestinal disturbance (50%), and seizures (40%). Focal deficits (36.796), vision disturbances (30%), and altered consciousness (20%) were the remaining presenting complaints. Twelve cases (40%) commented on papilledema, with 10 (83.3%) having papilledema present. Anticoagulation abnormalities were examined in 26 cases (86.7%), out of which four cases (15.496) had isolated protein S (PS) deficiency, three cases (11.596) had isolated antithromhin III (ATIII) deficiency, and one case (3.8%) had isolated protein C (PC) deficiency. The most common initial imaging modality (22 cases, 73.3%), and most commonly used overall (23 cases, 76.796), was computed tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the second most common imaging modality for initial use (five cases, 16.7%), diagnosis or confirmation of CVST (eight cases, 26.7%), and overall (21 cases, 70%). Heparin treatment was involved in the treatment of 18 cases (6096), and warfarin treatment was used in 10 cases (33.3%). Heparin-warfarin combination treatment was utilized in eight cases (26.796). Most patients survived (28 cases, 93.3%), while the two remaining patients died secondary to brain death from the CVST (6.796).
   The findings from this study highlight the clinical characteristics of CVST. Therefore, this study aims to increase awareness of this rare entity. Physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in order to diagnose patients presenting in the proper clinical context, given this ease shares various forms of presentations with other common clinical conditions but requires long-term anticoagulation.

TI Effect of body mass index on outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid
   hemorrhage treated with clipping versus coiling
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE It has been suggested that increased body mass index (BMI) may confer a protective effect on patients who suffer from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Whether the modality of aneurysm occlusion influences the effect of BMI on patient outcomes is not well understood. The authors aimed to compare the effect of BMI on outcomes for patients with aSAH treated with surgical clipping versus endovascular coiling.
   METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the outcomes for patients admitted to their institution for the management of aSAH treated with either clipping or coiling. BMI at the time of admission was recorded and used to assign patients to a group according to low or high BMI. Cutoff values for BMI were determined by classification and regression tree analysis. Predictors of poor functional outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score > 2 measured >= 90 days after the ictus) and posttreatment cerebral hypodensities detected during admission were then determined separately for patients treated with clipping or coiling using stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS Of the 469 patients admitted to the authors' institution with aSAH who met the study's inclusion criteria, 144 were treated with clipping and 325 were treated with coiling. In the clipping group, the frequency of poor functional outcome was higher in patients with BMI >= 32.3 kg/m(2) (47.6% vs 19.0%; p = 0.007). In contrast, in the coiling group, patients with BMI >= 32.3 kg/m(2) had a lower frequency of poor functional outcome at >= 90 days (5.8% vs 30.9%; p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, high BMI was independently associated with an increased (OR 3.92, 95% CI 1.20-13.41; p = 0.024) and decreased (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.40; p < 0.001) likelihood of poor functional outcome for patients treated with clipping and coiling, respectively. For patients in the surgical group, BMI >= 28.4 kg/m(2) was independently associated with incidence of cerebral hypodensities during admission (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.16-5.25; p = 0.018) on multivariate analysis. For patients treated with coiling, BMI >= 33.2 kg/m(2) was independently associated with reduced odds of hypodensities (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.89; p = 0.021).
   CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that BMI may differentially affect functional outcomes after aSAH, depending on treatment modality. These findings may aid in treatment selection for patients with aSAH.

TI OVERDRAINAGE AND SHUNT TECHNOLOGY - A CRITICAL COMPARISON OF
   PROGRAMMABLE, HYDROSTATIC AND VARIABLE RESISTANCE VALVES AND
   FLOW-REDUCING DEVICES
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB When vertical body position is simulated, conventional differential pressure valves show an absolutely unphysiological flow, which is 2-170 times the normal liquor production rate. Although this is compensated in part by the resistance of the silicon tubes, which may produce up to 94% of the resistance of the complete shunt system, a negative intracranial pressure (ICP) of up to 30-44 cmH(2)O is an unavoidable consequence, which can be followed by subdural hematomas, slit ventricles, and other well-known complications. Modern shunt technology offers programmable, hydrostatic, and ''flow-controlled'' valves and anti-siphon devices; we have tested 13 different designs from 7 manufacturers (56 specimens), using the ''Heidelberg Valve Test Inventory'' with 16 subtests. ''Programmable'' valves reduce, but cannot exclude, unphysiological flow rates: even in the highest position and in combination with a standard catheter typical programmable Medos-Hakim valves allow a flow of 93-232 ml/h, Sophy SU-8-valves 86-168 ml/h with 30 cmH(2)O. The effect of hydrostatic valves (Hakim-Lumbar, Chhabra) can be inactivated by movements of daily life. The weight of the metal balls in most valves was too low for adequate flow reduction. Anti-siphon devices are highly dependent on external, i.e. subcutaneous, pressure which has unpredictable influences on shunt function, and clinically is sometimes followed by shunt insufficiency. Two new Orbis-Sigma valves showed relatively physiological flow rates even when the vertical position (30 cmH(2)O) was simulated. One showed an insufficient flow (5.7 ml/h), and one was primarily obstructed. These have by far the smallest outlet of all valves. Additionally, the ruby pin tends to stick. Therefore, a high susceptibility to obliterations and blockade is unavoidable. Encouraging results obtained in pediatric patients contrast with disappointing experiences in some German and Swedish hospitals, which suggests that our laboratory findings are confirmed by clinical results. The concept of strict flow limitation seems to be inadaequate for adult patients, who need a relatively high flow during (nocturnal) ICP crises. The problem of shunt overdrainage remains unsolved.

TI Pituitary enlargement in patients with cerebrospinal fluid drainage due
   to ventricular shunt insertion: know the condition and do not mistake
   for adenoma
SO PITUITARY
AB ObjectiveChildhood hydrocephalus patients treated by ventriculo-peritoneal (v.-p.) shunting are sometimes referred years after this therapy for evaluation of suspicious pituitary enlargement. Since pituitary size has been shown to depend on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, we assume this phenomenon to be caused by shunt overdrainage. Therefore, we studied pituitary size and morphology in shunted hydrocephalus patients with radiological signs of high CSF drainage.Patients and methodsRetrospective study of pituitary size and morphology in 15 shunted patients with non-tumoral hydrocephalus and 7 shunted hydrocephalus patients due to childhood brain tumor compared to a population mean. In five brain tumor patients also pre- and postsurgical comparisons were performed.ResultsPituitary mid-sagittal size and pituitary volume were significantly higher in both hydrocephalus groups, compared to the population mean (midsagittal size t = 5.91; p < 0.001; pituitary volume, t = 3.03; p = 0.006). In patients available for pre- and postoperative comparison, there was also a significant increase in pituitary size and volume postoperatively (mean preoperative midsagittal height 2.54 +/- 1.0 mm vs. 6.6 +/- 0.7 mm post-surgery; mean pre-operative pituitary volume 120.5 +/- 69.2 mm(3) vs. 368.9 +/- 57.9 mm(3) post-surgery).ConclusionOur results confirmed a significant increase in pituitary size and volume, mimicking pituitary pathology, after v.-p. shunt insertion. This phenomenon can be explained by the Monro-Kellie doctrine, stating that intracranial depletion of CSF-as caused by v.p. shunting-leads to compensatory intracranial hyperemia, especially in the venous system, with the consequence of engorged venous sinuses, most likely responsible for enlargement of the pituitary gland.

TI IMAGING OF THE APPARENT DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT FOR THE EVALUATION OF
   CEREBRAL METABOLIC RECOVERY AFTER CARDIAC-ARREST
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
AB The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water is a sensitive indicator of water and ion homeostasis of brain. Resuscitation of the brain after cardiac arrest, the most frequent reason for global cerebral ischemia under clinical conditions, depends critically on the reversal of disturbances of water and ion homeostasis. We, therefore, investigated whether ADC imaging can be used to monitor the development and reversal of ischemic brain injury during and after cardiac arrest. Ten adult mongrel normothermic cats were anesthetized with alfentanil and midazolam, immobilized with pancuronium, and mechanically ventilated with O-2/N2O. Arterial, left ventricular, central venous, and intracranial pressures were monitored throughout the experiment. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in a 4.7T MR scanner with a shielded gradient system. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were obtained by pulsed gradient spin echoes (diffusion weighting factor b: 0, 500, 1000, 1500 s/mm(2)). Quantitative ADC images were calculated from DWIs by fitting signal intensities against b-factors. Fifteen minute cardiac arrest was induced in the magnet by electrical fibrillation. Resuscitation was also carried out in the magnet, using a pneumatic vest for remotely controlled closed chest cardiac massage. Seven of 10 animals were resuscitated successfully and subsequently monitored for 3 h. During cardiac arrest, ADC declined from 678 +/- 79 x 10(-6) to 430 +/- 128 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s (63% of baseline). In the successfully resuscitated animals ADC returned to 648 +/- 108 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s within 30 min and remained at this level throughout the 3 h of recirculation. Regional evaluations of ADC revealed a transient overshoot in brainstem and basal ganglia to 114% of control at 15 min before returning to baseline values after 40 min. Failure of cardiac resuscitation prevented ADC normalization and led to its further decline to below 50% of control. Postcardiac arrest normalization of ADC maps correlated with homogeneous return of ATP, glucose, and lactate to near normal, whereas failure of ADC normalization was associated with depletion of ATP and glucose and severe lactate accumulation. In conclusion, our data indicate, that normalization of ADC is a reliable indicator of cerebral recovery after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.

TI Development of clinical decision support for patients older than 65
   years with fall-related TBI using artificial intelligence modeling
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background Older persons comprise most traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related hospitalizations and deaths and are particularly susceptible to fall-induced TBIs. The combination of increased frailty and susceptibility to clinical decline creates a significant ongoing challenge in the management of geriatric TBI. As the population ages and co-existing medical conditions complexify, so does the need to improve the quality of care for this population. Utilizing early hospital admission variables, this study will create and validate a multinomial decision tree that predicts the discharge disposition of older patients with fall-related TBI.Methods From the National Trauma Data Bank, we retrospectively analyzed 11,977 older patients with a fall-related TBI (2017-2021). Clinical variables included Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, intracranial pressure monitor use, venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, and initial vital signs. Outcomes included hospital discharge disposition re-categorized into home, care facility, or deceased. Data were split into two sets, where 80% developed a decision tree, and 20% tested predictive performance. We employed a conditional inference tree algorithm with bootstrap (B = 100) and grid search options to grow the decision tree and measure discrimination ability using the area under the curve (AUC) and calibration plots.Results Our decision tree used seven admission variables to predict the discharge disposition of older TBI patients. Significant non-modifiable variables included total GCS and injury severity scores, while VTE prophylaxis type was the most important interventional variable. Patients who did not receive VTE prophylaxis treatment had a higher probability of death. The predictive performance of the tree in terms of AUC value (95% confidence intervals) in the training cohort for death, care, and home were 0.66 (0.65-0.67), 0.75 (0.73-0.76), and 0.77 (0.76-0.79), respectively. In the test cohort, the values were 0.64 (0.62-0.67), 0.75 (0.72-0.77), and 0.77 (0.73-0.79).Conclusions We have developed and internally validated a multinomial decision tree to predict the discharge destination of older patients with TBI. This tree could serve as a decision support tool for caregivers to manage older patients better and inform decision-making. However, the tree must be externally validated using prospective data to ascertain its predictive and clinical importance.

TI Progress in techniques of interfacing capillary electrophoresis with
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
SO SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
AB The coupling of capillary electrophoresis (CE) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has demonstrated multiple advantages, including high separation efficiency, sensitivity and resolution, as well as low sample consumption and detection limit. The technique has been widely used for the speciation of environmental and biological samples. The interface between CE and the nebulizing system of ICP-MS plays a key role in the hyphenation of CE and ICP-MS. The most important factors in the interface design were reviewed in this paper, including electrical connections, nebulizer designs and flow compensation in the nebulizer system. Methods for achieving stable electrical current within the capillary were discussed, including the employment of concentric sheath flow, stainless steel components, platinum wire and silver paint. The structures and performance of various nebulizer designs were reviewed and compared, including the concentric pneumatic nebulizer (CPN), micro concentric nebulizer (MCN), high efficiency nebulizer (HEN), ultrasonic nebulizer (USN) and direct injection nebulizer (DIN). To eliminate nebulizer suction, four compensations systems were suggested, including applying a negative pressure at the inlet of the capillary, putting a sol-gel frit at the outlet of the capillary, pumping an appropriate make-up flow to the interface and adjusting the height of the make-up flow. 35 papers were cited.

TI CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW AUTOREGULATION AND TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER SONOGRAPHY
   IN PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS
SO HEPATOLOGY
AB Impairment of cerebral blood now (CBF) autoregulation may have serious implications for patients with cirrhosis if arterial hypotension occurs during coma, anesthesia, bleeding, or sepsis. In this study, CBF autoregulation was investigated in patients with cirrhosis with no or mild encephalopathy. Ten patients (median age, 45 years; range, 30 to 61 years) and six healthy volunteers (median age, 30 years; range, 21 to 61 years) were included. Catheters were placed in a radial artery and in the internal jugular vein. Baseline CBF was measured using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with concomitant measurements of cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content differences (AVDO(2)). CBF autoregulation was evaluated using the AVDO(2) method and changes in mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V-mean) as determined by transcranial Doppler (TCD). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was increased by 30 mm Hg by intravenous norepinephrine, and subsequently decreased by a combination of lower body negative pressure and ganglion blockade, whereas AVDO(2) and V-mean were measured at each 5 mm Hg change in MAP. CBF was 61 (range, 45 to 78) mL 100 g(-1) min(-1) in patients with cirrhosis and 65 (range, 53 to 88) mL 100 g(-1) min(-1) in volunteers (not significant [NS]). There were no regional differences in CBF between the two groups. Arterial carbon dioxide tension was 31 (23 to 35) mm Hg in patients with cirrhosis and lower, com pared with 36 (range, 34 to 37) mm Hg in the volunteers (P <.01). For evaluation of autoregulation, MAP was raised to 116 (range 100 to 145) and then decreased to 39 (range, 34 to 50) mm Hg. In 8 of 10 patients with cirrhosis, a lower limit of autoregulation of 74 (range 64 to 103) mm Hg was identified, similar to the value of 74 (range, 53 to 79) mm Hg in the controls. In the two remaining patients with cirrhosis, no lower limit could be established. A statistically significant correlation between V-mean and CBF below the lower limit of autoregulation was found in patients with cirrhosis (CBF = 22 + 0.75 . V-mean; r(2) =.60; P <.005). CBF autoregulatory capacity seems generally preserved in patients with cirrhosis but the lower limit may be impaired in some patients and can be reliably evaluated using TCD sonography.

TI Middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, end-tidal
   <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and blood pressure in patients with obstructive
   sleep apnea and in healthy subjects during continuous positive airway
   pressure breathing
SO NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB There is conflicting evidence in the literature as to the potential effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) an cerebral perfusion. Compromising cerebral perfusion could possibly outweigh the benefit of improved oxygenation. Patients with the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) have been claimed to have a higher cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in end-tidal pCO(2). In this study, we investigated 23 patients with OSAS and 16 healthy young adults in the waking state. Both groups performed a series of 10 min of normal breathing, 20 min with 9 cmH(2)O nasal CPAP and then 10 min of normal breathing while wearing a nasal CPAP mask. The following parameters were assessed: bilateral transcranial Doppler signal of the middle cerebral artery, systolic and diastolic blood pressure assessed manually, and cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in pCO(2) during hyperventilation and rebreathing into an airbag. Continuous end-tidal pCO(2) measurements were performed in 14 subjects. As compared with normal breathing middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity and pCO(2) remained unchanged during CPAP. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased slightly by 1.2 mmHg (p = 0.015) and 1.1 mmHg (p = 0.007), respectively. Cerebrovascular reactivity did not differ in the two groups. Nasal CPAP of 9 cmH(2)O is a safe treatment with respect to the maintenance of cerebral blood flow Our study gives further evidence for the autoregulation's capacity to maintain cerebral blood now velocity constant during different levels of intrathoracic pressure and different cerebral perfusion pressures. We could not demonstrate any difference in cerebrovascular reactivity between patients with OSAS and healthy persons.

TI Early Mobilization in Neurocritical Care
SO CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Purpose of ReviewBed rest was a treatment recommended for critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) that aimed to minimize energy expenditure, permit wound healing and minimize somatic stressors. However, evidence demonstrates that bed rest leads to disuse atrophy, which may be compounded by premorbid sarcopenia and ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW). ICUAW partly results from muscle breakdown and systemic inflammation and may exacerbate critical illness. Coupled with analgosedation, ICUAW may prolong mechanical ventilation (Kho et al. in BMJ Open Respir Res. 2019;6(1) 2019; Maffei et al. in Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2017;98 2017; McWilliams et al. in J Crit Care. 2018;44 2018; Sarfati et al. in J Crit Care. 2018;46 2018), increase risk of venous thromboembolism (Denehy et al. in Intensive Care Med. 2017;43(1) 2017; Lyles in J Am Geriatr Soc. 1988;36(11) 1988) create dependence on vasopressor agents (Lyles in J Am Geriatr Soc. 1988;36(11) 1988; Fortney et al. in Comprehen Physiol. 1996) restrict joint mobility, and induce pressure injuries. Neurologically injured patients may be at a higher risk of ICUAW than other critically-ill patients, given that neurological injury itself results in weakness, which may be focal or generalized. Early mobilization (EM), typically defined as physical therapy within 72 h of ICU (Cumming et al. in Neurology. 2019;93(7) 2019), may preempt or mitigate these deleterious consequences of critical care.Recent FindingsRetrospective data suggest that EM protocols reduce ventilator days, decrease venous thromboembolism, avert pressure wounds, and reduce the length of stay. EM may reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of delirium (Morris et al. in Crit Care Med. 2008;36(8) 2008; Needham et al. in Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2010;91(4) 2010). Larger and more rigorous studies have not demonstrated benefit of EM on outcomes after critical care; some have demonstrated harm. Neurologically injured critical care patients have generally been excluded from early mobilization protocols due to safety concerns that stem from the increased potential for falls, disorders of consciousness, cognitive impairment, intracranial hypertension, and potential dislodgment of intracranial devices. Notably, data from patients with ischemic stroke suggest that EM may also be associated with harm in this group.SummaryEM may benefit neurologically injured patients once acute ischemia, elevated ICP, and seizures are resolved. Targeting moderate acuity patients may be critical to improving outcomes and optimizing resource utilization in this resource-intensive intervention. The duration of mobility session, optimal frequency of mobility session, and timing of session remain to be determined.

TI Head midline position for preventing the occurrence or extension of
   germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB Background
   Preterm birth is known to constitute the major risk factor for development of germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GM-IVH). Head position may affect cerebral hemodynamics and thus may be involved indirectly in development of GM-IVH. Turning the head toward one side may functionally occlude jugular venous drainage on the ipsilateral side while increasing intracranial pressure and cerebral blood volume. Thus, it has been suggested that cerebral venous pressure is reduced and hydrostatic brain drainage improved if the patient is in supine midline position with the bed tilted 30 degrees. The midline position might be achieved in the supine position and, with the use of physical aids, in the lateral position as well. Midline position should be kept, at least when the incidence of GM-IVH is greatest, that is, during the first two to three days of life.
   Objectives
   Primary objective
   To assess whether head midline position is more effective than any other head position for preventing or extending germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants born at <= 32 weeks' gestational age.
   Secondary objectives
   To perform subgroup analyses regarding gestational age, birth weight, intubated versus not intubated, and with or without GM-IVH at trial entry.
   Search methods
   We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to September 19, 2016), Embase (1980 to September 19,. 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to September 19, 2016). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized clinical controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials, and cluster-randomized controlled trials comparing placing very preterm infants in a head midline position versus placing them in a prone or lateral decubitus position, or undertaking a strategy of regular position change, or having no prespecified position. We included trials enrolling infants with existing GM-IVH and planned to assess extension of hemorrhage in a subgroup of infants. We planned to analyze horizontal (flat) versus head elevated positions separately for all body positions.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g., number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, initiation and duration of head midline position, co-intervention with horizontal vs head elevated position, use of physical aids to maintain head position) and assessed risk of bias (e.g., adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow-up). The primary outcomes considered in this review are GM-IVH, severe IVH, and neonatal death.
   Main results
   Our search strategy yielded 2696 references. Two review authors independently assessed all references for inclusion. Two randomized controlled trials, for a total of 110 infants, met the inclusion criteria of this review. Both trials compared supine midline head position with the bed at 0 degrees versus supine head rotated 90 degrees with the bed at 0 degrees. We found no trials that compared supine versus prone midline head position, and no trials that compared effects of head tilting. We found no significant differences in rates of GM-IVH (typical risk ratio [RR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 2.35; typical risk difference [RD] 0.03, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.18; two studies, 110 infants; I-2 = 0% for RR and I-2 = 0% for RD), severe IVH (typical RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.98; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.10; two studies, 110 infants; I2 = 0% for RR and I2 = 0% for RD), and neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.65; typical RD -0.07, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.05; two studies, 110 infants; I-2 = 28% for RR and I2 = 44% for RD). Among secondary outcomes, we found no significant differences in terms of cystic periventricular leukomalacia (one study; RR 3.25, 95% CI 0.14 to 76.01; RD 0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.15), retinopathy of prematurity (one study; RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.85 to 6.11; RD 0.25, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.53), and severe retinopathy of prematurity (one study; RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 24.14; RD 0.09, 95% CI - 0.09 to 0.26). None of the included trials reported on the other specified outcomes of this review (i.e., cerebellar hemorrhage, brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, impairment in cerebral hemodynamics, long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, and major neurodevelopmental disability). The quality of evidence supporting these findings is limited owing to the imprecision of the estimates. We identified no ongoing studies.
   Authors' conclusions
   Given the imprecision of the estimate, results of this systematic review are consistent with beneficial or detrimental effects of a supine head midline position versus a lateral position and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question.

TI Adherence to Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations on Low-Value
   Injury Care: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study
SO VALUE IN HEALTH
AB Objectives: Low-value clinical practices have been identified as one of the most important areas of excess healthcare spending. Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap on the scale of this problem in injury care. We aimed to identify clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations pertaining to low-value injury care, estimate how frequently they are used in practice, and evaluate interhospital variations in their use. Methods: We identified low-value clinical practices from internationally recognized CPGs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from a Canadian trauma system (2014-2019) to calculate frequencies and assess interhospital variations. Results: We identified 29 low-value practices. Fourteen could be measured using trauma registry data. The 3 low-value clinical practices with the highest absolute and relative frequencies were computed tomography (CT) in adults with minor head injury (n = 5591, 24%), cervical spine CT (n = 2742, 31%), and whole-body CT in minor or single-system trauma (n = 530, 32%). We observed high interhospital variation for decompressive craniectomy in diffuse traumatic brain injury. Frequencies and interhospital variations were low for magnetic resonance imaging, intracranial pressure monitoring, inferior vena cava filter use, and surgical management of blunt abdominal injuries. Conclusions: We observed evidence of poor adherence to CPG recommendations on low-value CT imaging and high practice variation for decompressive craniectomy. Results suggest that adherence to recommendations for the 10 other low-value practices is high. These data can be used to advance the research agenda on low-value injury care and inform the development of interventions targeting reductions in healthcare overuse in this population.

TI Brain Hypoxia Is Associated With Neuroglial Injury in Humans
   Post-Cardiac Arrest
SO CIRCULATION RESEARCH
AB RATIONALE: Secondary brain hypoxia portends significant mortality in ischemic brain diseases; yet, our understanding of hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIBI) pathophysiology in humans remains rudimentary.
   OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of secondary brain hypoxia on injury to the neurovascular unit in patients with HIBI.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective interventional study of invasive neuromonitoring in 18 post-cardiac arrest patients with HIBI. The partial pressures of brain tissue O-2 (PbtO(2)) and intracranial pressure were directly measured via intraparenchymal microcatheters. To isolate the cerebrovascular bed, we conducted paired sampling of arterial and jugular venous bulb blood and calculated the transcerebral release of biomarkers of neurovascular injury and inflammation in the patients with HIBI and 14 healthy volunteers for control comparisons. Ten patients with HIBI exhibited secondary brain hypoxia (PbtO(2)<20 mmHg), while 8 exhibited brain normoxia (PbtO(2)>= 20 mmHg). In the patients with secondary brain hypoxia, we observed active cerebral release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (-161 [-3695 to -75] pg/mL; P=0.0078), neurofilament light chain (-231 [-370 to -11] pg/mL; P=0.010), total tau (-32 [-310 to -3] pg/mL; P=0.0039), neuron-specific enolase (-14 890 [-148 813 to -3311] pg/mL; P=0.0039), and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (-14.7 [-37.7 to -4.1] pg/mL; P=0.0059) indicating de novo neuroglial injury. This injury was unrelated to the systemic global ischemic burden or cerebral endothelial injury but rather was associated with cerebral release of IL-6 (interleukin-6; -10.3 [-43.0 to -4.2] pg/mL; P=0.0039). No cerebral release of the aforementioned biomarkers was observed in patients with HIBI with brain normoxia or the healthy volunteers. Hyperosmolar therapy in the patients with secondary brain hypoxia reduced the partial pressure of jugular venous O-2-to-PbtO(2) gradient (39.6 [34.1-51.1] versus 32.0 [24.5-39.2] mm Hg; P=0.0078) and increased PbtO(2) (17.0 [9.1-19.7] versus 20.2 [11.9-22.7] mm Hg; P=0.039) suggesting improved cerebrovascular-to-parenchymal O-2 transport.
   CONCLUSIONS: Secondary brain hypoxia is associated with de novo neuroglial injury and cerebral release of IL-6. Mitigating cerebrovascular-to-parenchymal limitations to O-2 transport is a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with HIBI with secondary brain hypoxia.

TI Elimination of suction effect in interfacing microchip electrophoresis
   with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry using porous
   monolithic plugs
SO ANALYST
AB A suction-free interfacing method was developed for microchip electrophoresis hyphenated with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MCE-ICP-MS). The hyphenated system was composed of a microchip, a demountable capillary microflow nebulizer (d-CMN) combined with a heated single pass spray chamber, a negative pressure sampling device, a high voltage power supply, a syringe pump and an ICP-MS. To eliminate the nebulizer suction generated by the pneumatic nebulizer and to ensure that the makeup solution flowed into the nebulizer, two porous polymer plugs were fabricated in the microchip. As a result, reasonably true electropherograms were obtained when compared to the CE separation performed in the traditional MCE-ICP-MS mode without porous polymer plugs. Electrophoretic separation of I I- and IO3- was achieved within 25 s in a microchip with an effective separation length of only 15 mm at an electric field of 857 V cm(-1) using 10 mmol L-1 borate (pH 9.2) as the running buffer. A resolution of 1.3 was obtained and the absolute detection limits for I- and IO3- were 0.12 and 0.13 fg, respectively. The precisions (RSD, n = 10) of the migration time and peak height for I- and IO3- were in the range of 1.1-1.6% and 2.5-2.8%, respectively. Two table salt samples were analyzed by an external calibration method. The iodate contents were in accordance with their labeled values. The recoveries of I- and IO3- in the table salt samples were in the range

TI Rapid and selective detection of Hg(ii) in water using AuNP<i>in
   situ</i>-modified filter paper by a head-space solid phase extraction
   Zeeman atomic absorption spectroscopy method
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB In this work, Au nanoparticle (AuNP)-modified filter paper as a highly sensitive mercury extractant was successfully preparedin situand applied in the head-space solid phase extraction (HS-SPE) of Hg(ii) in water. The microstructure of the modified filter paper was characterized by using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (XRD/SEM), and the results showed that AuNPs were well distributed on the fiber surface of the filter paper. Combined with portable Zeeman atomic absorption spectroscopy (ZAAS), the modified filter paper was successfully applied to Hg detection in water samples. Specifically, it can easily achievein situsample collection and detection under negative pressure in the field, which was reported for the first time. Several influencing factors such as extraction temperature, time, stirring speed, pH value, reductants, inorganic ions, and organic interfering and complexing agents were all investigated thoroughly. The limit of detection (LOD) for Hg(ii) was 0.09 mu g L-1, with linearity ranging from 0.09 to 50 mu g L-1. Good recoveries were also obtained between 82 and 106% with RSDs below 7% in real water samples. The established method provided a convenient route for mercury detection in environmental water with a low amount of sample required (1 mL) and good detection performance, which is comparable to that of ICP-MS.

TI Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in children:: risk factors,
   presentation, diagnosis and outcome
SO BRAIN
AB Neuroimaging and management advances require review of indications for excluding cerebral venous sinus (sinovenous) thrombosis (CSVT) in children. Our goals were to examine (i) clinical presentations of CSVT, (ii) prothrombotic risk factors and other predisposing events, (iii) clinical and radiological features of brain lesions in CSVT compared with arterial stroke, and (iv) predictors of outcome. We studied 42 children with CSVT from five European paediatric neurology stroke registries. Patients aged from 3 weeks to 13 (median 5.75) years (27 boys; 64%) presented with lethargy, anorexia, headache, vomiting, seizures, focal signs or coma and with CSVT on neuroimaging. Seventeen had prior chronic conditions; of the 25 previously well patients, 23 had recent infections, eight became dehydrated and six had both. Two children had a history compatible with prior CSVT. Anaemia and/or microcytosis (21 probable iron deficiency, five haemolytic, including two with sickle cell disease and one with beta-thalassaemia) was as common (62%) as prothrombotic disorder (13/21 screened). High factor VIII and homozygosity for the thermolabile methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism were the commonest prothrombotic disorders. The superficial venous system was involved in 32 patients, the deep in six, and both in four. Data on the 13 children with bland infarction and the 12 with haemorrhage in the context of CSVT were compared with those from 88 children with ischaemic (AIS) and 24 with haemorrhagic (AHS) arterial stroke. In multiple logistic regression, iron deficiency, parietal infarction and lack of caudate involvement independently predicted CSVT rather than arterial disease. Five patients died, three acutely, one after recurrence and one after 6 months being quadriparetic and blind. Follow-up ranged from 0.5 to 10 (median 1) years. Twenty-six patients (62%) had sequelae: pseudotumour cerebri in 12 and cognitive and/or behavioural disabilities in 14, associated with epilepsy in three, hemiparesis in two and visual problems in two. Eighteen patients, including six with haemorrhage, were anticoagulated. Older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.54, 95% confidence limits (CI) 1.12, 2.13, P = 0.008], lack of parenchymal abnormality (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02, 1.56, P = 0.1), anticoagulation (OR 24.2, 95% CI 1.96, 299) and lateral and/or sigmoid sinus involvement (OR 16.2, 95% CI 1.62, 161, P = 0.02) were independent predictors of good cognitive outcome, although the last predicted pseudotumour cerebri. Death was associated with coma at presentation. Of 19 patients with follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) venography, three had persistent occlusion, associated with anaemia and longer prodrome. A low threshold for CT or MR venography in children with acute neurological symptoms is essential. Nutritional deficiencies may be modifiable risk factors. A paediatric anticoagulation trial may be required, after the natural history has been further established from registries of cases with and without treatment.

TI Regulation of cerebral blood flow in patients with autonomic dysfunction
   and severe postural hypotension
SO CLINICAL PHYSIOLOGY AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING
AB Background: Whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation is maintained in autonomic dysfunction has been debated for a long time, and the rather sparse data available are equivocal. The relationship between CBF and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was therefore tested in eight patients with symptoms and signs of severe cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction.
   patients and methods: Eight patients were included, three of whom had Parkinson's disease, three diabetes, one pure autonomic failure and the last one had multiple system atrophy. By the use of two techniques, the arteriovenous oxygen [(a-v)O-2] method and xenon-inhalation with single photon emission tomography, 15 measurements (range 10-20) and three to four CBF measurements, respectively, were obtained in each patient. Following CBF measurements during baseline, MABP was raised gradually using intravenous noradrenaline infusion, and then lowered by application of lower body negative pressure. From the (a-v)O-2 samples the CBF response to changes in MABP was evaluated using a computer program fitting one or two regression lines through the plot.
   Results and conclusion: Preserved autoregulation was observed in three patients, while the remaining five patients showed a linear relationship between CBF and MABP. Comparison of the results of the tomographic CBF measurements to the (a-v) O-2 data demonstrated that it is not possible to assess whether CBF is autoregulated or not with only three to four pairs of data.

TI Treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome in severe acute pancreatitis
   patients with traditional Chinese medicine
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB AIM: To investigate the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese traditional medicines Da Cheng Qi Decoction (Timely-Purging and Yin-Preserving Decoction) and Glauber's salt combined with conservative measures on abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients.
   METHODS: Eighty consecutive SAP patients, admitted for routine non-operative conservative treatment, were randomly divided into study group and control group (40 patients in each group). Patients in the study group received Da Cheng Qi Decoction enema for 2 h and external use of Glauber's salt, once a day for 7 d. Patients in the control group received normal saline (NS) enema. Routine non-operative conservative treatments included non-per os nutrition (NPON), gastrointestinal decompression, life support, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), continuous peripancreatic vascular pharmaceutical infusion and drug therapy. Intra-cystic pressure (ICP) of the two groups was measured during treatment. The effectiveness and outcomes of treatment were observed and APACHE II scores were applied in analysis.
   RESULTS: On days 4 and 5 of treatment, the ICP was lower in the study group than in the control group (P < 0.05). On days 3-5 of treatment, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores for the study and control groups were significantly different (P < 0.05). Both the effectiveness and outcome of the treatment with Da Cheng Qi Decoction on abdominalgia, burbulence relief time, ascites quantity, cyst formation rate and hospitalization time were quite different between the two groups (P < 0.05). The mortality rate for the two groups had no significant difference.
   CONCLUSION: Da Cheng Qi Decoction enema and external use of Glauber's salt combined with routine non-operative conservative treatment can decrease the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of SAP patients and have preventive and therapeutic effects on abdominal compartment syndrome of SAP.

TI Trace element intakes should be revisited in burn nutrition protocols: A
   cohort study
SO CLINICAL NUTRITION
AB Background & aims: Due to inflammatory and hypermetabolic responses and to extensive exudative trace element (TEs) losses, major burn patients have substantially increased nutritional requirements. To date, information is only available for Cu, Se, and Zn. We aimed at analyzing losses of 12 TEs and Mg through burn wound exudation and corresponding plasma concentrations during the first week after burn injury, and to evaluate the impact of current TE repletion protocols.
   Methods: Burn wound exudate was collected under negative pressure in 15 adult patients burned 29 +/- 20% of body surface (TBSA) for 8 days after injury. Two samples were collected daily. The TE concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Losses and serum concentrations were compared to intakes.
   Results: For the majority of 12 TEs, the highest losses were observed on day 1, and declined thereafter. Despite Cu supplementation (4.23 mg/day) serum levels remained below reference values. Se supplements (745 mu g/day) normalized and even increased serum levels to upper normal value. Despite large supplements (Zn 67.5 mg/day), serum Zn values remained below reference range. Large exudative losses of B, Br and Mg were found, as well as of Fe and I, with the latter being probably due to contamination.
   Conclusion: Current nutritional Cu, Se, Zn repletion protocols in major burn patients which were based on measured exudative losses should be revised to include higher Cu and lower Se doses, as well as planned Mg administration. In burns <20% TBSA and for the other TEs the recommended parenteral nutrition TE doses appear sufficient. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

TI Enhancing the osmotic energy conversion of a nanoporous membrane:
   influence of pore density, pH, and temperature
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Salinity gradient power, which converts Gibbs free energy of mixing to electric energy through an ion-selective pore, has great potential. Towards practical use, developing membrane-scaled nanoporous materials is desirable and necessary. Unfortunately, the presence of a significant ion concentration polarization (ICP) lowers appreciably the power harvested, especially at a high pore density. To alleviate this problem, we suggest applying an extra pressure difference Delta P across a membrane containing multiple nanopores, taking account of the associated power consumption. The results gathered reveal that the application of a negative pressure difference can improve the power harvested due to the enhanced selectivity. In addition, if the pore density of a membrane is high, raising its pore length is necessary to make the energy harvested economic. For example, if the pore length is 2000 nm and the pore density is 2.5 x 10(9) pores per cm(2), an increment in the power density of 213 mW m(-2) can be obtained by applying Delta P = -1 bar at pH 11 and 323 K, where a net positive power density can be retrieved. The performance of the system considered under various conditions is examined in detail, along with associated mechanisms.

TI Brain Hypoxia Secondary to Diffusion Limitation in Hypoxic Ischemic
   Brain Injury Postcardiac Arrest
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objectives:
   We sought to characterize 1) the difference in the diffusion gradient of cellular oxygen delivery and 2) the presence of diffusion limitation physiology in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury patients with brain hypoxia, as defined by parenchymal brain tissue oxygen tension less than 20 mm Hg versus normoxia (brain tissue oxygen tension > 20 mm Hg).
   Design:
   Post hoc subanalysis of a prospective study in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury patients dichotomized into those with brain hypoxia versus normoxia.
   Setting:
   Quaternary ICU.
   Patients:
   Fourteen adult hypoxic-ischemic brain injury patients after cardiac arrest.
   Interventions:
   Patients underwent monitoring with brain oxygen tension, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, mean arterial pressure, and jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation. Data were recorded in real time at 300Hz into the ICM+ monitoring software (Cambridge University Enterprises, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Simultaneous arterial and jugular venous bulb blood gas samples were recorded prospectively.
   Measurements and Main Results:
   Both the normoxia and hypoxia groups consisted of seven patients. In the normoxia group, the mean brain tissue oxygen tension, jugular venous bulb oxygen tension, and cerebral perfusion pressure were 29 mm Hg (sd, 9), 45 mm Hg (sd, 9), and 80 mm Hg (sd, 7), respectively. In the hypoxia group, the mean brain tissue oxygen tension, jugular venous bulb oxygen to brain tissue oxygen tension gradient, and cerebral perfusion pressure were 14 mm Hg (sd, 4), 53 mm Hg (sd, 8), and 72 mm Hg (sd, 6), respectively. There were significant differences in the jugular venous bulb oxygen tension-brain oxygen tension gradient (16 mm Hg [sd, 6] vs 39 mm Hg sd, 11]; p < 0.001) and in the relationship of jugular venous bulb oxygen tension-brain oxygen tension gradient to cerebral perfusion pressure (p = 0.004) when comparing normoxia to hypoxia. Each 1 mm Hg increase in cerebral perfusion pressure led to a decrease in the jugular venous bulb oxygen tension-brain oxygen tension gradient by 0.36 mm Hg (95% CI, -0.54 to 0.18; p < 0.001) in the normoxia group, but no such relation was demonstrable in the hypoxia group.
   Conclusions:
   In hypoxic-ischemic brain injury patients with brain hypoxia, there is an elevation in the jugular venous bulb oxygen tension-brain oxygen tension gradient, which is not modulated by changes in cerebral perfusion pressure.

TI Origin of Ti-rich rims in quartz phenocrysts from the Upper Bandelier
   Tuff and the Tunnel Spring Tuff, southwestern USA
SO CHEMICAL GEOLOGY
AB Four compositionally zoned, melt inclusion-bearing quartz phenocrysts from the Upper Bandelier Tuff, New Mexico and the Tunnel Spring Tuff, Utah were examined in detail by cathodoluminescence, laser-ablation ICP-MS, and titanium-in-quartz (TitaniQ) thermobarometry in order to reconstruct the conditions of quartz crystallization. Temperature and TiO2 activity (alpha TiO2) in the magma were estimated from melt inclusion compositions by means of zircon saturation thermometry and an experimentally calibrated TiO2 solubility model, whereas pressure was estimated with the most recent calibration of the TitaniQ thermobarometer on the host quartz next to the analyzed melt inclusions.
   All four investigated quartz phenocrysts display a low-luminescent, Ti-poor core overgrown by a high-luminescent, Ti-rich rim. Reconstructed P-T-alpha TiO2 conditions suggest that the rimward increase in the Ti content of the two quartz crystals from the Upper Bandelier Tuff is due to a combination of increasing temperature, increasing alpha TiO2 and decreasing pressure, with the temperature effect being dominant in one crystal and the alpha TiO2 effect being dominant in the other crystal. In the two crystals from the Tunnel Spring Tuff the rimward increase in Ti content is mostly due to increasing temperature, but in one of them a negative pressure change played an equally important role.
   This study demonstrates that in rapidly cooled, peraluminous or metaluminous rhyolites the crystallization conditions of quartz phenocrysts can be reconstructed at the scale of individual growth zones, which allows to investigate the origin and evolution of such magmas in great detail.

TI Anti-lysyl oxidase combined with a vacuum device induces penile
   lengthening by remodeling the tunica albuginea
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY
AB This study aimed to explore whether and how anti-lysyl oxidase (anti-LOX) combined with a vacuum device (VD) could promote penile lengthening and to evaluate the effect on erectile function. This study was performed on four groups of adult rats: control, anti-LOX, VD (negative pressure value of -300 mmHg), and anti-LOX + VD. Penile length was measured by a modified VD method and verified on exposed length data. Intracavernous pressure (ICP) and maximum ICP/mean arterial pressure (MAP) ratio were recorded to assess erectile function. For corpus cavernosum, LOX activity and concentrations of pyridinoline, desmosine, hydroxyproline, and elastin were analyzed; transmission electron microscope and Hart's elastin staining were performed to monitor microstructural changes. Anti-LOX and VD significantly lengthened the penis by 10.8% (3.75 mm) and 8.2% (2.48 mm) compared with the control group, respectively, while anti-LOX + VD achieved the longest penile size (40.58 +/- 0.40 mm) which was 17.4% longer than the control group (34.58 +/- 0.54 mm). After 1-week washout, no penile retraction was observed. Meanwhile, exposed penile length data confirmed that the penis in the anti-LOX + VD group was also significantly longer. Anti-LOX inhibited LOX activity to reduce pyridinoline level, which led the penile tunica albuginea remodeling. However, it had no effect on hydroxyproline, desmosine, and elastin levels. Moreover, anti-LOX had no impact on erectile function, which was determined by ICP and ICP/MAP ratio. These results suggest that anti-LOX elongates the penis by reducing pyridinoline, which induces tunica albuginea remodeling. This lengthening effect was more obvious when combined with a VD. All procedures had no impact on erectile function.

TI ACUTE EFFECTS OF CHANGING PLASMA OSMOLALITY AND COLLOID ONCOTIC PRESSURE
   ON THE FORMATION OF BRAIN EDEMA AFTER CRYOGENIC INJURY
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB The cerebral effects of alterations in plasma osmolality (Osm) and colloid oncotic pressure (COP) were examined in normocarbic, normothermic, pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbits that had been subjected to cryogenic brain injury. Monitored variables in all animals included mean arterial, right atrial, and intracranial pressures (MAP, CVP, and ICP), electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, and cerebral blood flow (CBF). When surgical preparation was complete, a left parietal lesion was produced  with liquid nitrogen. Group 1 (control, n = 8) animals subsequently received only maintenance fluids [lactated Ringer''s solution (LR)]. One hour after injury, 3 other groups of animals underwent 45 minutes of plasmapheresis, carried out by arterial phlebotomy (packed red cells returned), with separated plasma being replaced by one of three fluids given in amounts sufficient to maintain MAP and CCP at baseline values. The three fluids were 1) 6% hetastarch in hypo-osmotic LR [Group 2(Hypo-Osm), n = 6; COP = 21 mm Hg, Osm = 130 mOsm/kg]; 2) iso-osmotic LR [Group 3(Hypo-COP), n = 8; COP = 0; Osm = 305]; and 3) 6% hetastarch in iso-osmotic LR [Group 4 (Iso-Osm/COP), n=8; COP = 21, Osm = 310]. The animals were killed by exsanguination 25 minutes after completion of plasmapheresis. The brain was removed, the hemispheres separated, weighed, and sliced, and the specific gravities (SpGr) of the regional tissue determined. There were no differences in MAP, CVP, regional CBF, or EEG activity among the groups. In Group 2, osmolality decreased by 12.7 .+-. 2.9 mOsm/kg (mean .+-. SD, COP unchanged), while ICP increased to 22 .+-. 6 mm Hg (P < 0.001 vs. groups 1,3, and 4) and CBF decreased to 73% of that recorded prior to plasmapheresis. In Group 3, COP was reduced by 10.8 .+-. 2.2 mm Hg (Osm unchanged), while both COP and osmolality were unchanged in Group 4 ICP increased in these groups to 9 .+-. 3 and 13 .+-. 4 mm Hg, respectively compared with 14 .+-. 9 in Group 1. The lesion itself caused decreases in regional SpGr in all animals (as compared with the contralateral hemispheres). The only significant fluid-related difference, however, was associated with a reduction in osmolality-and only in tissues remote from the injury. Changes in COP had no detectable effects. These results indicate that in the acute phase of brain injury, reductions in COP do not play an important role in brain injury, reductions in COP do not play an important role in brain edema formation,  and that changes in osmolality alter water content only in relatively normal brain regions.

TI The Burden of Brain Hypoxia and Optimal Mean Arterial Pressure in
   Patients With Hypoxic Ischemic Brain Injury After Cardiac Arrest
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objectives: In patients at risk of hypoxic ischemic brain injury following cardiac arrest, we sought to: 1) characterize brain oxygenation and determine the prevalence of brain hypoxia, 2) characterize autoregulation using the pressure reactivity index and identify the optimal mean arterial pressure, and 3) assess the relationship between optimal mean arterial pressure and brain tissue oxygenation. Design: Prospective interventional study. Setting: Quaternary ICU. Patients: Adult patients with return of spontaneous circulation greater than 10 minutes and a postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale score under 9 within 72 hours of cardiac arrest. Interventions: All patients underwent multimodal neuromonitoring which included: 1) brain tissue oxygenation, 2) intracranial pressure, 3) jugular venous continuous oximetry, 4) regional saturation of oxygen using near-infrared spectroscopy, and 5) pressure reactivity index-based determination of optimal mean arterial pressure, lower and upper limit of autoregulation. We additionally collected mean arterial pressure, end-tidal CO2, and temperature. All data were captured at 300 Hz using ICM+ (Cambridge Enterprise, Cambridge, United Kingdom) brain monitoring software. Measurements and Main Results: Ten patients (7 males) were included with a median age 47 (range 20-71) and return to spontaneous circulation 22 minutes (12-36 min). The median duration of monitoring was 47 hours (15-88 hr), and median duration from cardiac arrest to inclusion was 15 hours (6-44 hr). The mean brain tissue oxygenation was 23 mm Hg (sd 8 mm Hg), and the mean percentage of time with a brain tissue oxygenation below 20 mm Hg was 38% (6-100%). The mean pressure reactivity index was 0.23 (0.27), and the percentage of time with a pressure reactivity index greater than 0.3 was 50% (12-91%). The mean optimal mean arterial pressure, lower and upper of autoregulation were 89 mm Hg (11), 82 mm Hg (8), and 96 mm Hg (9), respectively. There was marked between-patient variability in the relationship between mean arterial pressure and indices of brain oxygenation. As the patients' actual mean arterial pressure approached optimal mean arterial pressure, brain tissue oxygenation increased (p < 0.001). This positive relationship did not persist when the actual mean arterial pressure was above optimal mean arterial pressure. Conclusions: Episodes of brain hypoxia in hypoxic ischemic brain injury are frequent, and perfusion within proximity of optimal mean arterial pressure is associated with increased brain tissue oxygenation. Pressure reactivity index can yield optimal mean arterial pressure, lower and upper limit of autoregulation in patients following cardiac arrest.

TI Numerical investigation on interaction mechanisms between flow field and
   electromagnetic field for nonequilibrium inductively coupled plasma
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In this paper, the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) wind tunnel, which is widely used in the development of thermal protection system for reentry vehicle in the aerospace field, is studied. The distribution properties and the interaction mechanism of the flow field and electromagnetic field are investigated by numerically solving the multi-physics fields coupling among the flow field, electromagnetic field, thermodynamic field and turbulent field. In the numerical simulation, the thermochemical non-equilibrium plasma magneto-hydrodynamic model is used to accurately simulate the high-frequency discharge, Joule heating, energy conversion, and internal energy exchange of air ICP. Finally, the distribution of electron temperature, particle number density, Lorentz force, Joule heating rate, velocity, pressure and electric field strength of air plasma are obtained through the multi-physics field coupling calculation. The results show that the plasma flow is in a thermodynamic non-equilibrium state near the torch wall in the induction coil region and that the Lorentz force plays an important role in controlling the momentum transfer. A strong eddy flow occurs between the inlet and the second turn of the inductive coil. The eddy flow has a close relationship with the negative pressure gradient and the electromagnetic heating phenomenon in the induction coil region. The radial Lorentz force is always negative. This indicates that the free electrons are generated near the wall due to the fact that the skin effect are always subjected to a force making them move to the central axis of the ICP torch. The maximum value of the radial Lorentz force is 3.95 times higher than that of the axial Lorentz. This indicates that the momentum transfer is predominantly radial. The Joule heating effect of the air particles is also affected by the radial Lorentz force. The maximum value of E-I is 2.9 times larger than the real part of electric field, E-R. The positive E-I is generated by the free electrons inside the plasma. The number density of free electrons reaches a maximum value at a distance of 5.5 mm far from the inner wall surface of the torch below the second induction coil. 91% of N-2 are dissociated into atomic N near the central axis. The maximum electron and translational temperature simulated in this paper are 9921 K and 8507 K, respectively.

TI Influence of Ventilation Mode on Blood Oxygenation - Investigation with
   Polish Virtual Lungs and Italian Model of Circulation
SO BIOCYBERNETICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Positive alveolar (P(A)) and thoracic (P(T)) pressures during artificial ventilation disturb pulmonary circulation, and might influence arterial blood oxygenation (PaO(2)). Initial analysis of such influence of different artificial ventilation modes is the goal of this paper. Previously elaborated virtual respiratory system (IBIB PAS, Warsaw, Poland) and cardiovascular system model (ICP CNR, Rome, Italy) were connected with two files-buffers to work as one virtual cardio-pulmonary system. Dependence of PaO(2) on two methods (continuous inspiratory airflow (VCV) or pressure (PCV)), two ventilatory frequencies (fV = 15 or 7.5/min), and two values of the minute ventilation (Vmin = 6 or 8L/min) was investigated. Perfusion dependence on gravity was neglected as the virtual patient was in the supine position. Simulations showed that when fV = 15/min, neither the used method nor Vmin influence pulmonary blood flow significantly, whereas they influence the flow during expiration when fV = 7.5 (blood flow falls more for PCV and Vmin = 8 L/min). Vmin more significantly influences alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PO(2)) when fV = 15/min. PO(2) was greater for PCV As effects on the flow and PO(2) were contradictory, PaO(2) was almost independent of the used method and fV. It depended on Vmin more significantly if fV = 15/min.

TI Chronic administration of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor improves
   erectile and endothelial function in a rat model of diabetes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY
AB This study was conducted to determine if the long-term administration of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor, DA-8159, to diabetic rats can ameliorate the development of erectile dysfunction (ED) and endothelial dysfunction. After inducing diabetes with streptozotocin, DA-8159 was orally administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for 8 weeks. To examine the effect on erectile response, electrostimulation of the cavernous nerve with the parameters of 3 V, 5 ms, 5 Hz or 10 Hz, was performed to measure the intracavernous pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure ( MAP). Thoracic aorta relaxation in vitro was evaluated by adding acetycholine (Ach) cumulatively to the bathing medium. In addition, the plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels were measured in order to investigate the effect of DA-8159 on endothelial dysfunction. The area under the curve (AUC) from the ICP/MAP ratio in the 10 Hz stimulation showed a significantly increased AUC after the 10 mg/kg treatment compared with the diabetic group ( 8891 +/- 619 vs. 6316 +/- 1016, respectively, p < 0.05). At the 5 Hz frequency, DA-8159 10 mg/kg also induced a significant increase in the AUC compared with the diabetic control. The maximum ICP/MAP ratio (%) of the 10 mg/kg treatment group was significantly higher in both the 10 Hz and 5 Hz frequency groups ( p < 0.05). A treatment of 3 mg/kg tended to increase the AUC and peak ICP/MAP but was not statistically significant. The Ach EC50 value of the diabetic group was significantly higher than in the normal control (120.50 +/- 22.90 nM vs. 86.80 +/- 9.30 nM, respectively), and 10 mg/kg treatment group showed a significantly lower EC50 value (88.38 +/- 19.7 nM). The ET-1 level was lower in groups treated with DA- 8159, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg treatment induced a statistical difference compared with the diabetic control ( 1.15 +/- 0.34 fmol/mL vs. 2.51 +/- 0.55 fmol/mL, respectively, p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that chronic administration of DA-8159 could attenuate the development of the ED in diabetes and its effect is associated with an improvement in the endothelial function.

TI Cry analisys of deaf and normal hearing zero-to two-year old childrens
SO SALUD MENTAL
AB Infant crying is a complex phenomenon that implies several functions: breathing, action of laryngeal and supra-laryngeal muscles under the control of the neurovegetative systems of the brainstem, and the limbic system, and the association of cortical areas and the cerebellum. Although it is a communication system different to babbling and language, it is related with the future development of phonation. Cry analysis provides information about the neurophysiologic and psychological states of newborns and the identification of perinatal abnormalities. It is necessary to discuss the subject extensively because there are new data on situations such as laringomalacia, congenital hypothyroidism, deafness and sleep apnea that seem to be associated to infantile crying behaviors.
   Infant cries can be analyzed as behavioral conditions (hunger, anger and pain cries) allows knowing of mother-child relationship or the effect under diverse cultural conditions, such as stress, emotional deprivation or illness. A spectrographic analysis of the cries may identify several characteristics: threshold, latency, duration of phonation, maximum and minimum of the fundamental frequency (F0), occurrence and maximum pitch of shift, gliding, melody, biphonation, bifurcation, noise concentration, quality of the voice, double harmonic break, glottal plosives, vibratos, melody types, F0 stability and inspiratory stridor. To date, it has not been possible to establish alteration patterns. The best studied variables are F0, its harmonics and the duration of each emission; it is accepted that F0 varies between 400 and 600 Hz, during 1.4 +/- 0.6 s. Under such approaches, diverse alterations and risk factors have been studied: congenital alterations, malnutrition, sudden death, maternal exposition to drugs, prematurely born babies or perinatal asphyxia and disturbances of the central nervous system. Authors have reported F0 equal or less than 300 Hz in cases of sudden death or with high frequencies, near the 1000 Hz in the cri du chat syndrome, perinatal asphyxia and other cases who died suddenly During the cry. there is an increase of intra-abdominal pressure, heart rate and blood pressure, reduction of oxygen saturation, increase of the intra cranial-pressure, beginning of stress reactions, depletion of the energy anf oxygen reserves, such as the found in the Valsalva's maneuver. Every event of prolonged cries implies alteration of the breathing control like a Hering-Breuer reflex. Considering that some authors have proposed early vocalizations are a good predictor of deafness, in a previous paper we reported the characteristics of the cry of 20 deaf neonates. However, we were not able to demonstrate differences when comparing them with normal hearing neonates and infants, using only parametric methods. Still, we decided to go further and investigate the quality of infant cries of deaf neonates and infants.
   Material and methods. Twenty zero-to two-year old cases were studied; they were deaf children of both sexes; all cases were included in a follow-up program on the Human Communication Department of the National Institute of Perinatology of Mexico and were compared with 20 normal hearing children. We recorded Brain Stem Evoked Auditory, Responses (BEAR) and cry recording using a digital Sony recorder during the physical exploration. We analyzed the frequency (Hz) and duration of the espiratory cries, the duration of inspiration between two cry, emissions and the characteristics of the spectrogram.
   Quantitiative analysis. The usual estimates of means and standard variation were obtained and they, were compared with one way analysis of variance. We organized typologies of frequency by means of cluster techniques (Ward method). The distribution of the duration of the periods of crying and silence was explored with a contingency tables.
   Qualitative analysis. Two standardized observers visually analyzed all the cries to determine any variation of F0 and of harmonic frequencies. Whenever a variation of F0 was observed, we obtained maximum and minimum frequencies, as well as average duration of each cry emission. The procedure was validated by means of the graphic comparison with a Fourier's analysis.
   Results. Mean duration of cries in the deaf group was 03845 0.6150 s (range 0.08-5.2 s), while in the group of normal hearing cases was 0.5387 coproduct 0.2631 (range 0.06-1.75 s). From the deaf group, five cases had very prolonged duration of cries, without statistical significance. The mean duration of the inspiration was 0.3962 +/- 0.2326, with a range of 0.06 to 1.75 in the deaf group and of 0.4083 +/- 0.1854, with a range of 0.21 at 0.96, in the controls, without difference among groups. There was no correlation between the time of espiratory cry and that of the inspiration. Three cry topologies were organized: one of shorter duration (mean 0.30 s), with 111 spectrograms, an intermediate one (mean 0.73) with 85 spectrograms and one of prolonged duration (mean 4.5 s) with spectrograms of three cases. Three topologies of the inspiratory period were obtained: one of short periods (mean 0.33 s), with 171 spectrograms, one of intermediate duration (mean 0.80 s) with 18 spectrograms and one of prolonged duration (mean 1.60 s) with three cases. There were no statistical differences of tipologies between the deaf groups and normal hearing cases. On the qualitative analysis of cries, we came across several variations which are interpreted as abnormalities: vibratos, poor melodic control, loss of fundamental frequencies, harmonic limited production, plosives, gliding, bi phonation, and a loss of intensity at end of cry emissions. These changes were also observed on the control cases, but only in a very limited number.
   Discussion. Cry spectrogram analysis are non invasive indicators of the neonate's neurophysiologic organization. Although cry duration varies in healthy newborns, the accepted variation for a normal range is 1.1 to 2.8 s, with standard deviations around 0.6 s. Consistent differences have not been demonstrated between risk and control groups. However, abnormal cases such as Down syndrome or severe asphyxia have very short cries, whereas on the Cri du chat syndrome the duration of cries is prolonged. Extended cries imply cardiac and respiratory risks which have been associated with later outcomes as development retardation and Sudden death. There are also some questions to solve, such as the regulation and control of cry, starting from breathing mechanisms or from a sensorial afferent, mediated by hearing. The deaf infants are constituted in a study model, considering that the auditory, afference is suppressed and the control of the cry is restricted to the breathing environment.In the studied spectrograms, the duration of the cry was within reported normal limits by other authors, inasmuch in the normal hearing control cases as in the deaf, except the dissident cases, but without these reaching statistical significance. Further research of brainstem function is needed for the abnormal cases with prolonged cry periods, since such cries are interpreted as an alteration of the breathing reflexes of Hering-Breuer, which might have a pathological meaning in the sense of the sob's spasm or even more severe risk factors as sleep apnea and even sudden death.
   The qualitative analysis in the deaf individuals demonstrated a poor quality and unstable character of melodic control, with a smaller number of harmonics. The deaf cases lost the relationship between the fundamental frequencies and their harmonics, mainly because of the participation of supraglottic structures that modulate pitch and due to the poorness of melodic control, either for monotony or due to the impossibility of returning to a normal pattern, following variations such as vibrato, plosives or noise concentration. In the cases of prolonged cries, starting from the third second, the sound intensity tends to diminish and the harmonics are lost, perhaps due to a decrease of the subglottal pressure of phonation. This finding supports the auditory control of crying related to breathing mechanisms.
   Conclusions. In preliminary terms, by means of the melodic analysis of the spectrograms, differences are demonstrated between the cries of the deaf and of the normal hearing cases. The increase of the complexity of the melody of the cry, or their poverty,, are indicative of the neuromuscular function and they may support the evaluation of phonation before language development. The study of the spectrograms of deaf individuals does not constitute an element for the detection or for diagnosis since, to date, estimators of sensibility or of specificity have not been established, but they constitute a support for its integral evaluation, with the possibility of evaluating and of improving therapeutic rehabilitation.
