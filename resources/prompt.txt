Lets make a project in next.js. I have an idea of how we should implement it, but feel free to improve it if i have missed anything or we could improve it in another way.

Project: Systematic Review Assistant (Next.js + GPT)
Goal: Build a web-based tool that helps researchers screen large numbers of articles (from systematic review searches) using AI to assist inclusion/exclusion decisions.

Key Features:
1) File Upload
- Upload .txt file of articles (e.g., embase.txt), here is an example of how one article will look like in the txt file  
- Upload a .txt file with inclusion criteria

2) Article Parsing
- Parse article entries from the file (<1>, <2>, etc.)
- Extract Title and Abstract for each

3) AI Evaluation (GPT-3.5)
- Use OpenAI GPT-3.5 to assess each article against the inclusion criteria
- AI returns a “Yes” or “No” + explanation

4) User Review
- Display AI results in a list/table
- Let user accept or override each AI suggestion

5) Store User Decisions
- Save results (article, AI decision, user response) to Supabase

Tech Stack:
Frontend	- Next.js (App Router)
Styling & Components - ShadCN + Tailwind CSS
AI - OpenAI GPT-3.5
Hosting - Vercel
Database & Auth - Supabase
File Storage (optional) - Supabase Storage or local FS
Cost Management - GPT-3.5 batching & estimator

Prompt Format example: 
"You are assisting with a systematic review.

Inclusion criteria:
[...from criteria.txt...]

Evaluate this article:
Title: ...
Abstract: ...

Does this article meet the inclusion criteria? Answer "Yes" or "No" and explain briefly."

API Keys / Env:
- OPENAI_API_KEY (for GPT access)
- SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (for DB access)
