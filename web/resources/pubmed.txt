Abstract
  Intracranial hypertension due to central venous stenosis (CVS) is an under-recognized but potentially morbid complication of central venous catheters that can have a benign course if recognized and treated early. Here we report a case of a 23-year-old woman requiring hemodialysis via right subclavian catheter who presented with an intracranial hypertension syndrome and sudden visual loss secondary to right innominate vein thrombosis that improved after angioplasty treatment. This case illustrates how CVS can alter the pressure gradient between the subarachnoid space and the cerebral venous sinuses by increasing venous pressure, affecting cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Since CVS is a common finding in patients receiving hemodialysis, intracranial hypertension due to central venous stenosis is a differential diagnosis to consider in patients of this type who present with intracranial hypertension syndrome.

Abstract
  Background: Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) is an alternate mode of ventilation in acute respiratory failure (ARF), but there is inconsistent data to support its use over other modes of ventilation. Because of increased intrathoracic pressure for most of the respiratory cycle, a negative impact of APRV on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) has been hypothesized. We evaluated the effects of APRV ventilation, with particular attention to ICP, CPP and ICP-directed therapy, in a real-world cohort of neuro-ICU patients. Methods: Retrospective single-center analysis from January 2021 to December 2023 of neurosurgical ICU patients with ICP monitoring. APRV was used as a rescue mode at the physician's discretion when the Horovitz index (PaO2/FIO2 ratio) fell below 150 despite optimized conventional ventilation. Results: Between 2021 and 2023, APRV was utilized in 29 patients undergoing a total of 60 episodes. Forty patients (66.7%) were female, median age was 49.5 (Q1 34; Q3 61.25) years.After transition to APRV, mean FiO2 decreased by 4.3% (t = 3.5, p < .001) and mean PaO2 increased by 22.7 mm Hg (t = 4.2, p < .001). The Horovitz index improved by 44.6 mm Hg (t = 4.9, p < .001). Mean compliance did not differ after transition to APRV (-1.5 ml/mbar, t = -0.9, p = .4). During the APRV episode, mean ICP was 1.2 mm Hg lower (t = 2.6, p = .01), while mean CPP was 1.6 mm Hg higher (t = -0.9, p = .4) and the intensity of ICP-directed therapy (TIL) was significantly lower (X2 = 92.771, p < .001). Conclusion:  APRV was hemodynamically tolerated in 29 out of 33 patients, and was safe with regard to ICP, CPP, and the intensity of ICP-directed therapy. Oxygenation was increased by APRV. 4 out of 33 patients would not tolerate APRV for hemodynamic reasons, APRV therefore was stopped immediately.

Abstract
  Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, also known as progeria, is a rare genetic disorder that causes premature and accelerated ageing from the neonatal period. The disease is caused by de novo mutations in the LMNA gene. Patients present with a range of symptoms, including skin, bone, joint and cardiac disorders, as well as characteristic facial dysmorphia. Intracranial hypertension is not a known symptom of this disease. To the best of our knowledge, no case of a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome presenting with intracranial hypertension without a traumatic context has been reported in the literature to date. This report presents the case of a child diagnosed with Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome who presented with intracranial hypertension at the age of three years, with no secondary cause identified. Long-term treatment with acetazolamide was required to control the intracranial hypertension. We hypothesise that the intracranial hypertension may be related to vascular abnormalities observed in Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, which may cause a venous drainage dysfunction. To support the hypothesis of a non-random association between intracranial hypertension and Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, further reports of similar cases in children with the syndrome are required.

Abstract
  Applying mechanical ventilation and selecting ventilatory strategies in patients with acute brain injuries, especially those with lung damage, is challenging. Static (positive-end-expiratory-pressure) and dynamic (intra-tidal) changes in ventilator pressure, via complex pathways, influence cerebral arterial inflow and cerebral venous pressure and thus, cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure. In this process, the relationship between airway pressure and pleural and trans-alveolar pressures, heavily affected by elastance of chest wall and lung, respectively, plays a central role. This relationship determines the extent to which a static and dynamic increase in airway pressure affect the cardiac function and venous return curves, which govern the static and dynamic arterial and central venous pressures. The integrity of cerebral autoregulation determines whether static changes in arterial pressure alter cerebral arterial inflow. Conversely, dynamic changes in arterial pressure during the breath are followed by corresponding changes in cerebral arterial inflow, due to inability of autoregulation to control rapid arterial pressure fluctuations. The flow dynamics in the jugular veins and the relationship between intracranial and sagittal sinus pressures determine whether static and dynamic changes in central venous pressure alter cerebral venous pressure. Setting the ventilator and planning strategies should be individualized and guided by the complex, interactive effects among central nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular systems on cerebral blood volume and cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressures. Following a logical framework, the clinician may anticipate the likely effects of ventilator settings and strategies on cerebral hemodynamics, enabling a more individualized approach in setting the ventilator and planning ventilatory strategies.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous pressures, sinus trans-stenosis gradients, and intracranial pressures are thought to be influenced by head position.

   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the intracranial manifestations of these changes in patients with cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVD).

   METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 22 consecutive adult patients who underwent diagnostic cerebral venography with rotational internal jugular vein (IJV) venography and superior sagittal sinus (SSS) pressure measurements in multiple head positions. Data on venous sinus pressures, IJV pressures, and lumbar puncture (LP) opening pressures (OP) were collected and analyzed.

   RESULTS: The study found that 21 (96%) patients experienced increases in SSS pressures with head rotation, with a mean increase of 25.4%. Intracranial trans-stenosis gradients showed significant variability with head position. Additionally, LP OP measurements increased by an average of 44.3% with head rotation. Dynamic IJV stenosis was observed in all patients during rotational testing.

   CONCLUSION: Head position significantly affects cerebral venous pressures, trans-stenosis gradients, and intracranial pressures in patients with CVD or intracranial hypertension. These findings highlight the need for dynamic venography in the diagnostic evaluation of these conditions to better understand their pathophysiology and improve treatment strategies.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a cerebrovascular disease with increased intracranial pressure from impaired cerebral venous drainage and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid. There is a lack of evidence to prove the benefits and risks of thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapies. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the therapeutic effect of carotid artery puncture injections of urokinase combined with warfarin in patients with CVST.

   METHODS: Thirty-six patients with CVST who received a carotid artery puncture injection of urokinase combined with warfarin were retrospectively analyzed in the urokinase group, while 30 patients with CVST received subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and warfarin, as the control group. Clinical parameters, imaging data, laboratory test data, treatment plans, and follow-up information were collected and compared.

   RESULTS: At discharge, the GCS score was higher in the urokinase group than that in the control group. In the urokinase group, no patient died. Recanalization of the venous sinus trunk was observed in 32 patients. While two patients died in the control group, recanalization of the venous sinus trunk was achieved in 20 patients. A follow-up examination showed that recovery in the urokinase group was also better than that in the control group.

   CONCLUSION: This study suggests that carotid artery puncture injection of urokinase combined with warfarin is a safe and effective option for CVST, can reduce CVST recurrence. However, this was a retrospective study with a relatively small sample size, and future studies are needed to confirm the procedure's feasibility.

Abstract
  Background: Endovascular treatment of dural venous sinus stenosis using auto-expandable stents is progressively becoming a central part in the management of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and pulsatile tinnitus. One potential concern during stenting is impairment of venous outflow in the Labbe vein, which usually drains in close proximity to the culprit transverse sinus stenosis. Methods: We propose a technique which can counteract venous outflow impairment, consisting of temporary balloon protection of the Labbe vein during stent deployment. Results: We illustrate the use of this technique in a case of IIH with intrinsic dural sinus stenosis induced by a large arachnoid granulation situated close to the insertion of the Labbe vein. The stent was deployed under temporary balloon inflation in order to deflect the arachnoid granulation away from the vein ostium. Conclusions: In selected cases of intrinsic stenosis, temporary balloon protection can be used to avoid Labbe vein flow impairment during venous sinus stenting.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous sinus stenting (CVSS) is an effective treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) secondary to dural venous sinus stenosis. Traditional selection of patients for CVSS has been made by microcatheter manometry, but pressure measurements are often equivocal. Here we present the results of a series of cases in which venous flat-panel CT (FP-CT) was used as an adjunct to microcatheter manometry to improve decision making and precise stent placement during CVSS.

   METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with IIH underwent angiography with microcatheter manometry and venous FP-CT, with CVSS if indicated by the results. Cross-sectional measurements of the narrowed sinus were obtained on FP-CT before and after stenting. After the procedure, clinical outcomes were tracked. Follow-up with quantitative MRA with sinus flow measurements was also performed, when available.

   RESULTS: There was an exponential correlation between measured pressure gradient and degree of stenosis calculated using venous FP-CT. All patients with both a high degree of stenosis measured by FP-CT and a high pressure gradient across the stenosis showed a clinical benefit from stenting.

   CONCLUSIONS: True measurement of the cross-sectional area of the dural sinus, made by venous phase FP-CT, has a high degree of correlation with elevated venous pressure gradient across the point of stenosis. Even in a limited series of cases, we found an exponential decrease in flow with increasing severity of stenosis. Furthermore, patients with both an elevated venous pressure gradient and critical stenosis of the sinus on FP-CT showed symptomatic improvement after stenting.

Abstract
  In spite of expanding research, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and its spectrum conditions remain challenging to treat. The failure to develop effective treatment strategies is largely due to poor agreement on a coherent disease pathogenesis model. Herein we provide a hypothesis of a unifying model centered around the internal jugular veins (IJV) to explain the development of IIH, which contends the following: (1) the IJV are prone to both physiological and pathological compression throughout their course, including compression near C1 and the styloid process, dynamic muscular/carotid compression from C3 to C6, and lymphatic compression; (2) severe dynamic IJV stenosis with developments of large cervical gradients is common in IIH-spectrum patients and significantly impacts intracranial venous and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures; (3) pre-existing IJV stenosis may be exacerbated by infectious/inflammatory etiologies that induce retromandibular cervical lymphatic hypertrophy; (4) extra-jugular venous collaterals dilate with chronic use but are insufficient resulting in impaired aggregate cerebral venous outflow; (5) poor IJV outflow initiates, or in conjunction with other factors, contributes to intracranial venous hypertension and congestion leading to higher CSF pressures and intracranial pressure (ICP); (6) glymphatic congestion occurs but is insufficient to compensate and this pathway becomes overwhelmed; and (7) elevated intracranial CSF pressures triggers extramural venous sinus stenosis in susceptible individuals that amplifies ICP elevation producing severe clinical manifestations. Future studies must focus on establishing norms for dynamic cerebral venous outflow and IJV physiology in the absence of disease so that we may better understand and define the diseased state.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Tumors that invade or compress the venous sinuses have the potential to impair venous drainage. Rarely, this may be so severe as to induce intracranial hypertension. Other studies have previously described venous sinus stenting (VSS) for the treatment of these symptomatic lesions. In this report, we present our series of eight cases of VSS for symptomatic tumor-induced venous sinus stenosis and review the existing literature.

   CASES: Eight patients with mostly intracranial tumors were found to have symptomatic venous sinus stenosis with the most common presenting symptom being elevated intracranial pressure. Six of the eight (75%) patients presented with papilledema on neuro-ophthalmological exam. The most affected locations were the transverse and sigmoid sinuses in four patients, followed by the superior sagittal sinus in three patients. All eight patients underwent VSS with no adverse events. In total, 6 out of 8 (75%) of patients had complete resolution of their symptoms, while the remaining patients experienced at least partial improvement.

   CONCLUSION: Tumors that cause symptomatic venous sinus stenosis may be successfully managed with VSS to improve venous drainage. This may facilitate continued conservative management of meningiomas or allow for treatment with noninvasive means, such as stereotactic radiosurgery. Depending on the size of the target stenosis, balloon-mounted coronary stents may be a suitable option to treat these lesions.

Abstract
  Venous sinus stenting for dural venous sinus outflow obstruction due to an intrinsic filling obstruction or extrinsic stenosis is an increasingly popular treatment strategy for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and isolated pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The most common site of stenosis is the lateral venous sinus at the transverse-sigmoid junction. Approximately 10% of the population has a persistent occipital venous sinus (OVS), a variant that may be the dominant venous drainage pathway in the setting of a hypoplastic or aplastic transverse sinus. OVS stenosis has been rarely associated with IIH and isolated PT with only a handful published cases. We herein report a retrospective series of OVS stenting in five patients, four of whom presented with non-IIH PT and one with IIH.

Abstract
  Stenting of the dural venous sinuses has emerged as a therapeutic option for intracranial hypertension and pulsatile tinnitus. However, venous endovascular navigation faces challenges due to lower-quality roadmaps compared to arterial navigation. This study explores the application of three-dimensional (3D) rotational venography in assessing the cerebral venous vasculature and its potential for venous navigation. The methods involve venous 3D digital subtracted angiography (DSA) in patients with dural venous stenosis, with image acquisition using a biplane angiographic system. The results highlight the enhanced spatial resolution of 3D venous imaging, providing anatomical information crucial for precise characterization of stenosis and understanding cortical venous drainage. 3D venous roadmapping is shown to improve endovascular venous navigation, offering synchronized and rotatable 3D roadmaps, providing a comprehensive approach to optimize endovascular venous interventions.

Abstract
  Patients will frequently present with "a watery eye" or "a tearing eye." Historically, this was called epiphora, but there have been recent variations in the use of different terms. Lacrimation (or lachrymation) is derived from "lacrima," Latin for tear, and essentially means "production of tears," although it is often used to describe the "shedding of tears" or to cry. Lacrimation may be basal (basic tear production), reflexive (to stimuli such as surface irritation, glare, corneal ulcer, corneal exposure), and psychic (emotional). It is thought that animals do not exhibit emotional lacrimation, although recent observations of elephant mothers responding to their dead offspring have reignited this debate. The sympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland is thought to stimulate basal tear secretion. Basal tear production decreases with age, resulting in progressive acinar atrophy, fibrosis, and lymphocytic infiltrates. Normal basal tear production is 2 microliters per minute (10 ounces per day). It may be stated that lacrimation, whether used to imply the "production of tears" or tearing from emotion or stimuli, implies the production of tears in a normal person without and blockage of the excretory system. Epiphora English texts from at least 1475 have used epiphora to mean tearing or excessive tearing. It essentially means an abnormal overflow of tears from the eye onto the face. The cause is not specified. Lately, there has been a tendency to apply the word epiphora only to tearing caused by an obstruction. This does not have any historical accuracy, and the temptation to use it in this manner should be resisted. The word derives from ancient Greek epifora: "epi" means "on," "upon," or "in addition," and "pherein," meaning "bring" or "carry." The literal meaning of the word epiphora is "to bring upon." This symptom is known to have been described in Egypt (1500 BC) and by Hippocrates (460 BC to 370 BC). Epiphora applies to excessive tearing caused by excessive tear production or secondary to poor drainage. Epiphora is sometimes subdivided into: Gustatory epiphora ("crocodile tears" caused by aberrant nerve regeneration). Reflex epiphora (reactive tear production caused by any ocular surface trauma or stimulation). Obstructive epiphora (punctal, canalicular, lacrimal sac, or lacrimal duct occlusion). Hypersecretory epiphora is the production of excessive tears. This is very rare. Plerolacrima Patients often present with the complaint that they have "a pool of tears in the eyes that interferes with vision," but not frank epiphora. This is also sometimes seen in patients after a dacryocystorhinostomy, where the tear flow may be improved, but the obstruction is not completely corrected. Ian Francis, a classically trained and thinking surgeon, coined the term "plerolacrima" in 2002. He derived it from the Greek "plero" (meaning full) and the Latin "lacrima" (tears). He noted that it was a similar derivative to the one H. M. Traquair of Edinburgh coined in 1927: "plerocephalic edema" to indicate optic nerve edema caused by raised intracranial pressure. We feel this is a useful term that completes the types of excessive tearing or pooling of tears that bother patients and is deserving of an addition to our medical lexicon. Symptoms: Epiphora can cause blurry vision, discharge if there is a lacrimal sac infection, mucoid discharge if there is a canalicular foreign body, eyelid skin excoriation from constant wiping and laxity of the lower eyelids from constant wiping The tear film is comprised of three layers: an innermost mucin layer produced by goblet cells of the conjunctiva, which are found mostly in the fornices; an aqueous layer produced by the lacrimal glands and a minor portion from the accessory lacrimal glands of Wolfring and Krause. an outermost lipid layer produced by the meibomian glands and Zeis and Moll glands (found on the eyelid margin). The mucin layer creates a wettable surface on the cornea. The aqueous layer provides a smooth surface and hydration. The lipid layer reduces surface tension and increases tear break-up time. Tears are secreted at a basal rate as well as reflexively in response to stimuli. Dysfunction of any of these components contributes to surface disease and abnormal tearing, resulting in discomfort, altered light refraction, and blurred vision. The lacrimal system has secretory and excretory components. Normally, there is a balance between tear production and drainage. When this balance is affected, either the secretory or the excretory component may produce epiphora. The secretory lacrimal system produces tears. The main lacrimal gland is located in the lacrimal fossa of the frontal bone, divided into orbital and palpebral lobes by the lateral horn of the levator aponeurosis. Accessory lacrimal glands are located in the fornices and eyelids. The trigeminal nerve, the facial nerve, sympathetic innervation, and parasympathetic innervation stimulate tear production from the lacrimal glands. The Secretory System is composed of (fig 1):  1. The Main Lacrimal Gland:  The orbital lobe. The palpebral lobe. 2. Accessory Lacrimal Glands:  Glands of Krause. Glands of Wolfring. 3. Mucin Secretors :  Goblet cells. Glands of Manz. Crypts of Henle. 4. Oil Secretors:  Meibomian glands. Glands of Moll. Glands of Zeis. The anatomical excretory lacrimal system drains tears. Tears drain from the ocular surface via puncta in the lower and upper eyelids, into the ampulla, and then through the canaliculi. In 90% of people, the upper and lower canaliculi join to form a common canaliculus. The canaliculi drain into the lacrimal sac, followed by the nasolacrimal duct, which opens in the inferior meatus of the nose. Blockage can occur within any of these components. Both positive and negative pressure systems have been proposed as mechanisms of tear flow through the excretory lacrimal system. The anatomical excretory system (the punctum, the canaliculus, and the common canalicular opening are termed the upper lacrimal system, and the lacrimal sac and the nasolacrimal duct are termed the lower lacrimal system) is composed of (figs 2, 3): 1. The puncta. 2. The canaliculus: Vertical component 2 mm upper and 2 mm lower. Horizontal component 8 mm upper and 10 mm lower. Common canalicular opening into the lacrimal sac. 3. Lacrimal sac: 12 to 15 mm vertical height. 4 to 8 mm anteroposteriorly. 3 to 5 mm in width. One-third of the lacrimal sac is above the medial canthal tendon. 4. Nasolacrimal duct: Measures 12 to 18 mm . The nasolacrimal duct angulates 15% posteriorly and 15 to 30 degrees laterally. 5. Valves and sinuses: Valve of Bochdalek. Valve of Folz. Sinus of Maier. Valve of Rosenmuller is the angulation of the common canaliculus as it enters the lacrimal sac. Valve of Krause. Valve of Hyrtl. Valve of Hasner is the most important valve as an imperforate membrane here causes congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Lacrimal sac and duct diverticula. Functional Excretory System As one blinks, the orbicularis oculi muscle contracts: the pretarsal and preseptal orbicularis muscles each have a deep medial head. The contracture causes dilatation of the lacrimal sac and a suctioning effect. The lower eyelid rides upwards, and the punctum moves inwards. Tears are drawn into the punctum, canaliculus, and lacrimal sac by this pump mechanism. This pump mechanism is disturbed in the presence of facial nerve palsy.

Abstract
  Intracranial hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated pressure within the skull. The increase in pressure can exert significant stress on the brain and other intracranial structures, potentially leading to a range of neurological symptoms and complications. Intracranial hypertension's clinical manifestations vary depending on the underlying cause, severity of pressure elevation, and individual patient factors. Common symptoms may include severe headaches, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, and, in severe cases, seizures or coma. Diagnosing intracranial hypertension typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, results of neuroimaging studies like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement via invasive or noninvasive techniques. Early recognition and prompt management of this condition are essential to prevent potential complications, including permanent neurological damage and even death. Managing ICH typically involves addressing the underlying cause, optimizing cerebral perfusion, and sometimes surgical interventions to relieve pressure on the brain. Cerebrospinal Fluid and Intracranial Pressure The human skull has a fixed volume of approximately 1400 to 1700 mL. Intracranial content volume comprises 80% brain parenchyma, 10% cerebrospinal fluid, and 10% blood. The choroid plexus is the main CSF producer and regulator, secreting around 20 mL per hour, averaging 450 mL per day. Arachnoid granulations reabsorb CSF and drain it into the venous system at similar rates. Normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production varies by age, with typically high production during infancy that declines and stabilizes in childhood and adulthood. CSF pressures greater than 250 mm H20 in adults and 200 mm H20 in children generally signify increased ICP. Intracranial volume is more or less constant once the sutures completely ossify. Intracranial tissue or fluid volume elevation can raise intracranial pressure, which can occur in the presence of intracranial masses, ventricular stenosis, and hematomas. A large part of treating intracranial hypertension involves mitigating the risk of increased ICP and making timely clinical decisions to prevent adverse consequences.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Chiari I malformation results from a mismatch between the posterior fossa bones and neural components. Management usually relies on surgical treatment. Despite being the most common assumed positioning, the prone position can be challenging in high body mass index (BMI) patients (>40 kg/m2).

   METHODS: Between February 2020 and September 2021, 4 consecutive patients with class III obesity underwent posterior fossa decompression. The authors describe nuances of the positioning and perioperative details.

   RESULTS: No perioperative complications were reported. These patients are at a lower risk of bleeding and increased intracranial pressure as a consequence of low intra-abdominal pressure and venous return. In this context, the semi-sitting position, with the aid of accurate monitoring for venous air embolism, seems to be an advantageous surgical position in this group of patients.

   CONCLUSIONS: We present our results and technical nuances on positioning high BMI patients for posterior fossa decompression using a semi-sitting position. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is one of the most common causes of papilloedema seen by ophthalmologists and neurologists. Patients with IIH routinely undergo lumbar puncture (LP) for diagnosis. Dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST) is a rare complication of cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSF)-lowering procedures such as lumbar puncture and epidural and may be an intracranial complication of IIH.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 29-year-old obese woman was diagnosed with severe idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) after she presented with new-onset headache, pulsatile tinnitus and blurred vision. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and venography (MRV) were normal apart from signs of intracranial hypertension. Lumbar puncture (LP) revealed an opening pressure of 40 cm of water. Due to the severity of the papilloedema and vision loss, she was referred for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and found to have venous sinus thrombosis involving the superior sagittal sinus on the pre-operative computed tomography (CT) head 5 days after the LP. CT venography (CTV) one day later and MRV 3 days later showed significant worsening as the thrombosis extended into the deep venous system. She was started on therapeutic heparin and her symptoms and vision improved and she did not develop any neurological complications.

   CONCLUSIONS: DVST should be considered in IIH patients who have worsening papilloedema or symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Repeat venous imaging can prevent devastating consequences such as venous infarcts of haemorrhage in these patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Venous sinus injury resulting in thrombosis is a possible complication of skull base surgery and neck dissection. Although usually asymptomatic, sinus thrombosis can obstruct the dominant cranial venous outflow pathways, leading to a cycle of increased intracranial pressure secondary to venous congestion, which further compresses the remaining sinuses in a positive feedback loop. This can present with symptoms resembling idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

   OBSERVATIONS: A patient underwent a left mastoidectomy for chronic mastoiditis, complicated by injury of the ipsilateral dominant sigmoid sinus, with subsequent thrombosis. The patient developed chronic severe headaches, papilledema, visual blurring, and tinnitus. Angiography revealed a contralateral arachnoid granulation causing stenosis of the remaining venous outflow tract with a pressure gradient of 18 mm Hg. Transverse sinus stenting led to normalization of the gradient and resolution of symptoms.

   LESSONS: Injury of a dominant cranial venous outflow pathway led to a feedback loop that caused increased intracranial pressures and worsening contralateral transverse sinus stenosis, which was successfully treated using transverse sinus stenting. Venous congestive physiology leading to intracranial hypertension is underrecognized as a complication of venous injury in skull base surgery and responds to stenting if the patient's symptoms are refractory to conservative management or anticoagulation. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24781.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when blood clots form in the venous sinuses of the brain, leading to impaired venous drainage, increased intracranial pressure, and neurological deficits. We discuss the case of a 32-year-old female who presented with a four-day history of worsening headache, nausea, vomiting, and right-sided weakness. She was on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for two years for menstrual regulation. Neuroimaging, including non-contrast CT, CT venography, and MRI with MR venography, confirmed the diagnosis of CVT involving the superior sagittal sinus and right transverse sinus, with evidence of venous infarction. Laboratory investigations showed elevated D-dimer, but thrombophilia testing was negative. The patient was immediately started on anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), later transitioned to warfarin, and received supportive care. Symptoms improved significantly within days, and follow-up imaging at three months showed partial recanalization. The patient was advised to discontinue OCPs permanently and provided counseling on alternative contraceptive methods. This report emphasizes the importance of early recognition, timely neuroimaging, and appropriate anticoagulation in the management of OCP-associated CVT. Long-term follow-up is crucial to monitor for recanalization and to reduce the risk of recurrence. Copyright © 2025, Amri et al.

Abstract
  Pneumocephalus, commonly seen after trauma, surgical intervention, or meningitis, is rarely associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) procedures. We present a unique case of tension pneumocephalus in a 26-year-old female who experienced two distinct episodes of pneumocephalus. She presented with right-sided facial numbness, hearing loss, blurry vision, and gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large extra-axial lesion at the right petrous apex extending to the middle cranial fossa. The patient underwent an extended endoscopic endonasal approach for tumor resection, and the pathological diagnosis revealed an epidermoid cyst. Postoperatively, she improved. However, she developed abducens nerve palsy followed by extensive pneumocephalus with intraventricular extension, necessitating skull base defect repair. Six weeks later, she presented with acute hydrocephalus secondary to meningitis from Klebsiella pneumoniae, confirmed by positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures. She was treated with external ventricular drainage and antibiotic therapy, after which a VPS was inserted. Three days post-shunt insertion, the patient developed left-sided hemiparesis and swallowing dysfunction due to localized pneumocephalus within the tumor cavity compressing the brainstem. Following additional surgical intervention, her hemiparesis and other symptoms resolved. This case highlights the potential for tension pneumocephalus following ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion for hydrocephalus. The siphon effects of CSF shunting can cause excessively negative intracranial pressure. Combined with a postoperative skull base defect, this can lead to air ingress through the defect (ball valve mechanism), causing pneumocephalus. Copyright © 2025, Alalawi et al.

Abstract
  The sphenoid wing dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are clinically rare. They often present as non-sinus-type arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and may be associated with focal neurological deficits, intracranial venous hypertension, and intracranial hemorrhage. These cases are classified as lesser or greater sphenoid wing lesions. We searched the PubMed databases for studies evaluating the clinical presentation, surgical treatment, and endovascular treatment of these lesions and analyzed 37 cases from 22 papers. A total of 17 cases had lesser sphenoid wing AVFs, and the localization of the shunts could be divided into the sinus of the lesser sphenoid wing (SLSW) or the superficial middle cerebral vein (SMCV). Most SLSW AVFs drained into the cavernous sinus, but two cases drained directly into the deep middle cerebral vein via a bridging vein. All cases with shunts directly into the SMCV had reflux into the SMCV with varices. A total of 20 cases had shunts in the greater sphenoid wing, and the localization of the shunts varied, with shunt localization, and venous return morphology dependent on variations in middle fossa venous return. Most cases had shunts in the sphenobasal vein near the foramen ovale. However, some cases had shunts in the superior ophthalmic vein, sphenopetrosal vein, and laterocavernous sinus. Many were associated with cortical venous reflux. These lesions have been treated by surgical ligation of the drainage vein and transarterial or transvenous embolization. Recently, embolization has become the standard treatment for DAVFs due to advances in endovascular techniques. This paper reviewed and discussed the angioarchitecture, clinical presentation, and treatment of these lesions to clarify the characteristics of sphenoid wing DAVFs.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare cerebrovascular condition that causes obstruction of venous blood flow or cerebrospinal fluid circulation, leading to intracranial hypertension symptoms such as syncope and vomiting. Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) syndrome, a complication of hysteroscopic surgery, can also present with cerebral edema and symptoms similar to CVST, making differentiation challenging. Cases of unexplained recurrent syncope posthysteroscopy diagnosed as CVST have not been previously reported. We present a case of a 33-year-old woman who underwent hysteroscopy for abnormal uterine bleeding. Five hours postoperation, she experienced syncope, which resolved spontaneously. Ten hours later, she had recurrent syncope, nausea, and vomiting. Head computed tomography suggested cerebral edema, potentially indicating TURP syndrome. However, the brief surgery and minimal fluid imbalance (200 mL) made TURP syndrome unlikely. Further investigation with cranial magnetic resonance venography revealed multiple venous sinus thromboses, explaining the recurrent syncope linked to minimal fluid volume expansion postsurgery. Subsequent screening identified hyperhomocysteinemia as a contributing factor. Treatment with anticoagulants, folic acid, and vitamin B6 led to a favorable outcome. This case involves recurrent syncope after hysteroscopy secondary to CVST. If symptoms such as recurrent syncope, nausea, and vomiting, indicating increased intracranial pressure, arise posthysteroscopy and cannot be attributed to typical TURP syndrome, primary intracranial vascular conditions like CVST should be considered, as even a minor increase in blood volume can exacerbate these intracranial pressure symptoms.

Abstract
  Low- or very-low-pressure hydrocephalus is a serious and rare phenomenon, which is becoming better known since it was first described in 1994 by Pang and Altschuler. Forced drainage at negative pressures can, in most cases, restore the ventricles to their original size, thus achieving neurological recovery. We present six new cases that suffered this syndrome from 2015 to 2020: two of them after medulloblastoma surgery; a third one as a consequence of a severe head trauma that required bifrontal craniectomy; another one after craniopharyngioma surgery; a fifth one with leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor; and, finally, a patient carrier a shunt for normotensive hydrocephalus diagnosed ten years before. At the moment of development of this condition, four of them had mid-low-pressure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts. Four patients required cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage at negative pressures oscillating from zero to -15 mmHg by external ventricular drainage until ventricular size normalized, followed by the placement of a new definitive low-pressure shunt, one of them to the right atrium. The duration of drainage in negative pressures through external ventricular drainage (EVD) ranged from 10 to 40 days with concomitant intracranial pressure monitoring at the neurointensive care unit. Approximately 200 cases of this syndrome have been described in the literature. The causes are varied and superimposable to those of high-pressure hydrocephalus. Neurological impairment is due to ventricular size and not to pressure values. Subzero drainage is still the most commonly used method, but other treatments have been described, such as neck wrapping, ventriculostomy of the third ventricle, and lumbar blood patches when associated with lumbar puncture. Its pathophysiology is not clear, although it seems to involve changes in the permeability and viscoelasticity of the brain parenchyma together with an imbalance in CSF circulation in the craniospinal subarachnoid space.

Abstract
  Introduction: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prone positioning can improve gas exchange by promoting uniform lung aeration. However, elevated ventilation pressures may increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and disrupt cerebral autoregulation. This study investigated the effects of PEEP on ICP and cerebral autoregulation in a porcine model with healthy lungs and normal ICP, comparing prone and supine positions. Cerebral autoregulation was assessed through cerebrovascular reactivity using the pressure reactivity index (PRx). We also explored whether other baseline variables influenced potential variances in ICP and PRx.

   Methodology: Twelve anesthetized pigs were randomized to begin in either supine or prone position, across PEEP of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cmH2O. Continuous monitoring included esophageal pressure to calculate end-inspiratory and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressures. The ICM+ R software (University of Cambridge Enterprise, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used for high-resolution data collection, signal processing and ICP curve analysis. Linear mixed-effects models and ANOVA were used to analyze changes in ICP and PRx and the influence of position. An exploratory correlation analysis was conducted on baseline variables potentially related to the ICP increase.

   Results: Mean ICP increase was 1.0mmHg+/-0.9 at 10 cmH2O PEEP, 2.0mmHg+/-1.7 at 15 cmH2O PEEP, and 3.1mmHg+/-1.6 at 20 cmH2O PEEP compared to a baseline PEEP of 5 cmH2O (p<0.001). The effect of PEEP increase on ICP was not influenced by body position. PRx remained unaffected by PEEP. PEEP-induced increases in ICP were higher in cases of higher baseline ICP, higher central venous pressure, lower respiratory system elastance and lower end-inspiratory and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressures.

   Conclusion: Increasing PEEP elevates ICP regardless of body position without adversely affecting cerebral autoregulation in a healthy porcine model. Baseline ICP, central venous pressure, respiratory system elastance and end-inspiratory and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure may influence the magnitude of ICP changes.

Abstract
  Purpose: Divers and individuals working in submarines and other underwater environments are exposed to normoxic hyperbaric conditions frequently. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of hyperbaric normoxia on the retina and choroid.

   Methods: Healthy participants with no prior diving experience were exposed to 2.4 atmospheres absolute pressure in a normoxic hyperbaric chamber (HC). Optical coherence tomography was used to measure retinal thickness, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, and choroidal thickness (CT) before and within 30 minutes after HC exposure.

   Results: The right eyes of 42 participants (mean age, 23.88 +/- 2.85 years) were included in the study. The retinal nerve fiber layer thickness significantly decreased in the central 1-mm Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfield after HC exposure (P < 0.05). The outer plexiform layer showed significant thickening in the central 1-mm ETDRS subfield (P < 0.05). The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thickness in the 3-mm ETDRS subfield significantly decreased after HC exposure (P < 0.01). Furthermore, nasal CT (P < 0.05), temporal CT (P < 0.05), and mean CT (P < 0.01) significantly increased after HC exposure.

   Conclusions: This study is the first in which the effects of a hyperbaric normoxic environment on the retina and choroid were examined. The observed increases in outer plexiform layer and CTs may result from elevated intracranial perfusion pressure, likely owing to increased venous pressure with unchanged cerebral arterial blood flow under hyperbaric normoxic conditions. Elevated intracranial perfusion pressure may also contribute to venous stasis in the retinochoroidal circulation, potentially explaining the structural changes observed in this study.

Abstract
  BackgroundAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) significantly impacts mortality and prognosis in acute neurological injury patients. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is essential in mechanical ventilation to enhance oxygenation, yet its application may elevate intracranial pressure (ICP). Studies show conflicting findings regarding PEEP's effect on ICP, particularly at low to moderate levels (5-10cmH2O), warranting further investigation in acute neurological injury cases.ObjectiveTo assess the impact of low to moderate PEEP on ICP in patients with acute neurological injury who require mechanical ventilation. Methods A retrospective analysis of 62 patients with acute neurological injury requiring mechanical ventilation at our hospital between January 2021 and September 2023 was conducted. Patients were divided into high PEEP (> 10cmH2O) and low to moderate PEEP (5-10cmH2O) groups. Parameters including PaO2, PaCO2, PaO2/FiO2, driving pressure, compliance (Cst), airway resistance, such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac index (CI), ICP, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were recorded pre- and post-ventilation initiation, with correlation analysis performed between ICP and other parameters. Results Pre-treatment comparisons between the high PEEP and low to moderate PEEP groups revealed no significant differences in PaO2, PaCO2, PaO2/FiO2, driving pressure, Cs, and airway resistance. However, post-treatment analysis showed significant disparities, with the high PEEP group exhibiting higher PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 levels and lower PaCO2, driving pressure, and airway resistance levels compared to the low to moderate PEEP group. Additionally, hemodynamic parameters such as HR, SBP, DBP, CI, MAP, CVP, ICP, and CPP remained more stable in the low to moderate PEEP group post-treatment, with ICP demonstrating significant correlations with various physiological parameters. Conclusion High PEEP improves oxygenation and respiratory mechanics in acute neurological injury patients on mechanical ventilation but may affect hemodynamic parameters, ICP, and CPP. Conversely, low to moderate PEEP has minimal impact on these factors. Hence, personalized adjustment of PEEP levels is essential in clinical management.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from the formation of a thrombus in the venous sinuses in the brain, resulting in impaired venous drainage, increased intracranial pressure, and severe neurological deficits. Traumatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but potentially devastating complication of head trauma. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis can present with a variety of symptoms including headache, vomiting, blurred vision, loss of consciousness, seizures, and coma. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is a complication of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis that occurs due to raised intracranial pressure, which in turn stimulates antidiuretic hormone release. The diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is confirmed through neuroimaging. Anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment. The prognosis is variable and depends on several factors including the extent of thrombosis, presence of cerebral hemorrhage, and timing of diagnosis and treatment.

   CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 45-year-old Albanian female who presented with headache and dizziness following a fall and head strike in the context of influenza A. Computed tomography of the brain revealed a stable minimally displaced oblique fracture of the left petrous bone and new dural venous sinus thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, and cranial aspect of the left internal jugular vein. Thrombotic, malignancy, and infectious screens were negative. Our case was successfully managed with anticoagulants. Additionally, the patient developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, which was managed with fluid restriction.

   CONCLUSION: Our case highlights the importance of considering cerebral venous sinus thrombosis as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with dizziness following trauma. Early identification with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging venography and appropriate treatment with anticoagulation therapy are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Shunt systems for hydrocephalus therapy are commonly based on passive mechanical pressure valves that are driven by the intracranial, intra-abdominal, and hydrostatic pressure. The differential pressure acting on the valve determines the drainage rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but is not a gauge of the physiological condition of the patient. Internal and external influences can cause over- or underdrainage and lead to pathological levels of intracranial pressure (ICP).

   METHODS: The first prototype of a ventricular intelligent and electromechanical shunt (VIEshunt) is developed, tested, and compared with previous efforts towards the development of a smart shunt. Its key components are a micro pump, a flow meter, a pressure sensor, an inertial measurement unit, a wireless communication interface, and a microcontroller. The VIEshunt prototype was tested in vitro using a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) test bench that runs real-time patient simulations involving changes in intracranial and intra-abdominal pressure, as well as changes in posture ranging between supine and upright position. The prototype was subsequently tested in an in vivo pilot study based on an acute ovine animal model (n=1) with infusions of artificial CSF.

   RESULTS: During 24 h in vitro testing, the prototype detected the simulated posture changes of the patient and automatically adapted the controller reference. The posture-specific ICP references of 12 mmHg for supine and -3 mmHg for upright position were tracked without offset, thus preventing adverse over- and underdrainage during the investigated HiL test scenario. During acute in vivo testing, the prototype first regulated the mean ICP of a sheep from 22 mmHg down to 20 mmHg. Each of the three subsequent intraventricular bolus infusions of 1 mL saline solution increased mean ICP by approximately 11 mmHg. While natural absorption alone decreased ICP by only 5 mmHg within 9 min, the prototype was able to regulate ICP back to the pre-bolus pressure value within 5 min.

   CONCLUSION: The developed VIEshunt prototype is capable of posture-dependent ICP regulation and CSF drainage control. Smart shunt systems based on VIEshunt could improve patient monitoring and enable optimal physiologic therapy by adapting to the individual patient. To derive statistically relevant conclusions for the performance of VIEshunt, future work will focus on the development of a next generation prototype for use in pre-clinical studies.

Abstract
  Parasagittal meningiomas (PSM) represent one of the most frequently encountered intracranial meningiomas and pose unique challenges given their intimate relationship with parasagittal bridging veins and superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Compromise of venous drainage during resection might be a source of significant postoperative complications including catastrophic intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Objective of this study was to identify postoperative complications and associated factors predisposing to their development. A retrospective review of histologically confirmed parasagittal meningiomas (Sindou grade 1-6) resected between 2011 and 2020 was performed. A total of 62 patients (35 females (56.45%); mean age 55.72) years were included. The mean follow-up was 40.84 months. Forty-two patients (67.74%) were treatment naive. Complete SSS occlusion was noted in 23 (37.1%). WHO grade 1 tumor was diagnosed in 32 (51.61%), WHO 2 in 23 (37.1%) and WHO 3 in 7 cases (11.29%). The SSS was resected in 24 (38.71%) patients. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (ICH) was noted after 8 (12.90%) surgeries. Prior surgery (p = 0.006, OR = 22.1; 95% CI = 2.48-196.5) and higher tumor grade (OR = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.45-14.79, p = 0.01) were independently associated with greater risk of ICH. Resection of the SSS was not associated with postoperative ICH (p = 0.1388). A procedure-related mortality was noted in 2 patients (3.2%). Long term postoperative headaches were reported in 14 (22.58%) patients, associated with the resection of the SSS (p = 0.0003). Four (6.56%) patients had a CSF diversion procedure noted at the last follow up, correlated with ICH (p = 0.0124). History of prior surgery and higher WHO grade seem to be correlated with a significantly elevated risk of hemorrhage. Increased intracranial pressure, requiring CSF diversion is relatively infrequent occurring only in 6% patients, however awareness is important as prevention of its sequela is straightforward, preventing debilitating morbidity.

Abstract
  It is generally accepted that intraocular pressure (IOP) depends on the rate of aqueous humor production, system outflow resistance, and episcleral venous pressure. Therefore, control IOP values are expected to be within the strict and predictable limits in specific animal species, and there should be no vast differences between species. However, in the literature the control IOP values significantly vary (from potentially "hypotensive" to "hypertensive") within the same species, and especially between species depending on the measurement technique, head position in relation to the rest of the body, circadian rhythm, age, and topical and systemic drugs (anesthetics) applied. These variations make it difficult to compare different therapeutic approaches for intraocular hypertension, investigate the correlation between IOP and intracranial pressure, and determine target IOP values in glaucoma research. We recommend that different IOP physiology and pathophysiology studies take into account all the mentioned factors when describing IOP measurement methodology.

Abstract
  Second stage of labor is considered to be associated with an increased risk of intrapartum fetal hypoxic injury. This is due to a combination of several risk factors such as -the increased frequency, strength and duration of uterine contractions due to higher number and affinity of myometrial oxytocin receptors; -the Ferguson's reflex which leads to a reflex release of endogenous oxytocin in response of the distension of the cervix by descending fetal head in late stages of labor; maternal expulsive efforts with the Valsalva manoeuvre that may reduce maternal oxygenation, as well as reduce the venous return and maternal cardiac output due to increased intrathoracic pressure, winch may lead to reduced placental oxygenation; - and increased fetal intracranial pressure due to head compression leading to a potential decrease in fetal cerebral oxygenation. In addition, the umbilical cord often forms one or more loops around the fetal neck, which may get tightened as the head descends leading to an acute and intermittent cessation of fetal oxygenation. Operative interventions during the second stage of labor such as vacuum, forceps or emergency caesarean section may increase the risk of maternal and fetal trauma. Therefore, an accurate interpretation of the fetal heart rate changes by applying the knowledge of fetal pathophysiology is essential: to timely recognise the onset of fetal decompensation preventing intrapartum hypoxic-ischaemic brain injuries; to avoid erroneous monitoring of the maternal heart rate as fetal heart rate; and to abstain from unnecessary operative interventions due to misinterpretation of the significance of the observed fetal heart rate changes.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND Decompressive craniectomy is a common life-saving intervention in the setting of elevated intracranial pressure. Cranioplasty restores the calvarium and intracranial physiology once swelling recedes. Cranioplasty is often thought of as a low-risk intervention. However, numerous reports indicate that malignant cerebral edema (MCE) is an often-fatal complication of an otherwise uneventful cranioplasty. A careful review of the literature is needed to better understand this devastating condition. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old man presented after suffering a gunshot wound to the right frontal lobe. Upon initial evaluation, the patient had grossly visible brain matter, left-sided hemiparesis with a Glascow Coma Score (GCS) of 11, and vital signs concerning for elevated intracranial pressure. Computed tomography (CT) showed right-sided intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage with a 5 mm leftward midline shift. The patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for right fronto-parietal craniectomy. Over the next 3 months, he recovered steadily and underwent PEEK cranioplasty on post-operative day 83. Pre-operative CT showed sunken skin flap syndrome with an 8-mm midline shift. Following an uneventful cranioplasty, he failed to regain consciousness. Examination revealed absent brainstem reflexes. CT showed global diffuse cerebral edema. The patient was declared brain dead. CONCLUSIONS Continued research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of malignant cerebral edema so that future incidences may be prevented. A combination of negative-pressure suction drainage, sunken skin flap syndrome, and delayed time to cranioplasty likely play a significant role in the evolution of MCE. We urge neurosurgeons to consider the likelihood of MCE and adapt surgical planning accordingly.

Abstract
  Skeletal muscle relaxants have their place in everyday use in numerous anesthesiological procedures, such as preparing a patient for surgery, supporting mechanical ventilation, and performing effective intubation. These drugs can be divided, based on their mechanism of action, into depolarizing skeletal relaxants, such as succinylcholine, and non-depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants. Non-depolarizing agents are further categorized, based on their structure, into steroidal (eg, rocuronium) and benzylisoquinoline (eg, atracurium) compounds. To gain better control over neuromuscular blockade and patient recovery, a group of drugs known as reversal agents was developed. The effectiveness of skeletal muscle relaxants can be influenced by factors such as acid-base imbalances, impaired metabolism, and excretion, due to kidney or liver dysfunction, age, and sex. Skeletal muscle relaxants have also been used in neurosurgical procedures. It is believed that these drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier. By reducing intrathoracic pressure and central venous pressure, they can lower intracranial pressure. However, in some studies, an increase in intracranial pressure has been observed. Therefore, selecting the appropriate drug is crucial, particularly for patients with suspected or confirmed elevated intracranial pressure, which is defined as the pressure within the intracranial space relative to atmospheric pressure. Elevated intracranial pressure above normal levels can occur in various conditions, such as sinus thrombosis, aneurysm rupture, brain tumors, intraventricular hemorrhage, and meningitis. In this article, we aim to review the role of muscle relaxants and reversal agents in neurosurgical procedures.

Abstract
  We describe the case of a 72-year-old man who presented with signs of increased intracranial pressure, right-sided motor deficit, and repeated episodes of epilepsy due to a left frontal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a large superficial draining vein. Despite great efforts to protect the vein from the start, it ruptured shortly after we removed the bone flap. This required rigorous hemorrhage control, which in turn led to profuse bleeding from the nidus throughout the process of the dissection and coagulation of the arterial feeders. The postoperative course was initially uneventful; however, the patient declined neurologically and became unresponsive on the second day after surgery. Emergent CT revealed a significant hematoma occupying the space where the AVM nidus had been resected. The patient was taken back to the OR for emergency evacuation of the hematoma. Despite these efforts, the neurological status remained poor, and the patient was transferred to a territorial hospital after spending 3 weeks in the ICU.An early rupture of the venous drainage represents a dreaded complication of AVM surgery, which can compromise the intervention before the start of the definite resection. We discuss our experience of and strategy for preventing and managing the intraoperative venous rupture of AVMs by describing our seven rules of "Don't." We also provide a brief overview of the relevant literature. Copyright © 2025. The Author(s).

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that for rodents, a substantial fraction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drains by crossing the cribriform plate into the nasopharyngeal lymphatics, eventually reaching the cervical lymphatic vessels (CLVs). Disruption of this drainage pathway is associated with various neurological disorders.

   METHODS: We employ a lumped parameter method to numerically model CSF drainage across the cribriform plate to CLVs. Our model uses intracranial pressure as an inlet pressure and central venous blood pressure as an outlet pressure. The model incorporates initial lymphatic vessels (modeling those in the nasal region) that absorb the CSF and collecting lymphatic vessels (modeling CLVs) to transport the CSF against an adverse pressure gradient. To determine unknown parameters such as wall stiffness and valve properties, we utilize a Monte Carlo approach and validate our simulation against recent in vivo experimental measurements.

   RESULTS: Our parameter analysis reveals the physical characteristics of CLVs. Our results suggest that the stiffness of the vessel wall and the closing state of the valve are crucial for maintaining the vessel size and volume flow rate observed in vivo. We find that a decreased contraction amplitude and frequency leads to a reduction in volume flow rate, and we test the effects of varying the different pressures acting on the CLVs. Finally, we provide evidence that branching of initial lymphatic vessels may deviate from Murray's law to reduce sensitivity to elevated intracranial pressure.

   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first numerical study of CSF drainage through CLVs. Our comprehensive parameter analysis offers guidance for future numerical modeling of CLVs. This study also provides a foundation for understanding physiology of CSF drainage, helping guide future experimental studies aimed at identifying causal mechanisms of reduction in CLV transport and potential therapeutic approaches to enhance flow.

Abstract
  Laparoscopy, as the most frequently chosen surgical technique in the world, carries specific complications and distinctions in anesthetic management. Complications of laparoscopy, particularly perceptible as disorders of the physiology of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems, are caused by the specific technical conditions required for this type of operation. To facilitate surgical access and to clarify the surgical field, it is necessary to create a splenic emphysema, consisting of filling the peritoneal cavity with carbon dioxide (CO2). This results in an increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and increased diffusion of CO2 into the blood, causing a state of hypercarbia. The impact of these disturbances is of great importance in the pathological functioning of the above-mentioned organ systems. The anesthetist, in addition to the need to induce a state of general anesthesia, must be aware of and understand the pathological impact of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and hypercarbia to adjust patient monitoring accordingly and implement appropriate treatment targeting the specific complications occurring during laparoscopy. Complications and contraindications important from the anesthetist's point of view are also described. The 51 articles and reference texts were used for this purpose, which, combined with the authors' knowledge and experience, is intended to be a valuable resource for use by anesthesiology staff. This article aims to explain the effects of laparoscopy on human physiology and to compare and contrast methods of airway management, mechanical ventilation, the type of muscle relaxation used, and postoperative management in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

Abstract
  The number of patients with an implanted shunt reaching reproductive age and planning pregnancy is increasing thanks to advances in the treatment of hydrocephalus. Changes in the mother's organism, which are mainly related to the accumulation of water in the organism and the elevation of intra-abdominal pressure, contribute to the increased incidence of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Therefore, it is necessary to make a preconception exam and specify pregnancy management, a suitable method of childbirth dealing with potential complications. Possible malfunction of the shunt is solved individually according to the current neurological findings and taking into account the patient's overall condition and gestational age. Vaginal delivery is considered safe and preferred by most authors. Primary caesarean section is indicated only in patients with a history of rapidly progressing deterioration of the neurological condition due to shunt malfunction or serious complications related to its impaired shunt function. In an uncomplicated pregnancy with normal values of intracranial pressure, both general and epidural or spinal anesthesia can be used when choosing anesthesia.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The exact association between the frequently present anomalous intracranial venous vasculature, emissary collaterals, ventriculomegaly, and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in children with Apert and Crouzon syndromes remains an enigma. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the aberrant venous system and ventricle size and increased ICP, and to assess the development of the venous structures over time.

   METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all patients with Apert or Crouzon syndrome with available CT venography (CTV) scans of the brain. Anomalous venous vasculature was assessed by the total collateral score (TCS), which scored 9 intra- and extracranial venous structures (TCS range 0-16). Ventricle size (fronto-occipital horn ratio [FOHR]) was measured on the same scan. The presence of increased ICP, a shunt, tonsillar herniation, and head circumference were extracted from electronic patient records and were used as secondary covariates. Subsequent CTV scans were scored when available.

   RESULTS: Ninety patients were included in this study. The mean TCS was 7.5 +/- 2.5, and was comparable for patients with Apert and Crouzon syndromes (mean 8.0 and 7.3, respectively). The presence of an extra abnormal venous structure was associated with an increase of the FOHR of 3.2% (p < 0.01). After dividing the venous structures into intra- and extracranial, a similar association between both and the FOHR was found (4.1% and 2.3%, respectively; p < 0.01). The TCS was similar for patients with normal and increased ICP at the time of the scan. Sixteen patients had dual CTV scans. The median time between both scans was 3.2 years. The presence of collaterals remained stable over time (median DELTATCS = 0.3). Seven patients with functioning shunts also maintained high TCSs (median TCS = 9).

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Apert and Crouzon syndromes, a close relationship between venous collaterals and ventricle size was observed, in which a more extensive aberrant venous drainage pattern, both intra- and extracranial, was associated with larger ventricles. Preliminary longitudinal data suggested that the presence of venous collaterals remained constant over time despite effective treatment of increased ICP, indicating reliance on these collaterals even in cases of normal ICP. The authors hypothesize that this dependence on collateral drainage is the result of their aberrant internal venous anatomy and predisposes individuals to increased ICP.

Abstract
  Retrograde cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare complication following internal jugular vein (IJV) ligation. The patient described in this report is a male in his 30s with locally advanced carcinoma tongue. He underwent near-total glossectomy and bilateral neck dissection. Due to heavy nodal burden, his right IJV had to be sacrificed. The patient presented with features of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) postoperatively. Magnetic resonance venogram of the brain revealed CVT involving sigmoid and transverse sinus. This case report describes a perplexing case of right-sided IJV ligation giving rise to CVT, resulting in raised ICP. Although the contralateral cerebral venous system was found to be normal, it failed to compensate for the obstructed outflow on the affected side. In this case report, we have elucidated the possible mechanism for the development of raised ICP and described the management in the light of existing evidence.

Abstract
  Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH) causes brain injury and systemic complications, including cardiopulmonary dysfunction, which mutually affect each other. Post-SAH brain injury includes early brain injury(EBI) and delayed cerebral ischemia(DCI). EBI is a non-iatrogenic pathology occurring within 72 h of clinical SAH, primarily induced by increased intracranial pressure, subsequent transient global cerebral ischemia, and extravasated blood components. DCI typically develops between days 4 and 14 after clinical SAH because of erythrolysis(free hemoglobin) and EBI-mediated reactions. EBI and DCI share many pathologies, including large-artery spasm, microvascular spasm, microthrombosis, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, disturbance of venous outflow, and neuroelectric disturbances such as spreading depolarization and epileptic discharge. However, EBI and DCI differ not only in the timing of onset but also in their distribution, with EBI mainly occurring throughout the brain, while DCI occurs locally. Many substances, such as glutamic acid, cytokines, and matricellular proteins, mediate EBI and DCI pathologies. Further elucidation of EBI and DCI pathologies is essential for developing novel treatment strategies.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare and challenging condition. As implied by the nomenclature, the etiologies remain unknown, and multiple etiologies are being investigated. In this study, we explored the potential role of increased systemic or cerebral venous pressure in the pathogenesis.

   METHOD: An observational cohort study following the STROBE guidelines, including prepubertal children with clinical symptoms and imaging findings consistent with IIH referred to the neurosurgical department, was conducted. The patients underwent a comprehensive diagnostic protocol, including MRI, continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, and endovascular venography with venous pressure measurements.

   RESULTS: The study included 11 consecutive patients (six boys and five girls) with an average age of 2.3 years, and an average BMI of 18.4. Among these, one patient was found to have venous stenosis with a gradient; the other 10 patients presented with normal intracranial anatomy. All patients exhibited elevated venous pressures, with an average superior sagittal sinus pressure of 18.9 mmHg, average internal jugular vein pressure of 17.0 mmHg, and average central venous pressure of 15.9 mmHg. Daytime ICP averaged 12.9 mmHg, whereas nighttime ICP averaged 17.2 mmHg with either A- or B-waves in 10 of the 11 patients. Despite pathological ICP, only three patients had papilledema.

   CONCLUSIONS: All patients had an increased systemic venous pressure, indicating a possible pathological factor for prepubertal IIH. Additionally, our findings show that young children often only partly meet the Friedman criteria due to a lack of papilledema, emphasizing the need for pediatric-specific diagnostic criteria. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and to explore the underlying reasons for this increase in venous pressure and potential new treatment avenues. Copyright © 2024.

Abstract
  Long-duration spaceflight (LDSF) is associated with unique hazards and linked with numerous human health risks including Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). The proposed mechanisms for SANS include microgravity induced cephalad fluid shift and increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP). SANS is a disorder seen only after LDSF and has no direct terrestrial pathologic counterpart as the zero G environment cannot be completely replicated on Earth. Head-down tilt, bed rest studies however have been used as a terrestrial analog and produce the cephalad fluid shift. Some proposed countermeasures for SANS include vasoconstrictive thigh cuffs and lower body negative pressure. Another potential researched countermeasure is the impedance threshold device (ITD) which can reduce ICP. We review the mechanisms of the ITD and its potential use as a countermeasure for SANS.

Abstract
  A 36-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with clinical symptoms of blurred vision of progressive onset of two years of evolution. The ophthalmological examination revealed the existence of bilateral papilledema. Using cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the presence of a right occipital pial arteriovenous malformation was certified. Arteriographically, pial arterial contributions dependent on the right middle cerebral artery and the right posterior cerebral artery were identified. Venous drainage was located at the level of the superior sagittal sinus. An associated right transverse sinus stenosis was also identified. The existence of secondary intracranial hypertension was corroborated by monitoring with an intracranial pressure sensor. An interventional procedure was carried out consisting of embolization of the arterial supplies of the lesion using Onyx R. The clinical-radiological findings after the procedure were favorable: the papilledema disappeared and complete exclusion of the malformation was achieved. A new intracranial pressure measurement showed resolution of intracranial hypertension. Subsequent regulated radiological controls showed complete exclusion of the malformation up to 5 years later.

Abstract
  The rapid perfusion of cerebral arteries leads to a significant increase in intracranial blood volume, exposing patients with traumatic brain injury to the risk of diffuse brain swelling or malignant brain herniation during decompressive craniectomy. The microcirculation and venous system are also involved in this process, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. A physiological model of extremely high intracranial pressure was created in rats. This development triggered the TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB/iNOS axis in microglia, and released many inflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species, generating an excessive amount of peroxynitrite. Subsequently, the capillary wall cells especially pericytes exhibited severe degeneration and injury, the blood-brain barrier was disrupted, and a large number of blood cells were deposited within the microcirculation, resulting in a significant delay in the recovery of the microcirculation and venous blood flow compared to arterial flow, and this still persisted after decompressive craniectomy. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody bound to TNF-alpha that effectively reduces the activity of TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB/iNOS axis. Treatment with Infliximab resulted in downregulation of inflammatory and oxidative-nitrative stress related factors, attenuation of capillary wall cells injury, and relative reduction of capillary hemostasis. These improved the delay in recovery of microcirculation and venous blood flow. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

Abstract
  Comprehensive understanding of venous anatomy is a key factor in the approach to a multitude of conditions. Moreover, the venous system has become the center of attention as a new frontier for treatment of diseases such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), arteriovenous malformation (AVM), pulsatile tinnitus, hydrocephalus, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) venous fistulas. Its knowledge is ever more an essential requirement of the modern brain physician. In this article, the authors explore the descriptive and functional anatomy of the venous system of the CNS in 5 subsections: embryology, dural sinuses, cortical veins, deep veins, and spinal veins.

Abstract
  Cerebral edema frequently develops in the setting of brain infection and can contribute to elevated intracranial pressure, a medical emergency. How excess fluid is cleared from the brain is not well understood. Previous studies have shown that interstitial fluid is transported out of the brain along perivascular channels that collect into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled subarachnoid space. CSF is then removed from the central nervous system through venous and lymphatic routes. The current study tested the hypothesis that increasing lymphatic drainage of CSF would promote clearance of cerebral edema fluid during infection with the neurotropic parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Fluorescent microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging was used to show that C57BL/6 mice develop vasogenic edema 4 to 5 weeks after infection with T. gondii. Tracer experiments were used to evaluate how brain infection affects meningeal lymphatic function, which demonstrated a decreased rate in CSF outflow in T. gondii-infected mice. Next, mice were treated with a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C-expressing viral vector, which induced meningeal lymphangiogenesis and improved CSF outflow in chronically infected mice. No difference in cerebral edema was observed between mice that received VEGF-C and those that rececived sham treatment. Therefore, although VEGF-C treatment can improve lymphatic outflow in mice infected with T. gondii, this effect does not lead to increased clearance of edema fluid from the brains of these mice.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral hemodynamics in infants with congenital heart disease undergoing the Glenn procedure, focusing on the relationship between superior vena cava pressure and estimated ICP.

   DESIGN: A single-center prospective cohort study.

   SETTING: The study was conducted in a cardiac center over 4 years (2019-2022).

   PATIENTS: Twenty-seven infants with congenital heart disease scheduled for the Glenn procedure were included in the study, and detailed patient demographics and primary diagnoses were recorded.

   INTERVENTIONS: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound examinations were performed at three time points: baseline (preoperatively), postoperative while ventilated (within 24-48 hr), and at discharge. TCD parameters, blood pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure were measured.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: TCD parameters included systolic flow velocity, diastolic flow velocity (dFV), mean flow velocity (mFV), pulsatility index (PI), and resistance index. Estimated ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were calculated using established formulas. There was a significant postoperative increase in estimated ICP from 11 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR], 10-16 mm Hg) to 15 mm Hg (IQR, 12-21 mm Hg) postoperatively (p = 0.002) with a trend toward higher CPP from 22 mm Hg (IQR, 14-30 mm Hg) to 28 mm Hg (IQR, 22-38 mm Hg) postoperatively (p = 0.1). TCD indices reflected alterations in cerebral hemodynamics, including decreased dFV and mFV and increased PI. Intracranial hemodynamics while on positive airway pressure and after extubation were similar.

   CONCLUSIONS: Glenn procedure substantially increases estimated ICP while showing a trend toward higher CPP. These findings underscore the intricate interaction between venous pressure and cerebral hemodynamics in infants undergoing the Glenn procedure. They also highlight the remarkable complexity of cerebrovascular autoregulation in maintaining stable brain perfusion under these circumstances. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

Abstract
  Patients diagnosed with low-pressure hydrocephalus typically present with enlarged ventricles and unusually low intracranial pressure, often measuring below 5 cmH2O or even below atmospheric pressure. This atypical presentation often leads to low recognition and diagnostic rates. The development of low-pressure hydrocephalus is believed to be associated with a decrease in the viscoelasticity of brain tissue or separation between the ventricular and subarachnoid spaces. Risk factors for low-pressure hydrocephalus include subarachnoid hemorrhage, aqueduct stenosis, prior cranial radiotherapy, ventricular shunting, and cerebrospinal fluid leaks. For potential low-pressure hydrocephalus, diagnostic criteria include neurological symptoms related to hydrocephalus, an Evans index >0.3 on imaging, ICP <= 5 cm H2O, symptom improvement with negative pressure drainage, and exclusion of ventriculomegaly caused by neurodegenerative diseases. The pathogenesis and pathophysiological features of low-pressure hydrocephalus differ significantly from other types of hydrocephalus, making it challenging to restore normal ventricular morphology through conventional drainage methods. The primary treatment options for low-pressure hydrocephalus involve negative pressure drainage and third ventriculostomy. With appropriate treatment, most patients can regain their previous neurological function. However, in most cases, permanent shunt surgery is still necessary. Low-pressure hydrocephalus is a rare condition with a high rate of underdiagnosis and mortality. Early identification and appropriate intervention are crucial in reducing complications and improving prognosis. Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Rebound intracranial hypertension (RIH) is a post-procedural treatment complication in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) characterized by transient high-pressure headache symptoms. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, risk factors, and treatment options for RIH.

   RECENT FINDINGS: This article discusses how changes in underlying venous pressure and craniospinal elastance can explain symptoms of RIH, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), and SIH. The pathophysiology of RIH provides a clue for how high and low intracranial pressure disorders, such as IIH and SIH, are connected on a shared spectrum. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Symptomatic intracranial hypertension (IH) due to venous outflow obstruction secondary to dural venous sinus (DVS) tumoral invasion affects up to 3% of intracranial meningioma patients. The literature regarding endovascular therapies of such patients is limited to a few case reports and a recent single-centre case series.

   PURPOSE: We describe our single-centre experience of endovascular therapy in patients with clinically symptomatic IH secondary to DVS meningioma invasion.

   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of clinical and radiological data of all patients with refractory IH and meningiomas invading the DVS who were referred for possible DVS venoplasty and stenting. Seven endovascular procedures in six female patients were done. Presumed secondarily induced lateral transverse sinus stenosis was also stented in four patients as part of the primary intervention.

   RESULTS: All patients experienced complete symptomatic resolution at 6-month follow-up. Five patients had no symptom recurrence over a mean follow-up period of 3.5 years. One patient with multiple meningiomas developed recurrent IH 2 years following stenting secondary to in-stent tumour re-invasion. This was re-stented with consequent 6 months post-retreatment symptomatic relief at the time of writing. No procedure-related complications occurred.

   CONCLUSION: In the setting of DVS stenosis secondary to meningioma invasion, endovascular therapy is a safe and successful therapeutic option with promising mid-term results. The procedure should be considered in cases where complete surgical tumour resection is unlikely or carries a significant risk. If present, secondarily induced stenoses at the lateral ends of the transverse sinuses should also be considered for treatment. Copyright © 2024.

Abstract
  Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is broadly used in surgical wound management and more recently burn care; however, the tissue pressure changes and best dressing application technique remains unknown. This study was done to help understand the tissue pressure changes beneath negative pressure when varying the delivered pressures, dressing thickness and distribution of dressings. This study was done in 2021 at a quaternary paediatric burns hospital. Utilising a cadaveric porcine model, an intracranial pressure monitor and transducer were used to assess pressure. The transducer was placed on the epidermis or inserted under ultrasound guidance via cannulation to the dermis, subcutaneous or muscular layer. Mepitel TM, ACTICOAT TM, varying layers of Kerlix TM (10, 20 or 30 layers) and NPWT were then applied either circumferentially or non-circumferentially. Each set of results is indicative of the intracranial pressure probe reading when NPWT was delivered at -40, -60, -80, -100 and -120 mmHg. The median and interquartile pressure recordings were epidermis: -42 (-42.5 - -41), -60.5 (-62.5 - -60), -80.5 (-82 - -80), - 99 (-99 - -98)mmHg (p < 0.001); dermis: 1 (0 - 2), 2 (1 - 3.5), 3 (2 - 5.5), 4 (3 - 7), 5.5 (4 - 7.5)mmHg (p < 0.001) (the increase in pressure was less when circumferential dressings (p < 0.001) or more layers of Kerlix were applied (p < 0.001)); subcutis: 1.5 (-4.5-1), -2.5 (-7.5 - 1.5), -3.5 (-11 - 1.5), -5 (-14 - 1.5) and -6 (-16 - 2)mmHg (p = 006) (the decrease in pressure was less with increased layers of Kerlix (0.047) and muscular: 0 (-0.5 - 0), 0 (-1 - 0.5), 0 (-1 - 1), 0 0 (-1 - 1), 00 (-1.5 - 1)mmHg (p = 0.55). These data suggest negative pressure paradoxically exerts a positive pressure on the dermis. Circumferential and multi-layer dressings reduce this positive pressure. This knowledge has impacted our burn negative pressure wound therapy dressing selection. The limitation of this study is the cadaveric model, a live model is suggested for future studies.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: ERCP is an endoscopic procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of biliopancreatic system diseases. An increase in intra-abdominal pressure due to the insufflation of air to the intestinal lumen may be transmitted to ICP through the course of ERCP. In this prospective, randomized, controlled double-blinded study, we aimed to assess the ICP change using ultrasonography measurement of ONSD in patients undergoing ERCP comparing the effects of propofol and ketofol anesthesia.

   MATERIAL/METHODS: One hundred and nine patients undergoing ERCP under propofol or ketofol anesthesia were enrolled in the study. Ultrasonography measurement of ONSD was performed before (T0) and immediately after induction of anesthesia (T1), during sphincterotomy (T2), at the end of procedure (T3), and after the patient is fully awake (T4).

   RESULTS: Comparison of ONSD values and ONSD alteration between groups showed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). Both groups showed significantly greater changes from T0 to T2 compared with values from T0 to T1, T3, and T4, respectively (P = 0,000). T0 to T3 alteration was also significantly greater than T0 to T1 and T4 change in both groups (P = 0,000).

   CONCLUSIONS: ERCP procedure increases intracranial pressure most prominently during sphincterotomy both under propofol or ketofol anesthesia. Further studies are needed to investigate the impact of this phenomenon on adverse clinical outcomes. Copyright © 2024 Copyright: © 2024 Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: To quantify the effects of CSF pressure alterations on intracranial venous morphology and hemodynamics in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) and assess reversibility when the underlying cause is resolved.

   METHODS: We prospectively examined venous volume, intracranial venous blood flow and velocity, including optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) as a noninvasive surrogate of CSF pressure changes in 11 patients with IIH, 11 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls and 9 SIH patients, before and after neurosurgical closure of spinal dural leaks. We applied multiparametric MRI including 4D flow MRI, time-of-flight (TOF) and T2-weighted half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo-spin echo (HASTE).

   RESULTS: Sinus volume overlapped between groups at baseline but decreased after treatment of intracranial hypotension (p= 0.067) along with a significant increase of ONSD (p= 0.003). Blood flow in the middle and dorsal superior sagittal sinus was remarkably lower in patients with higher CSF pressure (i.e., IIH versus controls and SIH after CSF leak closure) but blood flow velocity was comparable cross-sectionally between groups and longitudinally in SIH.

   CONCLUSION: We were able to demonstrate the interaction of CSF pressure, venous volumetry, venous hemodynamics and ONSD using multiparametric brain MRI. Closure of CSF leaks in SIH patients resulted in symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure and caused a subsequent decrease of intracranial venous volume and of blood flow within the superior sagittal sinus while ONSD increased. In contrast, blood flow parameters from 4D flow MRI did not discriminate IIH, SIH and controls as hemodynamics at baseline overlapped at most vessel cross-sections. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

Abstract
  Traumatic brain injury is often associated with a direct or secondary neurovascular pathology. In this review, we present recent advancements in endovascular neurosurgery that enable accurate and effective vessel reconstruction with emphasis on its role in early diagnosis, the expanding use of flow diversion in pseudoaneurysms, and traumatic arteriovenous fistulas. In addition, future directions in which catheter-based interventions could potentially affect traumatic brain injury are described: targeting blood brain barrier integrity using the advantages of intra-arterial drug delivery of blood brain barrier stabilizers to prevent secondary brain edema, exploring the impact of endovascular venous access as a means to modulate venous outflow in an attempt to reduce intracranial pressure and augment brain perfusion, applying selective intra-arterial hypothermia as a neuroprotection method mitigating some of the risks conferred by systemic cooling, trans-vessel wall delivery of regenerative therapy agents, and shifting attention using multimodal neuromonitoring to post-traumatic vasospasm to further characterize the role it plays in secondary brain injury. Thus, we believe that the potential of endovascular tools can be expanded because they enable access to the "highways" governing perfusion and flow and call for further research focused on exploring these routes because it may contribute to novel endovascular approaches currently used for treating injured vessels, harnessing them for treatment of the injured brain.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Meningiomas invading the intracranial venous sinuses may cause intracranial venous hypertension, papilledema, and visual compromise. Sinus resection and graft reconstructions, however, add significant complexity to tumor surgery, with the potential for increased morbidity. In this study, the authors explored whether venous sinus stenting might provide an alternative means of controlling venous hypertension that would be sustainable over the long term.

   METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of all 16 patients with intracranial meningiomas who underwent stenting at their institution for venous sinus compromise. At presentation, all had headache and 9 had papilledema. Thirteen patients had 1 meningioma and 3 had 2 or more. Three patients had had previous tumor resection and radiotherapy. One patient had been treated with a lumboperitoneal shunt and radiotherapy. The median length of clinical follow-up was 8 years (range 4 months-18 years).

   RESULTS: Venous sinus narrowing was often not confined to the site of meningioma, and bilateral transverse sinus narrowing, reminiscent of that seen in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, was present in 7 patients with sagittal sinus meningiomas. Eleven patients had stents placed solely across sinus narrowing caused by meningioma. Five patients had additional stents placed at other sites of venous narrowing at the same time: in one of these patients, a stent was placed across a defect in the sagittal sinus caused by previous surgery, and in the 4 other patients, stents were placed across nontumor narrowings of the transverse sinuses. In 1 patient, the jugular vein was also stented. Nine patients developed symptomatic in-stent restenosis at the meningioma site. Eight had further stenting procedures with variable success in restoring the in-stent lumen. The remaining patient, with a late partial relapse, is being reinvestigated. Papilledema resolved in all patients after stenting. Six patients experienced prolonged and very substantial relief of all symptoms. Five patients had persistent headache despite restoration of the sinus lumen. Five had persistent symptoms associated with resistant in-stent stenosis. There were no significant complications from any of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients who are symptomatic with meningiomas obstructing the venous sinuses, successful stenting of the affected segment can give a good outcome, especially in terms of relieving papilledema. However, further procedures are often necessary to maintain stent patency, other areas of venous compromise frequently coexist, and some patients remain symptomatic despite apparently successful treatment of the index lesion. Long-term surveillance is a requirement.

Abstract
  Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a condition of negative intracranial pressure resulting from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the dural sac and is a well-known cause of orthostatic headache. Diagnosis and management can be difficult, often requiring coordination between multiple disciplines. Low CSF pressure and diffuse meningeal enhancement on brain MRI are the major instrumental features of the classic syndrome. Neuroimaging plays a key role in diagnosing SIH, particularly in atypical clinical presentations, by recognizing the specific findings of brain sagging on MRI and detecting the level of CSF leak on spinal imaging, thus guiding therapy accordingly. Since SIH could present with such a heterogeneous clinical picture, careful history taking and increased awareness of atypical presentations are of utmost importance. We review the existing SIH literature, illustrate management, clinical and neuroimaging findings of four consecutive patients with atypical SIH, who were recently referred to our hospital for evaluation to simplify and streamline the management of SIH.

Abstract
  Background: Aside from primary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS) with an unknown etiology (i.e., idiopathic intracranial hypertension), which typically occurs in association with obesity, several conditions including cerebral venous abnormalities, drug use, and hormonal imbalance may be a secondary cause of PTCS. However, a focal space-occupying lesion outside of the brain as a cause of PTCS has rarely been reported. Case Presentation: A previously healthy 34-year-old man presented with blurred vision for three weeks. The patient had a three-month preceding history of worsening headache. On admission, he was hypertensive (160/90 mmHg) and underweight with a body mass index of 18.4 kg/m2. Fundus examination documented papilledema in both eyes. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for mild nuchal rigidity, and results of routine serologic testing were normal. Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral posterior scleral flattening, suggesting intracranial hypertension. There was no other abnormal brain parenchymal lesion or meningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assay showed a markedly increased opening pressure (30.0 cmH2O) with normal CSF composition. A tentative diagnosis of PTCS was made based on ophthalmological, neuroradiological, and laboratory findings. During differential diagnosis, abdomen computed tomography demonstrated a huge benign cystic lesion (14.7 x 10.6 x 16.4 cm) in the right retroperitoneal space, which originated from the mesentery and resulted in hydronephrosis and renovascular hypertension due to external compression of the right kidney. Other evaluations were unremarkable. After successful surgical removal of the cyst, clinical symptoms such as headache, blurred vision, and papilledema on fundus examination were markedly improved, and blood pressure was normalized during the three-month follow-up period. Conclusions: A large retroperitoneal cyst that can increase intra-abdominal pressure could be a rare cause of PTCS. Therefore, meticulous evaluation is warranted for patients with PTCS, especially those without known risk factors.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Left ventricular free wall rupture, particularly the blowout type, is still one of the most lethal complications of myocardial infarction and can cause catastrophic cardiac tamponade. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is often used to treat haemodynamic instability due to cardiac tamponade. However, elevated pericardial pressure can cause collapse of the right atrium, resulting in inadequate ECMO inflow and preventing the stabilisation of the circulation. Further, it can interfere with the venous return from the superior vena cava (SVC), increasing the intracranial pressure and reducing cerebral perfusion levels.

   CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man was hospitalised for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We used ECMO for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After the establishment of ECMO, transthoracic echocardiography and left ventriculography revealed massive pericardial effusion. The treatment was supplemented with pericardial drainage since ECMO flow was frequently hampered by suction events. However, the blowout rupture led to the requirement of constant drainage from the pericardial catheter. To tend to this leak, we connected the venous cannula of ECMO and the pericardial drainage catheter. The surgery was performed with stable circulation without suction failure of ECMO. During the course of the intensive care management, the neurological prognosis of the patient was revealed to be poor, and the patient was shifted to palliative care. Unfortunately, the patient died on day 10 of hospitalisation.

   CONCLUSION: We present a case wherein the combination of pericardial drainage and ECMO was used to maintain circulation in a patient with massive pericardial effusion due to cardiac rupture. Copyright © 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Venous sinus stenosis is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Venous stenting has emerged as a promising treatment option for patients with IIH because of venous sinus stenosis refractory to medical management or unsuitable for shunt placement. In this technical note, we present a case of IIH with the highest recorded pressure gradient to date.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: This technical note presents the successful use of intracranial venous stenting in a patient with IIH because of severe venous sinus stenosis, leading to significant improvement in vision and reduction in intracranial pressure. A meticulous review of the literature revealed that our patient exhibited the highest recorded pressure gradient (70 mm Hg). This remarkable finding underscores the potential effectiveness of venous stenting as a viable treatment approach. The procedure involved the placement of a Zilver stent (Cook Medical) and balloon angioplasty after stenting of the right transverse sinus stenosis, resulting in a substantial decrease in pressure gradient. Following the procedure, another venous manometry showed no more gradient with a uniform pressure in the whole venous system at 18 mm Hg.

   CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this case presents the highest pressure gradient reported in the literature and contributes to the growing evidence supporting venous stenting in patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis. Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2023. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Optimal shunt-based hydrocephalus treatments are heavily influenced by dynamic pressure behaviors between proximal and distal ends of shunt catheters. Posture-dependent craniospinal, arterial, venous, and abdominal dynamics thereby play an essential role.

   METHODS: An in-vivo ovine trial (n = 6) was conducted to evaluate communication between craniospinal, arterial, venous, and abdominal dynamics. Tilt-testing was performed between -13degree and + 13degree at 10-min intervals starting and ending at 0degree prone position. Mean pressure, pulse pressure, and Pearson correlation (r) to the respective angle were calculated. Correlations are defined as strong: 

   r

   >= 0.7, mild: 0.3 <

   r

   < 0.7, and weak: 

   r

   <= 0.3. Transfer functions (TFs) between the arterial and adjacent compartments were derived.

   RESULTS: Strong correlations were observed between posture and: mean carotid/femoral arterial (r = - 0.97, r = - 0.87), intracranial, intrathecal (r = - 0.98, r = 0.94), jugular (r = - 0.95), abdominal cranial, dorsal, caudal, and intravesical pressure (r = - 0.83, r = 0.84, r = - 0.73, r = 0.99) while mildly positive correlation exists between tilt and central venous pressure (r = 0.65). Only dorsal abdominal pulse pressure yielded a significant correlation to tilt (r = 0.21). TFs followed general lowpass behaviors with resonant peaks at 4.2 +/- 0.4 and 11.5 +/- 1.5 Hz followed by a mean roll-off of - 15.9 +/- 6.0 dB/decade.

   CONCLUSIONS: Tilt-tests with multi-compartmental recordings help elucidate craniospinal, arterial, venous, and abdominal dynamics, which is essential to optimize shunt-based therapy. Results motivate hydrostatic influences on mean pressure, with all pressures correlating to posture, with little influence on pulse pressure. TF results quantify the craniospinal, arterial, venous, and abdominal compartments as compliant systems and help pave the road for better quantitative models of the interaction between the craniospinal and adjacent spaces.

Abstract
  We report the cases of two patients who underwent normofractionated radiotherapy for evolutive asymptomatic parasagittal meningiomas. After completion of radiotherapy, both patients presented severe headache and vomiting episodes without papillar edema. We then decided a "wait-and-scan" strategy because of the slit-ventricles, and symptoms regressed spontaneously. MRI showed significant tumor regression a year after radiotherapy with a newly developed collateral venous drainage system in the first patient and a left, unusually large, superior anastomotic vein in the second. These clinical presentation and radiological evolution are compatible with venous stenosis caused by radiation-induced symptomatic edema, fading after the development of a collateral venous drainage system. The relation between pressure-related headaches and venous anatomy remains unclear in parasagittal meningiomas. These observations underline the importance of the study of venous anatomy when pressure-related headaches are suspected. Further clinical descriptions might help the clinicians to treat these patients' symptoms. Copyright © 2023 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: According to the literature, higher levels of both intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraabdominal pressure (IAP) are related in a way that suggests a causal relationship. An increase in ICP can cause major neurological problems both during and after laparoscopic surgery. In this study, we aimed to examine the increase in ICP between totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 52 individuals who underwent laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of inguinal hernia (n = 26) or had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 26). The optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) was assessed before the procedure (T0), 10 minutes after carbon dioxide insufflation (T1), and immediately before extubation (T2).

   RESULTS: There were significant differences in the ONSD values between the two groups as a function of time (p = 0.001). In terms of ONSD, the laparoscopic cholecystectomy value (LV) group showed a greater shift from T0 to T1 and T2 than the inguinal hernia value (HV) group. At T1, the ONSD values of both groups were considerably higher than those of T0 and T2. The impact of the extraperitoneal and transperitoneal laparoscopic methods on ICP was investigated. The ONSD value reached its maximum at T1 in both groups. At all measurement periods, the ONSD values of the LV group were noticeably higher than those of the HV group.

   CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of ONSD ultrasonography is an important approach for determining the ICP level. During the decision-making process of TEP inguinal hernia repair, this study can guide medical professionals in the evaluation of elevated ICP.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Venous sinus stenosis, typically at the junction of the transverse and sigmoid sinus, is increasingly recognized as a contributor to the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), whether it be the intrinsic type that does not reverse with normalization of intracranial pressure or the extrinsic type, which does. Efforts to treat the stenosis and reduce the associated transstenotic gradient through placement of a stent at the site of stenosis have been studied over the past 2 decades, primarily through retrospective studies, with variable emphasis on formal visual testing and direct assessment of poststent opening pressure. Most studies have presented evidence for utilization of stenting as an alternative to cerebrospinal fluid shunting or optic nerve sheath fenestration in patients with IIH who harbor the stenosis and are refractory to or intolerant of intracranial pressure-lowering medications, but an assessment of the current data is needed to better understand the role of stenting for this patient population.

   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search in PubMed was made for "IIH," "papilledema," and "venous stenting." Data pre and post stenting, including symptoms attributable to IIH, intracranial pressure, papilledema, retinal nerve fiber layer thickening on optical coherence tomography, and visual field assessment (mean deviation), were collected. Need for retreatment and complications were assessed among all studies. Studies using stenting for special circumstances, such as cerebrospinal leaks or for stenosis along anomalous vessels, were reviewed.

   RESULTS: In total, 49 studies (45 retrospective and 4 prospective) and 18 case reports (with 3 or less patients) were found and included in the analysis, for a total of 1,626 patients. In 250 patients in whom poststent intracranial pressure was measured, the mean value was 19.7 cm H 2 O, reduced from a mean of 33 cm H 2 O. Transient visual obscurations resolved in 79.6% of 201 patients who complained of it, pulsatile tinnitus resolved in 84.7% of 515, diplopia resolved in 93% of 86 patients, and nonspecific visual symptoms such as "blurry vision" improved in 76.2% of 537 patients. Headaches resolved in 36% and improved in a further 40.7% of 1,105 patients in whom they were documented before stenting. Of 1,116 with papilledema, 40.8% demonstrated resolution and 38.2% improvement. The mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness improved from 170.2 microm to 89.2 microm among 402 eyes in which optical coherence tomography was used to measure it. Among 135 eyes in which formal visual fields were performed pre and post stenting, the prestent average mean deviation of -7.35 dB improved to -4.72 dB after stenting. Complications associated with stenting included in-stent stenosis or thrombosis, subdural hematoma, intracerebral hematoma, cerebral edema, stent migration, and death. A recurrence of symptoms requiring a follow-up surgical intervention occurred in 9%.

   CONCLUSIONS: A growing body of evidence supports the use of venous sinus stenting as a viable option for medically refractory IIH, especially when papilledema threatens visual function. Complication and failure rates seem to be similar to alternative surgical approaches, although serious neurological sequalae can rarely occur. Emerging studies evaluating stent type, including novel stents designed for use in the venous system, may help improve ease of the procedure and long-term success rates. Prospective head-to-head studies are needed to better understand the performance of stenting compared with other interventions. Copyright © 2023 by North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: To report a case of venous overload choroidopathy associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension in a 41-year-old man.

   METHODS: History and clinical examination, fluorescein angiography, ultra-widefield indocyanine green angiography, swept-source optical coherence tomography, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.

   RESULTS: The patient was diagnosed as having idiopathic intracranial hypertension 2 years ago, was being managed on oral acetazolamide, and retained 20/20 visual acuity in both eyes until now when he presented with a complaint of visual loss in the right eye. Ophthalmoscopy revealed serous detachment in the fovea of the right eye. Swept-source optical coherence tomography showed the presence of subretinal fluid and detachments of the retinal pigment epithelium in both eyes. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed multiple dot leaks at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium in both eyes. Indocyanine green angiography revealed vortex vein anastomoses and choroidal vascular hyperpermeability in both eyes. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed dilated optic nerve sheath diameter and a partial empty sella and magnetic resonance venography showed bilateral stenosis of the transverse sinus.

   CONCLUSION: Transverse sinus stenosis is a common finding in "idiopathic" intracranial hypertension and contributes to the intracranial pressure through intracranial venous hypertension. Increased venous back pressure seemed to have overloaded the choroid resulting in choroidal vascular congestion and hyperpermeability, leaks from the level of the retinal pigment epithelium, and accumulation of subretinal fluid.

Abstract
  Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis can occur in both previously healthy and immunocompromised hosts. Here, we describe a 55 year-old HIV-negative male with no known prior medical problems, who presented with three months of worsening headaches, confusion, and memory changes without fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated bilateral enlargement/enhancement of the choroid plexi, with hydrocephalus, temporal and occipital horn entrapments, as well as marked periventricular transependymal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seepage. CSF analysis yielded a lymphocytic pleocytosis and cryptococcal antigen titer of 1:160 but sterile fungal cultures. Despite standard antifungal therapy and CSF drainage, the patient had worsening confusion and persistently elevated intracranial pressures. External ventricular drainage led to improved mental status but only with valve settings at negative values. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement could thus not be considered due to a requirement for drainage into the positive pressure venous system. Due to this persistent CSF inflammation and cerebral circulation obstruction, the patient required transfer to the National Institute of Health. He was treated for cryptococcal post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome with pulse-taper corticosteroid therapy, with resultant reductions in CSF pressures along with decreased protein and obstructive material, allowing successful shunt placement. After tapering of corticosteroids, the patient recovered without sequelae. This case highlights (1) the necessity to consider cryptococcal meningitis as a rare cause of neurological deterioration in the absence of fever even in apparently immunocompetent individuals and (2) the potential for obstructive phenomena from inflammatory sequelae and the prompt response to corticosteroid therapy.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Patients with brain damage often require mechanical ventilation. Although lung-protective ventilation is recommended, the application of increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to altered cerebral venous return. This study investigates the effects of flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) using negative end-expiratory pressures (NEEP), on cerebral hemodynamics in a swine model of intracranial hypertension.

   METHODS: A model of intracranial hypertension involving bilateral trepan bolt holes was performed in 14 pigs. Pressure-controlled volume-guaranteed ventilation (PCV-VG) with PEEP and FCV using PEEP and then NEEP were applied. Intracranial pressure and oxygenation, as well as systemic hemodynamics and gas exchange parameters, were continuously monitored. Data were collected at baseline and at varying PEEP levels for both PCV-VG and FCV ventilation modalities. Following this, FCV ventilation and NEEP levels of -3, -6 and -9 cmH2O were applied.

   RESULTS: ICP remained stable with low PEEP levels, but significantly decreased with NEEP. Lower ICP following NEEP improved cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral tissue oxygenation (p < 0.05 for all). FCV with NEEP at EEP-6 and EEP-9 significantly improved cardiac output and mean arterial pressure (MAP), compared to PCV-VG and FCV using PEEP (p < 0.05, respectively). There were no significant differences in gas exchange parameters between modalities (PCV-VG vs FCV), and between the application of PEEP or NEEP. No significant correlations were observed between DELTAICP and DELTAMAP.

   CONCLUSION: The application of FCV with NEEP appears to be a safe ventilation mode and offers an additional tool for controlling severe intracranial pressure episodes. These findings warrant validation in future studies and may lead to important potential applications in clinical practice. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s).

Abstract
  Background Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is still a mainstay of treatment in centers for infants with aqueductal stenosis which is the most common cause of congenital obstructive hydrocephalus. Shunt migration remains a common complication. Delayed distal shunt tip migration into the thoracic cavity due to negative intrathoracic pressure is a rare occurrence. Case Presentation Authors report a 1-year-old infant presenting with drowsy sensorium, increasing head circumference, and bulging anterior fontanelle. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed significant obstructive hydrocephalus with periventricular seepage. A large expansile diverticulum of the suprapineal recess extending infratentorially compressing the dorsal midbrain and cerebellum inferiorly. The child underwent an emergency right-side VP shunt (medium pressure) in view of clinical symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. A right iliac fossa infraumbilical transverse incision was taken for placing the abdominal end. Visual confirmation of bowel was done after opening the peritoneum by two operating surgeons prior to inserting the distal catheter. Postoperative course was uneventful. The child presented 3 months later with acute dyspnea and diminished breath sounds on the right hemithorax. Neurologically, the child was active, feeding well, and anterior fontanelle was lax. A chest roentgenogram and computed tomogram (CT) of the thorax revealed complete shunt migration into the pleural space with significant pleural effusion on the right side. The distal shunt system on CT appeared to enter the pleural space below the 8th rib, probably indicating that there was subcostal tunneling of the shunt below the 8th rib space during the first surgery which was inconspicuous and subsequently over a span of 3 months due to sucking effect of negative intrathoracic pressure the shunt gradually migrated into the pleural cavity which led to the effusion. An emergency VP shunt revision was performed. The distal end below the chamber was retunneled subcutaneously into a new incision in the left paraumbilical region. Postoperative chest and abdomen roentgenograms showed resolving effusion and accurate shunt placement. The child required elective ventilation temporarily to tide over the underlying lung collapse and an intercostal tube drainage for the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrothorax for 2 days to aid in quicker weaning. The child was discharged on the 5th postoperative day. Discussion Intrapleural migration of VP shunts has been contemplated to be due to trauma during surgery, migration across foramen of Bochdalek or Morgagni, and negative intrathoracic pressure. Taub and Lavyne have classified thoracic complications of VP shunt as thoracic trauma during shunt tunneling, supradiaphragmatic migration of shunt or transdiaphragmatic migration of shunt, and pleural effusion complicated by CSF ascites. Transdiaphragmatic migration is commonly seen in pediatric population and supradiaphragmatic migration can be seen in any age group. We believe our case to be a type of supradiaphragmatic migration of the shunt which has occurred slowly over a span of time due to the negative intrathoracic pressure. The idea behind this clinical case image is to edify neurosurgeons, pediatricians, and intensivists to remain wary of such a complication. Copyright Asian Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

Abstract
  Background: African children with cerebral malaria and seizures caused Plasmodium falciparum are at greater risk of poor outcomes including death and neurological sequelae. The agonal events are severe hypoventilation and respiratory arrest often triggered by seizures. We hypothesised that prophylactic anti-seizure medication (ASM) could avert 'spikes' of intracranial pressure during or following seizures and that adequate ventilation could be supported by biphasic Cuirass Ventilation (BCV) which requires no intubation.

   Methods: A Phase I trial conducted in Kilifi, Kenya designed to provide data on safety, feasibility and preliminary data on seizure control using prophylactic ASM (levetiracetam) and BCV as non-invasive ventilatory support in children with cerebral malaria. Children aged 3 months to 12-years hospitalised with P falciparum malaria (positive rapid diagnostic test or a malaria slide), a Blantyre Coma Score <=2 and a history of acute seizures in this illness are eligible for the trial. In a phased evaluation we will study i) BCV alone for respiratory support (n=10); ii) prophylactic LVT: 40mg/kg loading dose then 30mg/kg every 12 hours given via nasogastric tube for 72 hours (or until fully conscious) plus BCV support (n=10) and; iii) prophylactic LVT: 60mg/kg loading dose then 45mg/kg every 12 hours given via nasogastric tube for 72 hours (or until fully conscious) plus BCV support (n=10). Primary outcome measure: cumulative time with a clinically detected seizures or number of observed seizures over 36 hours. Secondary outcomes will be assessed by feasibility or ability to implement BCV, and recovery from coma within 36 hours. Safety endpoints include: aspiration during admission; death at 28 days and 180 days; and de-novo neurological impairments at 180 days.

   Conclusions: This is a Phase I trial largely designed to test the feasibility, tolerability and safety of using non-invasive ventilatory support and LVT prophylaxis in cerebral malaria.

  plain-language-summary
   Unfortunately, children with cerebral malaria continue to have very poor outcomes including severe hypoventilation and respiratory arrest (i.e. breathing is too slow or stops) during hospitalization which is often triggered by seizures. We will explore the potential benefits of a special type of ventilation that applies suction or negative pressure to the chest (meaning keeping children breathing by pushing air in and out of their lungs) in combination with anticonvulsants given before children have had any fits We will use a device called biphasic Cuirass Ventilation (BCV) that can be used by non-specialists to help children breath. BCV applies both negative and positive pressure to the chest, covering both inspiration (breathing in) and expiration (breathing out) phases of breathing, which is more appropriate for periods of when the breathing is too slow or stops for a period of time. We will also use an anticonvulsant drug, called levetiracetam to prevent seizures. It has been safely used in Malawian children and shown to improve outcomes. This will be given directly into the stomach via a nasogastric tube (tubes down the nose into the stomach) The study will be carried out at Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya and plans to enrol 30 children aged 3 months to 12 years with cerebral malaria and a positive malaria test The first ten children with have the BCV device only to assist respiration until they recover from their coma. The next twenty children in the trial will have the BCV device in addition with anticonvulsants given before children have had any fits as a preventive strategy to stop fits. All children will have regular monitoring during the period of coma/ventilation and will be followed up on days 28 and 180. The study aims to generate feasibility and safety data to support future trials.

Abstract
  Hypereosinophilia is a rare condition, defined as a persistent elevation of absolute eosinophil count greater than 1.5x109/L and/or tissue eosinophilia. This condition can be caused by numerous different etiologies, both hematological (clonal) and non-hematological (reactive). Reactive hypereosinophilia encompasses all disorders, including infections. Patients with hypereosinophilia may experience a spectrum of clinical consequences due to multiple organ damage, including neurologic and thrombotic complications, associated with organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening sequelae. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is the term used to describe thrombotic occlusion of veins and/or venous sinuses in the brain. This condition can occur at all ages and CVT related to hypereosinophilia is a rare disease. Diagnosis of the disease must be done quickly because thrombosis causes blockage of cerebral drainage, venous congestion, disruption of cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption, ischemic neuronal damage, cerebral edema, and hemorrhage, leading to severe neurological complications. Management of intracranial hemorrhage from CVT due to hypereosinophilia is a challenging task for clinicians, based on anticoagulation therapy, systemic corticosteroid, management of elevated intracranial pressure, and potentially progressive hemorrhage due to anticoagulant. The outcome of the patient generally relies on early detection, prompt, and appropriate treatment. In this case report, we discuss a rare case of CVT with hypereosinophilia and positive dengue serology in a child, in the context of intracranial hemorrhage, enlightening the importance of considering a personalized strategy in the management of this complex scenario.

Abstract
  Background: Intracranial pressure (ICP)--guided therapy is the standard of care in the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Ideal ICP monitoring technique is not yet available, based on its risks associated with bleeding, infection, or its unavailability at major centers. Authors propose that ICP can be gauged based on measuring pressures of other anatomical cavities, for example, the abdominal cavity. Researchers explored the possibility of monitoring intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) to predict ICP in severe TBI patients.

   Methods: We measured ICP and IAP in severe TBI patients. ICP was measured using standard right frontal external ventricular drain (EVD) insertion and connecting it to the transducer. IAP was measured using a well-established technique of vesical pressure measurement through a manometer.

   Results: A total of 28 patients (n = 28) with an age range of 18-65 years (mean of 32.36 years +/- 13.52 years [Standard deviation]) and the median age of 28.00 years with an interquartile range (21.00-42.00 years) were recruited in this prospective study. About 57.1% (n = 16) of these patients were in the age range of 18-30 years. About 92.9% (n = 26) of the patients were male. The most common mode of injury (78.6%) was road traffic accidents (n = 22) and the mean Glasgow Coma Scale at presentation was 4.04 (range 3-9). The mean ICP measured at the presentation of this patient cohort was 20.04 mmHg. This mean ICP (mmHg) decreased from a maximum of 20.04 at the 0 h' time point (at the time of insertion of EVD) to a minimum of 12.09 at the 96 hr time point. This change in mean ICP (from 0 h to 96 h) was found to be statistically significant (Friedman Test: chi2 = 87.6, P <= 0.001). The mean IAP (cmH2O) decreased from a maximum of 16.71 at the 0 h' time point to a minimum of 9.68 at the 96 h' time point. This change was statistically significant (Friedman Test: chi2 = 71.8, P <= 0.001). The per unit percentage change in IAP on per unit percentage change in ICP we observed was correlated to each other. The correlation coefficient between these variables varied from 0.71 to 0.89 at different time frames. It followed a trend in a directly proportional manner and was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.001) in each time frame of the study. The rise in one parameter followed the rise in another parameter and vice versa.

   Conclusion: In this study, we established that the ICP of severe TBI patients correlates well with IAP at presentation. This correlation was strong and constant, irrespective of the timeframe during the treatment and monitoring. This study also established that draining cerebrospinal fluid to decrease ICP in severe TBI patients is reflected in IAP. The study validates that IAP is a strong proxy of ICP in severe TBI patients.

Abstract
  Hamman syndrome is defined as dissection of air in mediastinum and skin fascia usually due to increased intrathoracic pressure. The air leak tends to make its way into pleural and pericardial layers; however, in rare instances air can also dissect into epidural spaces, regarded as pneumorrhachis. We present a case of a young male with a history of polysubstance abuse and e-vaping, who presented with symptoms of altered mental status. Given the concerning physical examination, a computed tomography of the chest was undertaken, which showed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and pneumorrhachis. The patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit and improved after symptomatic management. The symptoms of pneumorrhachis depend on the volume and location of air in intracranial and intraspinal space. Although asymptomatic in our case, it is crucial for clinicians to be aware that pneumorrhachis with Hamman syndrome can potentially cause neurological deficits and cardiopulmonary arrest in severe cases due to increased intraspinal and intracranial hypertension, emphasising the need for close monitoring.

   LEARNING POINTS: Elevated intrathoracic pressure generated by deep inhalation of an aerosolised product is one of the triggers of air dissection in pleural, pericardial, and mediastinal regions. In rare instances, air can also translocate into intracranial and intraspinal spaces, which is referred to as pneumorrhachis.Mostly asymptomatic, pneumorrhachis has the potential to develop acute neurological deficits due to increased intracranial and intraspinal pressure, validating the need for acute monitoring.Most cases of pneumorrhachis are managed conservatively. However, severe cases warrant decompression or high concentrations of oxygen administration to facilitate air absorption. Copyright © EFIM 2024.

Abstract
  Objectives: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is frequently complicated by subacute subdural hematoma (SDH) and more rarely by bilateral thalamic ischemia. Here, we report a case of SIH-related SDH treated with three epidural patches (EPs), with follow-up of the intracranial pressure and lumbar intrathecal pressure.

   Methods: A 46-year-old man presented bilateral thalamic ischemia, then a growing SDH. After failure of urgent surgical evacuation, he underwent three saline EPs, two dynamic myelography examinations and one digital subtraction angiography-phlebography examination. However, because of no dural tear and no obstacle to the venous drainage of the vein of Galen, no therapeutic procedure was available, and the patient died.

   Results: The case exhibited a progressive increase in the transmission of lumbar intrathecal pressure to intracranial pressure during the three EPs. The EPs may have successfully treated the SIH, but the patient did not recover consciousness because of irreversible damage to both thalami.

   Conclusion: Clinicians should be aware of the bilateral thalamic ischemia picture that may be the presenting sign of SIH. Moreover, the key problem in the pathophysiology of SIH seems to be intraspinal and intracranial volumes rather than pressures. Therefore, intracranial hypotension syndrome might actually be an intraspinal hypovolume syndrome. Copyright © 2024 Engrand, Salardaine, Desilles, Echard, Bourdillon, Williams and Baille.

Abstract
  Introduction: A fixed CSF pressure (CSFp) of 25 cmH2O (18 mmHg) has been utilised to date to define and classify pseudotumour cerebri syndrome (PTCS). Furthermore, ICP monitoring, and CSF infusion tests have not been frequently performed in this group of patients.

   Research question: We aimed to report typical, unusual and unstable patterns of ICP in patients with PTCS.

   Material and methods: We reviewed the recordings of CSF infusion tests and overnight ICP monitoring of patients with suspected or confirmed IIH between January 2003-December 2020. We excluded all patients with a shunt in situ and selected recordings that represented unstable patterns of ICP changes in PTCS.

   Results: 463 CSF infusion tests and 26 ICP monitorings of PTCS patients had been performed in this timeframe. We divided results of observed pattern into two group: those with known venous sinus measurements (Group A) and those without (Group B). Observed recordings formed a total of 5 and 4 different patterns respectively, based on the behaviour of ICP and slow waves at rest, overnight, and during infusion as well as in relationship to the clinical presentation of each patient.

   Discussion and conclusion: Accurate monitoring of ICP in PTCS is quintessential. Full understanding of each element of its pathophysiology and their interaction would be essential and include quantification of the CSF pressure not only as a number, but also with consideration of its dynamic contents. Cerebral venous pressure measurements and/or monitoring may be useful. Consideration of the presence or absence of papilloedema in the context of disturbed CSF dynamics could reveal further diagnostic and therapeutic insights. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

Abstract
  Background: There is increasing recognition of connective tissue disorders and their influence on disease in the general population. A conserved clinical phenotype involving connective tissue disorders and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and associated cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVD) has not been previously described.

   Methods: A single-institution retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients with connective tissue disorders and CVD was performed.

   Results: A total of 86 patients were identified. The majority of these patients carried a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (55%) and most were non-obese (mean body mass index 29.7 kg/m2), Caucasian (90%) females (87%). Most prevalent presenting symptoms included pressure headache (98%), dizziness (90%), tinnitus (92%), and cognitive dysfunction (69%). Aside from CVD and IIH, the most common associated conditions were postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS; 55.8%), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks (51.2%), dysautonomia (45.3%), cranio-cervical instability (37.2%), mast cell activation syndrome (25.6%), and tethered cord syndrome (23.3%). Allergies to medications (87.2%) and surgical tape (19.8%) were also frequent. Despite significantly lower opening pressures on lumbar puncture, headache severity and quality of life scores were reported with the same severity of classic IIH patients, suggesting an underlying hypersensitivity to intracranial pressures and cerebral venous congestion.

   Conclusion: There is a rare but conserved clinical phenotype that has not been described previously that presents with severe IIH symptoms in predominantly young, non-obese Caucasian women with a high associated incidence of dysautonomia, POTS, craniocervical instability, and CSF leaks, among others.

Abstract
  Background: Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) or idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by elevated intracranial pressure without hydrocephalus or mass lesion, with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies and neuroimaging. The exact cause remains uncertain, but potential mechanisms include increased CSF production, impaired CSF absorption, cerebral edema, and abnormal cerebral venous pressure gradients. Patients may present with various accompanying symptoms such as unilateral or bilateral visual obscuration, pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, blurred vision, cognitive difficulties, radicular pain, and typically intermittent horizontal diplopia.

   Case Description: We report a case of a 32-year-old female who initially presented with chronic headaches and oligomenorrhea, which resulted in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) a few years before the initial diagnosis of PTC. Despite receiving maximum medical treatment and undergoing optic nerve sheath fenestration, the patient experienced complete bilateral vision loss. Nearly 5 years later, the patient sought care at our outpatient neurology clinic, presenting with symptoms including tinnitus, left-sided hearing loss, and joint pain with elevated inflammatory markers and headaches. The focus of this research was to discuss the pathophysiology of each of these comorbidities.

   Conclusion: This case report aims to explore the pathophysiological relationships between PTC and concurrent comorbidities, including PCOS, sensorineural hearing loss, empty sella (ES) syndrome, and elevated inflammatory markers. Remarkably, no other PTC case with this unique constellation of concurrent comorbidities have been reported in existing medical literature. The case report underscores the critical importance of early diagnosis of IIH and prompt medical intervention, particularly in patients with PCOS experiencing chronic headaches.

Abstract
  Background: Inflammation was associated with the severity of severe cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) on admission and poor prognosis at discharge. Hereditary protein C/S deficiency (hereditary PCD/PSD) not only promotes thrombosis but also activates the inflammatory response, further inducing venous thrombosis. However, conventional treatments such as standard anticoagulant/endovascular therapy (EVT) do not seem to improve prognosis. Anti-inflammatory therapy may be a new way to treat the disease.

   Methods: We enrolled five patients with acute/subacute severe CVT with hereditary PCD/PSD from January 2020 to July 2022. In addition to standard anticoagulant therapy, all of them were given short-term methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Neurological deficit, increased intracranial pressure, venous recanalization, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers and adverse events were retrospectively described before and after treatment and at 6 months after discharge.

   Results: Inflammatory indexes of all patients were significantly elevated on admission. After methylprednisolone pulse therapy, serum inflammatory indexes including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P=0.043); platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (P=0.043); systemic immune inflammatory index (P=0.043); interleukin-6 (P=0.043) and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (P=0.022) reduced dramatically compared with baseline. CSF inflammatory indexes had a decreasing trend compared with baseline (P>0.05). In terms of venous recanalization, one patient achieved complete recanalization, four patients obtained partial recanalization. Compared with baseline on admission, the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and intracranial pressure were all considerably lower at discharge (P=0.029, P=0.041 and P=0.017). At 6-month follow-up, NIHSS and mRS further declined. During hospitalization and 6-month follow-up, none of the five patients experienced severe steroid-related adverse effects such as recurrence of venous thrombosis, spontaneous fracture or osteonecrosis, and gastroduodenal ulcer.

   Conclusion: Acute/subacute severe CVT with hereditary PCD/PSD has high levels of inflammation. In addition to conventional anticoagulant therapy, early anti-inflammatory therapy using steroids may be necessary. Nevertheless, substantial randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required for further investigation. Copyright © 2023 Hao et al.

Abstract
  A 54-year-old man with no medical history presented to our hospital with vomiting, left hemiplegia, and seizures. On arrival, he was experiencing generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which required him to be intubated and deeply sedated. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed extensive venous sinus obstruction from the superior sagittal sinus to the bilateral sigmoid sinus and cerebral edema with intracranial hemorrhage. An intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor was immediately placed intracranially, and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was performed under ICP monitoring. MT was immediately terminated when the venous sinus was partially recanalized enough to decrease the ICP; then, anticoagulation therapy was initiated. Postoperative follow-up angiography revealed that venous sinus obstruction and intracranial venous perfusion improved over time. Although he had intracranial hemorrhage-induced left hemiplegia and sensory deficits, his condition improved with rehabilitation, and the patient was eventually discharged home. The indication criteria and techniques for MT for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are yet to be established. As in this case, in patients with impaired consciousness due to intracranial hemorrhage or epilepsy, preoperative ICP monitor placement is deemed useful to evaluate venous perfusion during MT and decide the treatment goal.

Abstract
  Transverse sinus (TS) stenosis is common in individuals with venous pulsatile tinnitus (PT). While PT can be addressed by endoluminal or extraluminal methods, the former has shown promise in alleviating symptoms associated with increased intracranial pressure. This study explores the potential of extraluminal methods to alleviate TS stenosis and eliminate PT caused by sigmoid sinus diverticulum. A 31-year-old male patient presenting with left-sided PT, attributed to a large, pedunculated sigmoid sinus diverticulum along with severe ipsilateral TS stenosis and contralateral TS hypoplasia, underwent ipsilateral extraluminal TS decompression surgery following sigmoid sinus wall reconstruction under local anesthesia. Postoperative CT and MR angiography revealed a significant increase in the TS lumen from 0.269 to 0.42 cm2 (56.02%) 2 years after surgery. Cervical Doppler ultrasound demonstrated a 36.07% increase in ipsilateral outflow volume to 16.6 g/s and a 77.63% increase in contralateral outflow volume to 1.35 g/s. In conclusion, this pioneering study showcases the potential of transtemporal TS decompression surgery in creating space for adaptive expansion of the TS lumen. However, the procedure should be reserved for individuals with severely compromised venous return. Copyright © 2023 Hsieh and Wang.

Abstract
  Introduction: Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is the ultimate intervention to lower intracranial pressure (ICP) following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, this intervention is associated with considerable adverse events and a higher proportion of survivors with poor functional outcomes.

   Research question: In a multicompartment system ICP is associated with intraabdominal pressure (IAP) due to cerebral venous outflow from the brain. This is the rationale for decompressive laparotomy (DL) to control ICP after TBI as reported by experimental and retrospective clinical data. The safety profile of DL is superior to DC. This study aims to randomly assign patients with intractable high ICP after severe TBI to DL or DC.

   Material and methods: Among other inclusion criteria, ICP must be above 20 mmHg (1-12 h) despite sedation and all other measures according to current guidelines. The primary outcome is the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale assessed after twelve months. Further secondary outcome measures are compartmental pressure values, complications, etc. After 20 initial patients, results will be reviewed by the ethics committees and safety monitoring board to decide on the enrolment of 80 additional patients.

   Results: The study is designed to provide not only high-quality prospective data for the first time on this treatment approach, its two-stage design (20 + 80 pts) also provides maximum patient safety. This protocol conforms with the SPIRIT 2013 Statement. Ethics approval was granted by our but also 5 other university ethics committees (registration 473/18S).

   Conclusion: Registration was performed prior to study initiation in November 2021 (registration number NCT05115929). Copyright © 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of EUROSPINE, the Spine Society of Europe, EANS, the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies.

Abstract
  In this case study, we describe a 25-year-old male who was admitted due to a severe traumatic brain injury, requiring invasive intracranial pressure monitoring. At 48 hours posttrauma, he developed intracranial hypertension refractory to medical treatment without tomographic changes in the brain. Subsequently, intra-abdominal hypertension and tomographic signs of abdominal surgical pathology were observed. An exploratory laparotomy was performed with an intraoperative diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia. After surgical intervention for the abdominal pathology, intracranial pressure was restored to physiological values with a favorable recovery of the patient. In this report, the relationship between intracranial pressure and intra-abdominal pressure is discussed, highlighting the delicate association between the brain, abdomen, and thorax. Measures should be taken to avoid increases in intra-abdominal pressure in neurocritical patients. When treating intracranial hypertension refractory to conventional measures, abdominal causes and multiple compartment syndrome must be considered. The cranial compartment has physiological interdependence with other body compartments, where one can be modified by variations from another, giving rise to the concept of multiple compartment syndrome. Understanding this relationship is fundamental for a comprehensive approach of the neurocritical patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a comatose patient post-traumatic brain injury, who developed medically unresponsive intracranial hypertension secondary to acute mesenteric ischemia, in which surgical resolution of intra-abdominal pathology resulted in intracranial pressure normalization and restitutio ad integrum of neurological status.

Abstract
  Background: Cerebral autoregulation is the mechanism that allows to maintain the stability of cerebral blood flow despite changes in cerebral perfusion pressure. Maneuvers which increase intrathoracic pressure, such as the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), have been always challenged in brain injured patients for the risk of increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) and altering autoregulation. The primary aim of this study is to assess the effect of PEEP increase (from 5 to 15 cmH2O) on cerebral autoregulation. Secondary aims include the effect of PEEP increase on ICP and cerebral oxygenation. Material and Methods: Prospective, observational study including adult mechanically ventilated patients with acute brain injury requiring invasive ICP monitoring and undergoing multimodal neuromonitoring including ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral oxygenation parameters obtained with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and an index which expresses cerebral autoregulation (PRx). Additionally, values of arterial blood gases were analyzed at PEEP of 5 and 15 cmH2O. Results are expressed as median (interquartile range). Results: Twenty-five patients were included in this study. The median age was 65 years (46-73). PEEP increase from 5 to 15 cmH2O did not lead to worsened autoregulation (PRx, from 0.17 (-0.003-0.28) to 0.18 (0.01-0.24), p = 0.83). Although ICP and CPP changed significantly (ICP: 11.11 (6.73-15.63) to 13.43 (6.8-16.87) mm Hg, p = 0.003, and CPP: 72.94 (59.19-84) to 66.22 (58.91-78.41) mm Hg, p = 0.004), these parameters did not reach clinically relevant levels. No significant changes in relevant cerebral oxygenation parameters were observed. Conclusion:  Slow and gradual increases of PEEP did not alter cerebral autoregulation, ICP, CPP and cerebral oxygenation to levels triggering clinical interventions in acute brain injury patients.

Abstract
  Non-invasive ventilation application in neurocritical care with risk of pneumocephalus is controversial. Non-invasive ventilation-related increased intrathoracic pressure increases intracranial pressure via direct transmission of intrathoracic pressure to the intracranial cavity. In addition, increased thoracic pressure decreases venous return to the heart and increases vena jugularis interna pressure, thereby increasing cerebral blood volume. Pneumocephalus is one of the major concerns after non-invasive ventilation application in head/brain trauma patients. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation may be performed in limited conditions in head trauma/brain surgery with appropriate and close monitoring. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy can provide higher FiO2 as manifested by a larger increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and provide the theoretical basis in pneumocephalus because augmenting the PaO2 more effectively would accelerate nitrogen (N2) washout. As a result, non-invasive mechanical ventilation may be performed in limited manner in head trauma/ brain surgery with appropriate and close monitoring.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The late presentation of dural tears (LPDT) has a low incidence rate and hidden symptoms and is easily ignored in clinical practice. If the disease is not treated in time, a series of complications may occur, including low intracranial pressure headache, infection, pseudodural cyst formation, and sinus formation. Here, we describe two cases of LPDT.

   CASE SUMMARY: Two patients had sudden fever 1 wk after lumbar surgery. Physical examination showed obvious tenderness in the operation area. The patients were confirmed as having LPDT by lumbar magnetic resonance imaging and surgical exploration. One case was caused by continuous negative pressure suction and malnutrition, and the other was caused by decreased dural ductility and low postoperative nutritional status. The first symptom of both patients was fever, with occasional headache. Both patients underwent secondary surgery to treat the LPDT. Dural defects were observed and dural sealants were used to seal the dural defects, then drainage tubes were retained for drainage. After the operation, the patients were treated with antibiotics and the patients' surgical incisions healed well, without fever or incision tenderness. Both recovered and were discharged 1 wk after the operation.

   CONCLUSION: LPDT is a rare complication of spinal surgery or neurosurgery that has hidden symptoms and can easily be overlooked. Since it may cause a series of complications, LPDT needs to be actively addressed in clinical practice. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Abstract
  Recognition of similarities between chronic fatigue syndrome and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has raised suggestions that they might be connected, with chronic fatigue syndrome representing a mild version of IIH, sharing many of its symptoms, but without the signature features of elevated intracranial pressure that characterize the complete syndrome. A further development of this idea factors in the effects of a cerebrospinal fluid leak, a known complication of IIH, to explain cases where symptoms seem out of proportion to the apparent physiological disturbance. Cranial venous outflow obstruction has been proposed as the pathological substrate. We describe a patient with multiple symptoms, including headache and disabling fatigue, in which this model guided investigation and treatment. Specifically, CT and catheter venography identified focal narrowings of both jugular and the left brachiocephalic veins. Treatment of brachiocephalic obstruction was not feasible. However, in separate surgical procedures, relief of jugular venous obstruction produced incremental and significant clinical improvements which have proven durable over the length of follow-up. We suggest that investigating chronic fatigue syndrome under this model might not only bring benefit to individual patients but also will provide new insights into IIH and its relationship with spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

Abstract
  Objective: Tinnitus-a common clinical symptom-can be categorized into pulsatile tinnitus (PT) and non-PT. Among these, PT is usually associated with sigmoid sinus symptoms, such as sigmoid sinus wall defect or diverticulum, for which various surgical treatments are available. We have discussed the clinical efficacy of surgery for sigmoid sinus-associated PT via the transmastoid approach in this study.

   Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 4 patients who underwent surgery for sigmoid sinus-associated PT via the transmastoid approach at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital from January to December 2020. Of these, 2 patients had sigmoid sinus wall defect and 2 had sigmoid sinus diverticulum. Post-operative tinnitus grading and surgical efficacy were determined.

   Results: After surgery, PT dissolved in 3 patients, while tinnitus significantly decreased in 1 patient. During the follow-up period of 12-18 months, none of the 4 patients showed complications related to increased intracranial pressure or venous sinus thrombosis, and tinnitus symptoms disappeared in 3 patients without recurrence, although 1 patient occasionally developed tinnitus. Postoperative thin-slice CTA of the temporal bone indicated that the sigmoid sinus bone wall defect or diverticulum was completely repaired with a thick soft tissue coverage.

   Conclusion: Surgical repair of sigmoid sinus-associated PT via the transmastoid approach deserves clinical promotion as it exhibited better efficiency while being relatively less invasive.

Abstract
  Salinity gradient power, which converts Gibbs free energy of mixing to electric energy through an ion-selective pore, has great potential. Towards practical use, developing membrane-scaled nanoporous materials is desirable and necessary. Unfortunately, the presence of a significant ion concentration polarization (ICP) lowers appreciably the power harvested, especially at a high pore density. To alleviate this problem, we suggest applying an extra pressure difference DELTAP across a membrane containing multiple nanopores, taking account of the associated power consumption. The results gathered reveal that the application of a negative pressure difference can improve the power harvested due to the enhanced selectivity. In addition, if the pore density of a membrane is high, raising its pore length is necessary to make the energy harvested economic. For example, if the pore length is 2000 nm and the pore density is 2.5 x 109 pores per cm2, an increment in the power density of 213 mW m-2 can be obtained by applying DELTAP = -1 bar at pH 11 and 323 K, where a net positive power density can be retrieved. The performance of the system considered under various conditions is examined in detail, along with associated mechanisms.

Abstract
  Aim: To characterise the ophthalmic indications for, and ophthalmic efficacy of, transverse sinus stenting in adults with medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken on a single-author database of 226 successive patients with confirmed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). A total of 32 patients were identified who received a transverse sinus stent for medically refractory disease. This which was defined as visual threat and/or intolerance of maximal medical therapy. Patients with medically refractory disease proceeded to stenting, if found to have a significant transverse sinus stenosis gradient at catheter venography. Visual threat was quantified via the degree of papilledema on optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fibre layer, and via the visual field mean deviation. CSF opening pressure at lumbar puncture and cerebral venous sinus pressure measurements from catheter venography were correlated with the ophthalmic data, noting also intolerance of maximal medical therapy. Complications of stenting were fully assessed.

   Results: Medically refractory IIH was found in 18% of the total cohort of IIH patients. 90% of those with medically refractory disease had a significant transverse sinus stenosis pressure gradient, and 80% proceeded to stenting. The intervention eliminated papilledema in 96% of stented patients, and allowed 81% to cease acetazolamide. The need for a further procedure was low at 6%, and the safety profile was favourable.

   Conclusions: Medically refractory disease in IIH is common (18%), and nearly always associated with a significant transverse sinus stenosis pressure gradient (90%). Endovascular stenting of the stenosis deserves wider uptake as a highly effective, safe, and usually definitive treatment. It safeguards vision by eliminating papilledema (96%), and allows most patients to cease acetazolamide (81%). By analogy with glaucoma, if acetazolamide is the prostaglandin of IIH and CSF diversion the emergency glaucoma filter, stenting is the minimally invasive glaucoma surgery.

Abstract
  Internal jugular agenesis is a vascular malformation that is often associated with a history of recurrent headache. Due to the resulting abnormalities in intracranial venous drainage, it may be complicated by neurological dysfunction, such as intracranial hypertension, intracranial micro-thromboses, and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The simultaneous presence of jugular vein agenesis and thrombosis is possible in cases of acute illness, hormonal treatment, pregnancy, hypomobility, or venous drainage abnormalities (VDA) (e.g., May-Thurner syndrome). In particular, the literature still lacks data on thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with jugular vein agenesis. Here, we report a positive experience with prophylaxis using enoxaparin during pregnancy in a patient with internal jugular agenesis. Copyright © 2022 Di Micco, Orlando, Cataldo and Imbalzano.

Abstract
  Perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (PNSAH) is a distinctive disease, representing SAH centered in perimesencephalic cisterns, with negative angiography findings. In recent years, the number of patients with PNSAH has increased significantly; however, the knowledge of PNSAH is insufficient. Therefore, we performed a review of the literature from a PubMed search and recounted our understanding of PNSAH. In this review, we summarized that current high-resolution computed tomography angiography is an acceptable replacement for digital subtraction angiography to rule out aneurysms in PNSAH with strict criteria. The current hypothesis about the etiology of PNSAH is that there is deep vein rupture from aberrant venous anatomy and increased intracranial venous pressure. PNSAH is associated with mild symptoms and lower rates of hydrocephalus and symptomatic vasospasm. For PNSAH, conservative treatment has been the mainstream treatment. PNSAH has a benign clinical course and an excellent prognosis; in long-term follow-up, re-bleeding and death were uncommon. Copyright © 2022 Hou and Yu.

Abstract
  Subdural hematoma (SDH) is one of the most lethal types of traumatic brain injury. SDH caused by Intracranial Pressure Reduction (ICPR) is rare, and the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report three cases of SDH that occurred after substandard cupping therapy and are conjected to be associated with ICPR. All of them had undergone cupping treatments. On the last cupping procedure, they experienced a severe headache after the cup placed on the occipital-neck junction (ONJ) was suddenly removed and were diagnosed with SDH the next day. In standard cupping therapy, the cups are not usually placed on the ONJ. We speculate that removing these cups on the soft tissue over the cisterna magna repeatedly created localized negative pressure, caused temporary but repeated ICPR, and eventually led to SDH development. The Monro-Kellie Doctrine can explain the mechanism behind this - it states that the intracranial pressure is regulated by a fixed system, with any change in one component causing a compensatory change in the other. The repeated ICPR promoted brain displacement, tearing of the bridging veins, and development of SDH. The literature was reviewed to illustrate the common etiologies and therapies of secondary ICPR-associated SDH. Despite the popularity of cupping therapy, its side effects are rarely mentioned. This case is reported to remind professional technicians to fully assess a patient's condition before cupping therapy and ensure that the cups are not placed at the ONJ.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The authors' objective was to measure the effect of posterior cranial vault distraction (PCVD) plus foramen magnum decompression (FMD) on dural sinus volume and venous flow in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.

   METHODS: The volumes of the sagittal, straight, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses of 5 consecutive patients with syndromic craniosynostosis who underwent PCVD+FMD were calculated in cubic centimeters with T2-weighted volumetric MRI sequences before surgery, immediately after surgery, and after the end of the distraction process. Tridimensional reconstructions of phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography (PC-MRA) images were obtained with multiplanar reconstruction (MPR).

   RESULTS: The average total volume of all dural sinuses increased immediately after surgery (from 10.06 cm3 to 12.64 cm3) and continued to increase throughout the 30-day distraction period (from 12.64 cm3 to 14.71 cm3) (p = 0.04), except that the right sigmoid sinus remained stable after the initial increase. The most important increases were observed for the left transverse sinus (+113.2%), right transverse sinus (+104.3%), left sigmoid sinus (+91.3%), and sagittal sinus (+41.8%). Less important modifications were evident for the right sigmoid sinus (+33.7%) and straight sinus (+23.4%). Significant improvements in venous flow were noted on the tridimensional reconstructions of the PC-MRA images. Venous obstruction grading score improved in 4 patients (average [range] 2.4 [ 2-5]) (p = 0.023) and remained stable in 1 patient. All patients had chronic tonsillar herniation (CTH) (mean [range] 16.6 [8-26] mm), and 3 had syringomyelia. CTH showed improvement on the last follow-up MRI evaluation in 4 patients (mean [range] 10.5 [0-25] mm) and worsened from 15 mm to 19 mm in 1 patient. Syringomyelia improved in 2 patients and remained unchanged in 1.

   CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided the first radiological evidence of the impact of craniofacial surgery on dural sinus anatomy and venous drainage. The venous anomalies described in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis are not static, and PCVD+FMD triggers a dynamic process that can lead to significant modifications of intracranial venous drainage. The traction exerted by the distracted bone flap onto the occipitoparietal dura mater adherent to the inner calvaria may account for the enlargement of the dural sinus throughout the distraction period. The impact of these modifications on venous pressure, intracranial pressure, CTH, and hydrocephalus remains to be determined.

Abstract
  The monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) is essential for the detection and treatment of most craniocerebral diseases. Invasive methods are the most accurate approach to measure ICP; however, these methods are prone to complications and have a limited range of applications. Therefore, non-invasive ICP measurement is preferable in a range of scenarios. The current non-invasive ICP measurement methods comprise fluid dynamics, and ophthalmic, otic, electrophysiological, and other methods. This article reviews eight methods of non-invasive estimation of ICP from ocular measurements, namely optic nerve sheath diameter, flash visual evoked potentials, two-depth transorbital Doppler ultrasonography, central retinal venous pressure, optical coherence tomography, pupillometry, intraocular pressure measurement, and retinal arteriole and venule diameter ratio. We evaluated and presented the indications and main advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Although these methods cannot completely replace invasive measurement, for some specific situations and patients, non-invasive measurement of ICP still has great potential.

Abstract
  In this review, we provide an update on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of adults with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and implications of the cerebral venous system, highlighting the progress made during the past decade with regard to mechanisms of the venous outflow pathway and its connection with the cerebral glymphatic and lymphatic network in genesis of IIH. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for favorable visual outcomes and to avoid vision loss, but there is also a risk of overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis in many patients with IIH. We also present details about treatment of intracranial hypertension, which is possible in most cases with a combination of weight loss and drug treatments, but also in selected cases with surgical interventions such as optic nerve sheath fenestration, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) diversion, or dural venous sinus stenting for some patients with cerebral venous sinus stenosis, after careful analysis of mechanisms of intracranial hypertension, patient clinical profile, and method risks.

Abstract
  Objectives: We identified a new type of shunt malfunction (SM) in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). It is induced by weight change and can be treated with valve readjustment. There were two types of SM as follows: Underdrainage induced by the weight gain and overdrainage induced by the weight loss. This study aims to elucidate this mechanism by assessing the shunt pressure environment.

   Methods: The total pressure environment of the shunt system was prospectively studied in patients with shunted NPH at Osaka Medical College Hospital from 1999 to 2005. We measured the pressure environment during the initial pressure setting of the valve by the intracranial pressure (ICP) guide, after setting the valve, and when SM was suspected. We evaluated ICP, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), and hydrostatic and perfusion pressures of the shunt system in the sitting and supine positions. The target ICP for valve setting was empirically set at the range from -8 to -13 mm Hg in the sitting position, referring to the external auditory meatus. During the study period, we identified five cases of SM induced by weight change and assessed the changes in the pressure environment across pre-SM, SM, and post-SM.

   Results: In four cases of underdrainage, gait disturbance worsened with an average weight gain of 6.8 +/- 1.2 kg. With weight gain, IAP and ICP increased by 8.8 +/- 1.6 and 4.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, respectively. Consequently, ICP increased to -6.5 +/- 1.9 mm Hg. One overdrainage patient developed an asymptomatic chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) with a weight loss of 10 kg. With the weight loss, both IAP and ICP decreased by 5 mm Hg, and concomitantly, ICP decreased to -18 mm Hg. In all patients, the valve readjustment restored their ICP to the target pressure. After the valve readjustment, the gait disturbance improved immediately, and the CSDH disappeared after 1 month.

   Conclusion: In patients with shunts, the weight change was linked to ICP via IAP. Due to the weight change, the underdrainage occurred when ICP was above the target pressure, and the overdrainage occurred when ICP was below it. We named this SM as the weight and abdominal pressure-induced shunt trouble. The patients with SM along with weight changes should be the first to be tried for the valve readjustment.

Abstract
  The present study aims to develop a suitable animal model for evaluating the physiological interactions between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, hemodynamics, and abdominal compartment pressures. We seek to contribute to the enhanced recognition of the pathophysiology of CSF-dependent neurological disorders like hydrocephalus and the improvement of available treatment options. To date, no comprehensive animal model of CSF dynamics exists, and establishing an accurate model will advance our understanding of complex CSF physiology. Persisting knowledge gaps surrounding the communication and pressure propagation between the cerebrospinal space and adjacent anatomical compartments exacerbate the development of novel therapies for neurological diseases. Hence, the need for further investigation of the interactions of vascular, craniospinal, and abdominal pressures remains beyond dispute. Moreover, the results of this animal study support the optimization of in vitro test benches for medical device development, e.g., ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Six female white alpine sheep were surgically equipped with pressure sensors to investigate the physiological values of intracranial, intrathecal, arterial, central venous, jugular venous, vesical pressure, and four differently located abdominal pressures. These values were measured simultaneously during the acute animal trial with sheep under general anesthesia. Both carotid and femoral arterial blood pressure indicate a reliable and comparable representation of the systematic blood pressure. However, the jugular venous pressure and the central venous pressure in sheep in dorsal recumbency do not correlate well under general anesthesia. Furthermore, there is a trend for possible comparability of lateral intraventricular and lumbar intrathecal pressure. Nevertheless, animal body position during measurements must be considered since different body constitutions can alter the horizontal line between the cerebral ventricles and the lumbar subarachnoid space. While intra-abdominal pressure measurement in the four different abdominal quadrants yielded greater inter-individual variability, intra-vesical pressure measurements in our setting delivered comparable values for all sheep. We established a novel and comprehensive ovine animal model to investigate interdependent physiologic pressure propagation and multiparameter influences on CSF dynamics. The results of this study will contribute to further in vitro bench testing, the derivation of novel quantitative models, and the development of a pathologic ovine hydrocephalus model.

Abstract
  Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a significant public health and financial concern that is affecting tens of thousands of people in the United States annually. There were over a million hospital visits related to TBI in 2017. Along with immediate and short-term morbidity from TBI, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can have life-altering, chronic morbidity, yet the direct linkage of how head impacts lead to this pathology remains unknown. A possible clue is that chronic traumatic encephalopathy appears to initiate in the depths of the sulci. The purpose of this study was to isolate the injury mechanism/s associated with blunt force impact events. To this end, drop tower experiments were performed on a human head phantom. Our phantom was fabricated into a three-dimensional extruded ellipsoid geometry made out of Polyacrylamide gelatin that incorporated gyri-sulci interaction. The phantom was assembled into a polylactic acid 3D-printed skull, surrounded with deionized water, and enclosed between two optical windows. The phantom received repetitive low-force impacts on the order of magnitude of an average boxing punch. Intracranial pressure profiles were recorded in conjunction with high-speed imaging, 25 k frames-per-second. Cavitation was observed in all trials. Cavitation is the spontaneous formation of vapor bubbles in the liquid phase resulting from a pressure drop that reaches the vapor pressure of the liquid. The observed cavitation was predominately located in the contrecoup during negative pressure phases of local intracranial pressure. To further investigate the cavitation interaction with the brain tissue phantom, a 2D plane strain computational model was built to simulate the deformation of gyrated tissue as a result from the initiation of cavitation bubbles seen in the phantom experiments. These computational experiments demonstrated a focusing of strain at the depths of the sulci from bubble expansion. Our results add further evidence that mechanical interactions could contribute to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and also that fluid cavitation may play a role in this interaction.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Based on their clinical and radiological patterns, idiopathic CSF rhinorrhea and idiopathic intracranial hypertension can represent different clinical expressions of the same underlying pathological process. Transverse sinus stenoses are associated with both diseases, resulting in eventual restriction of the venous CSF outflow pathway. While venous sinus stenting has emerged as a promising treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, its efficiency on idiopathic CSF leaks has not been very well addressed in the literature so far. The purpose of this study was to report the results of transverse sinus stenting in patients with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea associated with transverse sinus stenoses.

   METHODS: From a prospectively collected database, the authors retrospectively collected the clinical and radiological features of the patients with spontaneous CSF leakage who were treated with venous sinus stenting.

   RESULTS: Five female patients were included in this study. Transverse sinus stenoses were present in all patients, and other radiological signs of idiopathic intracranial hypertension were present in 4 patients. The median transstenotic pressure gradient was 6.5 mm Hg (range 3-9 mm Hg). Venous stenting resulted in the disappearance of the leak in 4 patients with no recurrence and no subsequent meningitis during the follow-up (median 12 months, range 6-63 months).

   CONCLUSIONS: According to the authors' results, venous sinus stenting may result in the disappearance of the leak in many cases of idiopathic CSF rhinorrhea. Larger comparative studies are needed to assess the efficiency and safety of venous stenting as a first-line approach in patients with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea associated with transverse sinus stenoses.

Abstract
  Objective: We report a patient with chronic headache due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) associated with transverse sinus (TS) stenosis. The symptom improved after stent placement at the site of stenosis.

   Case Presentation: The patient was a 37-year-old woman with progressive headache and diplopia as chief complaints. She had severe bilateral papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography revealed stenosis of the bilateral TS. Lumbar puncture demonstrated raised intracranial pressure and IIH was tentatively diagnosed. Visual impairment progressed despite oral acetazolamide therapy. A venous pressure gradient was monitored during stent placement. The pressure gradient improved after stenting. Dual antiplatelet therapy was initiated 1 week before the procedure. Papilledema and headache resolved immediately after the procedure. No in-stent stenosis or occlusion occurred during the follow-up period.

   Conclusion: Stent placement for TS stenosis can improve the cerebral venous return in IIH patients. Although restenosis is possible, venous sinus stenting is considered an effective treatment. Copyright ©2021 The Japanese Society for Neuroendovascular Therapy.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is an effective treatment for several disorders of cerebrospinal fluid flow. A rare complication involves postoperative migration of the distal catheter out of the intraperitoneal compartment and into the subcutaneous space. Several theories attempt to explain this phenomenon, but the mechanism remains unclear.

   OBSERVATIONS: The authors report the case of a 37-year-old nonobese woman who underwent placement of a VP shunt for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Postoperatively, the distal catheter of the VP shunt migrated into the subcutaneous space on three occasions despite the use of multiple surgical techniques, including open and laparoscopic methods of abdominal catheter placement. Notably, the patient repeatedly displayed radiographic evidence of chronic bowel distention consistent with increased intraperitoneal pressure.

   LESSONS: In this case, the mechanism of catheter migration into the subcutaneous space did not appear to be caused by pulling of the catheter from above but rather by expulsion of the catheter from the peritoneum. Space in the subcutaneous tissues caused by open surgical placement of the catheter was permissive for this process. Patients with chronic increased intraabdominal pressure, such as that caused by bowel distention, obesity, or Valsalva maneuvers, may be at increased risk for distal catheter migration.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is a successful procedure for treating noncommunicating hydrocephalus as an alternative to initial ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement and as a salvage procedure when a VP shunt fails. Physiological changes of pregnancy can lead to VP shunt failure and complicate the management of shunt malfunction, particularly in the third trimester.

   OBSERVATIONS: The authors present a case in which an ETV was successfully used in the third trimester (31 weeks of gestation) of pregnancy for acute hydrocephalus due to VP shunt malfunction, and the patient went on to deliver a healthy baby at term; the patient remained well in the long-term follow-up. An English-language PubMed literature review revealed four cases of VP shunt failure successfully treated with an ETV in the first or second trimester but no such reports in the third trimester of pregnancy.

   LESSONS: ETV appears to be a safe and effective alternative to VP shunt replacement in the late prenatal period of pregnancy. Copyright © 2021 The authors.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Negative-pressure hydrocephalus (NePH) is a rare clinical entity that presents on the background of ventriculomegaly with atypical symptoms. Its diagnosis is difficult, and some patients experience several shunt revisions until the proper solution is found.

   OBSERVATIONS: The authors present a patient who developed acute deterioration due to iatrogenic NePH after surgery for a vertebral artery thrombosed giant aneurysm. The deterioration occurred after the insertion of a lumbar drain by which the authors intended to reduce a postoperative subcutaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection. The drainage created an unexpected negative-pressure gradient in the CSF spaces, which resulted in NePH. Interventions, such as extraventricular drainage and blood patch, corrected the negative transmantle pressure and stabilized the patient's condition.

   LESSONS: Because the pathophysiology of NePH is theoretically considered to be caused by negative transmantle pressure, the intervention should be performed in order to deal with the coexistence of obstruction in the CSF pathways and a CSF leak. A blood patch would be an effective option in treating the CSF leak when the site of leakage is certain. This is the first case in which a blood patch was effectively applied in the treatment for NePH with a favorable outcome without any permanent CSF diversion. Copyright © 2021 The authors.

Abstract
  Objective Patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal surgery have historically been restricted from using straws postoperatively, due to the concern that this activity generates negative pressure. The objective of this study is to evaluate the pressure dynamics in the sinonasal cavity associated with the use of a straw. Methods Intracranial pressure catheters were placed in the nasal cavity of 20 healthy individuals. Pressure measurements were then recorded while participants drank liquids of different viscosities from a cup and from a straw. Measurements were recorded with and without subjects occluding their nose to simulate postoperative nasal obstruction. Results The average pressure in the nasal cavity while drinking water from a cup was -0.86 cmH 2 O, from a straw was -1.09 cmH 2 O, and while occluding the nose and using a straw was -0.81 cmH 2 O. The average pressure in the nasal cavity while drinking a milkshake from a cup was -0.98 cmH 2 O, from a straw was -1.88 cmH 2 O, and while occluding the nose and using a straw was -1.37 cmH 2 O. There was no statistically significant difference in pressure measurements when comparing either task or consistency ( p  > 0.05). Conclusion Straw use is not associated with the generation of significant negative pressure in the nasal cavity. The pressure generated when drinking from a straw is not significantly different from that of drinking from a cup. This data suggest that straw use may be safe for patients following endoscopic skull base surgery, but further investigation is warranted. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a respiratory/ventilation procedure that is used to maintain or improve breathing in clinical and experimental cases that exhibit impaired lung function. Body fluid shift movement is not monitored during PEEP application in intensive care units (ICU), which would be interesting specifically in hypotensive patients. Brain injured and hypotensive patients are known to have compromised cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation (AR) but currently, there is no non-invasive way to assess the risk of implementing a hypotensive resuscitation strategy and PEEP use in these patients. The advantage of electrical bioimpedance measurement is that it is noninvasive, continuous, and convenient. Since it has good time resolution, it is ideal for monitoring in intensive care units (ICU). The basis of its future use is to establish physiological correlates. In this study, we demonstrate the use of electrical bioimpedance measurement during bleeding and the use of PEEP in pig measurement. In an anesthetized pig, we performed multimodal recording on the torso and head involving electrical bioimpedance spectroscopy (EIS), fixed frequency impedance plethysmography (IPG), and bipolar (rheoencephalography - REG) measurements and processed data offline. Challenges (n=16) were PEEP, bleeding, change of SAP, and CO2 inhalation. The total measurement time was 4.12 hours. Systemic circulatory results: Bleeding caused a continuous decrease of SAP, cardiac output (CO), and increase of heart rate, temperature, shock index (SI), vegetative - Kerdo index (KI). Pulse pressure (PP) decreased only after second bleeding which coincided with loss of CBF AR. Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) increased during PEEP challenges as a function of time and bleeding. EIS/IPG results: Body fluid shift change was characterized by EIS-related variables. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy was used to quantify the intravascular, interstitial, and intracellular volume changes during the application of PEEP and simulated hemorrhage. The intravascular fluid compartment was the primary source of blood during hemorrhage. PEEP produced a large fluid shift out of the intravascular compartment during the first bleeding period and continued to lose more blood following the second and third bleeding. Fixed frequency IPG was used to quantify the circulatory responses of the calf during PEEP and simulated hemorrhage. PEEP reduced the arterial blood flow into the calf and venous outflow from the calf. Head results: CBF AR was evaluated as a function of SAP change. Before bleeding, and after moderate bleeding, intracranial pressure (ICP), REG, and carotid flow pulse amplitudes (CFa) increased. This change reflected vasodilatation and active CBF AR. After additional hemorrhaging during PEEP, SAP, ICP, REG, CFa signal amplitudes decreased, indicating passive CBF AR. 1) The indicators of active AR status by modalities was the following: REG (n=9, 56 %), CFa (n=7, 44 %), and ICP (n=6, 38 %); 2) CBF reactivity was better for REG than ICP; 3) REG and ICP correlation coefficient were high (R2 = 0.81) during CBF AR active status; 4) PRx and REGx reflected active CBF AR status. CBF AR monitoring with REG offers safety for patients by preventing decreased CBF and secondary brain injury. We used different types of bioimpedance instrumentation to identify physiologic responses in the different parts of the body (that have not been discussed before) and how the peripheral responses ultimately lead to decreased cardiac output and changes in the head. These bioimpedance methods can improve ICU monitoring, increase the adequacy of therapy, and decrease mortality and morbidity. Copyright © 2021 Leslie D. Montgomery, Richard W.

Abstract
  Introduction: A pressure gradient of over 8 mm Hg across the stenosis (usually located in the transverse-sigmoid junction) is one of the criteria for cerebral venous stenting in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients. The possible inaccuracy of the traditional microcatheter-based pressure measurements has been discussed in previous studies. In the cardiology field, a dual-sensor pressure wire is routinely used for the evaluation of stenotic lesions. Using a pressure wire for cerebral vasculature was previously discussed in a small case series and case reports. In this study, we compared venous pressure measurements obtained using both a microcatheter and a pressure wire in patients who were candidates for stenting. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted, comparing the two methods of pressure measurements in 26 patients with venous stenosis. Altogether, 120 measurements were performed using both methods. Demographic characteristics, medical history, procedural details, medications, indications for the procedure, and complications were collected from the patient charts. Results: Based on an 8-mm Hg pressure gradient cutoff indication, 19 patients were found eligible to go through unilateral venous stenting based on catheter measurements alone. The wire results corroborated the catheter results in detecting all cases indicated for a stent. This finding implies a sensitivity equal to 100% for the wire measurements. There were no wire-related complications, demonstrating its safety. Conclusions: We conclude that the pressure wire is as safe as the microcatheter and can identify cases requiring intervention. A larger-scale study is needed to assess the measurement accuracy of the pressure wire in brain vasculature.

Abstract
  Purpose: The management and prognostic assessment of pediatric polytrauma patients can pose substantial challenges. Trauma scores developed for adults are not universally applicable in children. An accurate prediction of the severity of trauma and correct assessment of the necessity of surgical procedures are important for optimal treatment. Several trauma scores are currently available, but the advantages and drawbacks for use in pediatric patients are unclear. This study examines the value of the trauma scores Injury Severity Score (ISS), Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS), National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) for the assessment of the polytraumatized child. Methods: In a retrospective study, 97 patients aged 0-17 years who presented with polytrauma and an ISS >=16 in the trauma bay were included in the study. Patient records including radiological studies were analyzed. Pathological imaging findings and emergency surgery were assessed as outcome variables and the predictive value of the trauma scores were analyzed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Statistical significance was set at an alpha level of P <= 0.05. Results: In this study, 35 of the 97 studied children had pathological cranial computed findings. These either underwent craniectomy or trepanation or a parenchymal catheter was placed for intracranial pressure monitoring. Abdominal trauma was present in 45 patients, 16 of which were treated surgically. Forty-three patients arrived with thoracic injuries, 10 of which received a thoracic drainage. One child underwent an emergency thoracotomy. Predictive accuracy for emergency surgery calculated using receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves was highest for ISS and NACA scores (0,732 and 0.683, respectively), and lower for GCS (0.246) and PTS (0.261). Conclusion:  In our study cohort, initial ISS and NACA scores better predicted operative interventions and outcome than PTS or GCS for polytraumatized pediatric patients.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Single-ventricle congenital heart disease (CHD) in pediatric patients with Glenn and Fontan physiology represents a unique physiology requiring the surgical diversion of the systemic venous return from the superior vena cava (Glenn) and then the inferior vena cava (Fontan) directly to the pulmonary arteries. Because many of these patients are on chronic anticoagulation therapy and may have right-to-left shunts, arrhythmias, or lymphatic disorders that predispose them to bleeding and/or clotting, they are at risk of experiencing neurological injury requiring intubation and positive pressure ventilation, which can significantly hamper pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output. The aim of this study was to describe the complex neurological and cardiopulmonary interactions of these pediatric patients after acute central nervous system (CNS) injury.

   METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed the records of pediatric patients who had been admitted to a quaternary children's hospital with CHD palliated to bidirectional Glenn (BDG) or Fontan circulation and acute CNS injury and who had undergone intubation and mechanical ventilation. Patients who had been admitted from 2005 to 2019 were included in the study. Clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, cardiovascular and pulmonary data, and intracranial pressure data were collected and analyzed.

   RESULTS: Nine pediatric single-ventricle patients met the study inclusion criteria. All had undergone the BDG procedure, and the majority (78%) were status post Fontan palliation. The mean age was 7.4 years (range 1.3-17.3 years). At the time of acute CNS injury, which included traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, and cerebral infarct, the median time interval from the most recent cardiac surgical procedure was 3 years (range 2 weeks-11 years). Maintaining normocarbia to mild hypercarbia for most patients during intubation periods did not cause neurological deterioration, and hemodynamic profiles were more favorable as compared to periods of hypocarbia. Hypocarbia was associated with unfavorable hemodynamics but was necessary to decrease intracranial hypertension. Most patients were managed using low mean airway pressure (MAWP) in order to minimize the impact on preload and cardiac output.

   CONCLUSIONS: The authors highlight the complex neurological and cardiopulmonary interactions with respect to partial pressure of arterial CO2 (PaCO2) and MAWP when pediatric CHD patients with single-ventricle physiology require mechanical ventilation. The study data demonstrated that tight control of PaCO2 and minimizing MAWP with the goal of early extubation may be beneficial in this population. A multidisciplinary team of pediatric critical care intensivists, cardiac intensivists and anesthesiologists, and pediatric neurosurgeons and neurologists are recommended to ensure the best possible outcomes.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a debilitating condition that has traditionally been difficult to treat. In recent years, there has been increasing focus on the role of intracranial venous hypertension in the pathophysiology of IIH. Based on increased understanding of this pathophysiology, venous sinus stenting (VSS) has emerged as a safe and reliable treatment for a certain population of patients with IIH. Stratifying patients with IIH based on the status of their venous outflow can provide insight into which patients may enjoy reduction in their symptoms after VSS and provides information regarding why some patients may have symptom recurrence. The traditional view of IIH as a disease due to obesity in young women has been cast into doubt as the understanding of the role of intracranial venous hypertension has improved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) can infrequently lead to chronical intracranial hypertension (IH) due to the altered venous drainage. The aim of this study was to ascertain the risk of IH after CVST and to stratify underlying risk factors.

   METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all cases treated for acute CVST at our department between 2013 and 2019. IH was diagnosed at follow-up according to the modified Dandy criteria. CVST-patients with and without IH were descriptively compared conforming to available clinical and radiological data as well as outcomes.

   RESULTS: Our study included 102 patients with acute CVST. In 70 cases complete follow-up data was available (68.6%). Seven of these patients developed symptomatic intracranial hypertension (10%; N = 7, n = 70) within a median follow-up of 6 months. Four of these patients (57.1% (N = 4, n = 7) vs. 3.2% (N = 2, n = 63); p < 0.001) presented recurrent sinus thrombosis in the further course. There were no significant differences between patients with or without IH concerning gender, age, risk factors, occluded vessels and treatment for their CVST. However the presence of visual deterioration at initial admission was higher in patients who developed IH afterwards (57.1% (N = 4, n = 7) vs. 20.6% (N = 13, n = 63); p = 0.03). Patients with chronic IH after CVST showed significantly less likely recanalization of the occluded vessel on follow-up MRI (no recanalization in 28.6% (N = 2, n = 7) vs. 4.8% (N = 3, n = 63); p = 0.02). All patients with IH had a good outcome (mRS 0-2) at discharge and follow-up.

   CONCLUSION: IH occurred in around 10% after CVST. Insufficient recanalization status may facilitate IH. Patients with visual disturbances seem to develop more likely IH afterwards. Patients who present IH after CVST may develop recurrent cerebral venous thrombosis.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Thrombosis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) is extremely rare, being central catheterization the most common cause. We present a case of a patient with an unusual appearance of neurological symptoms as a consequence of thrombosis of the IJV secondary to miliary tuberculosis.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old woman with disseminated tuberculosis, with multiple lymphadenopathy, axillary, cervical, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and inguinal, presented with clinical evidence of intracranial hypertension. A diagnostic cerebral angiography was performed, which revealed an occluded left internal jugular and venous stasis in the entire cerebral venous system. The patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin, with which she had an adequate evolution.

   CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis is capable of generating a state of hypercoagulability, in addition to a mechanical compression effect due to cervical lymphadenopathy. We report an unusual clinical presentation, with intracranial involvement due to IJV thrombosis secondary to miliary tuberculosis. So far, there are no cases with a similar presentation described above. Copyright: © 2020 Surgical Neurology International.

Abstract
  Pregnancy-related cerebrovascular disease is a serious complication of pregnancy and puerperium. The etiology and pathological mechanisms of cerebrovascular disease are complex, involving changes in the cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems. Vascular risk factors during pregnancy and puerperium may cause vasospasm and endothelial cell damage leading to cerebral ischemia, hemorrhage, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Arterial or venous obstruction may damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and impede venous return, resulting in cerebral edema, hemorrhage, and intracranial hypertension. Pregnancy with hypercoagulability may threaten the lives of both the mother and the developing fetus. With improvements in stroke treatment during pregnancy and puerperium, neuroradiologists have gained new insights into this problem. This article reviews the pathogenesis, imaging findings, and risk factors of stroke during pregnancy and puerperium, focusing on imaging diagnosis and prognostic assessment.

Abstract
  In keeping with its status as one of the major causes of disability and mortality worldwide, brain damage induced by cerebral arterial disease has been the subject of several decades of scientific investigation, which has resulted in a vastly improved understanding of its pathogenesis. Brain injury mediated by venous etiologies, however, such as cerebral, jugular, and vertebral venous outflow disturbance, have been largely ignored by clinicians. Unfortunately, this inattention is not proportional to the severity of cerebral venous diseases, as the impact they exact on the quality of life of affected patients may be no less than that of arterial diseases. This is evident in disease sequelae such as cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)-mediated visual impairment, epilepsy, and intracranial hypertension; and the long-term unbearable head noise, tinnitus, headache, dizziness, sleeping disorder, and even severe intracranial hypertension induced by non-thrombotic cerebral venous sinus (CVS) stenosis and/or internal jugular venous (IJV) stenosis. In addition, the vertebral venous system (VVS), a large volume, valveless vascular network that stretches from the brain to the pelvis, provides a conduit for diffuse transmission of tumors, infections, or emboli, with potentially devastating clinical consequences. Moreover, the lack of specific features and focal neurologic signs seen with arterial etiologies render cerebral venous disease prone to both to misdiagnoses and missed diagnoses. It is therefore imperative that awareness be raised, and that as comprehensive an understanding as possible of these issues be cultivated. In this review, we attempt to facilitate these goals by systematically summarizing recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of these entities, including CVT, CVS stenosis, and IJV stenosis, with the aim of providing a valid, practical reference for clinicians.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The relationship between idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and cerebral sinovenous stenosis (CSS) remains unclear. The effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion on venous sinus physiology have not been rigorously investigated. We describe the effect of ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement on sinovenous pressures in the setting of IIH and CSS.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient in their 30 s presented with headache and transient visual obscurations for few months and was diagnosed with IIH. Catheter cerebral venography showed focal stenosis of the right transverse sinus (TS) with a trans-stenosis pressure gradient (TSG) of 20 mmHg. The patient was treated with VPS. During the procedure, we performed a real-time measurement of ventricular CSF and cerebral sinovenous pressures. VPS selectively reduced the TS pressure and abolished the preoperative TS-TSG within 20 min of CSF diversion without altering the sigmoid sinus (SS) pressure. Our findings suggest that CSS can be an epiphenomenon, rather than the primary etiology in some patients with IIH.

   CONCLUSION: IIH is a challenging condition, in certain patients the radiographic stenosis and trans-stenosis gradient were an epiphenomenon because of the increased intracranial pressure that resulted in reversible TS-SS stenosis. Copyright: © 2020 Surgical Neurology International.

Abstract
  Advances in multiparametric brain monitoring have allowed us to deepen our knowledge of the physiopathology of head injury and how it can be treated using the therapies available today. It is essential to understand and interpret a series of basic physiological and physiopathological principles that, on the one hand, provide an adequate metabolic environment to prevent worsening of the primary brain injury and favour its recovery, and on the other hand, allow therapeutic resources to be individually adapted to the specific needs of the patient. Based on these notions, this article presents a decalogue of the physiological objectives to be achieved in brain injury, together with a series of diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for achieving these goals. We emphasise the importance of considering and analysing the physiological variables involved in the transport of oxygen to the brain, such as cardiac output and arterial oxygen content, together with their conditioning factors and possible alterations. Special attention is paid to the basic elements of physiological neuroprotection, and we describe the multiple causes of cerebral hypoxia, how to approach them, and how to correct them. We also examine the increase in intracranial pressure as a physiopathological element, focussing on the significance of thoracic and abdominal pressure in the interpretation of intracranial pressure. Treatment of intracranial pressure should be based on a step-wise model, the first stage of which should be based on a physiopathological reflection combined with information on the tomographic lesions rather than on rigid numerical values.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Acute low-pressure hydrocephalus (ALPH) is characterized by clinical manifestations of an apparent raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and ventriculomegaly despite measured ICP that is below the expected range (i.e., typically <= 5 cm H2O). ALPH is often refractory to standard hydrocephalus intervention protocols and the ICP paradox commonly leads to delayed diagnosis. The aim of this study was to characterize ALPH and develop an algorithm to facilitate diagnosis and management for patients with ALPH.

   METHODS: EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases were searched for ALPH cases from its first description in 1994 until 2019. Cases that met inclusion criteria were pooled with cases managed at the authors' institution. Patient characteristics, presenting signs/symptoms, precipitating factors, temporizing interventions, definitive treatment, and patient outcomes were recorded.

   RESULTS: There were 195 patients identified, with 42 local and 153 from the literature review (53 pediatric patients and 142 adults). Decreased level of consciousness was the predominant clinical sign. The most common etiologies of hydrocephalus were neoplasm and hemorrhage. While the majority of ALPH occurred spontaneously, 39% of pediatric patients had previously undergone a lumbar puncture. Prior to ALPH diagnosis, 92% of pediatric and 39% of adult patients had a ventricular shunt in situ. The most common temporizing intervention was subatmospheric CSF drainage. The majority of patients underwent a shunt insertion/revision or endoscopic third ventriculostomy as definitive ALPH treatment. Although the mortality rate was 11%, 83% of pediatric and 49% of adult patients returned to their pre-ALPH neurological functional status after definitive treatment. Outcomes were related to both the severity of the underlying neurosurgical disease causing the hydrocephalus and the efficacy of ALPH treatment.

   CONCLUSIONS: ALPH is an underrecognized variant phenotype of hydrocephalus that is associated with multiple etiologies and can be challenging to treat as it frequently does not initially respond to standard strategies of CSF shunting. With early recognition, ALPH can be effectively managed. A management algorithm is provided as a guide for this purpose.

Abstract
  Spontaneous intracranial hypotension describes the clinical syndrome brought on by a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Orthostatic headache is the key symptom, but others include nausea, vomiting, and dizziness, as well as cognitive and mood disturbance. In severe cases, the brain slumps inside the cranium and subdural collections develop to replace lost CSF volume. Initial treatment is by bed rest, but when conservative measures fail, attention is focused on finding and plugging the leak, although this can be very difficult and some patients remain bedbound for months or years. Recently, we have proposed an alternative approach in which obstruction to cranial venous outflow would be regarded as the driving force behind a chronic elevation of CSF pressure, which eventually causes dural rupture. Instead of focusing on the site of rupture, therefore, investigation and treatment can be directed at locating and relieving the obstructing venous lesion, allowing intracranial pressure to fall, and the dural defect to heal. The case we describe illustrates this idea. Moreover, since there was a graded clinical response to successive interventions relieving venous obstruction, and eventual complete resolution, it also provides an opportunity to consider particular symptoms in relation to cerebral venous insufficiency in its own right.

Abstract
  Acute liver failure (ALF) is an infrequent, unpredictable, potentially fatal complication of acute liver injury (ALI) consequent to varied etiologies. Etiologies of ALF as reported in the literature have regional differences, which affects the clinical presentation and natural course. In this part of the consensus article designed to reflect the clinical practices in India, disease burden, epidemiology, clinical presentation, monitoring, and prognostication have been discussed. In India, viral hepatitis is the most frequent cause of ALF, with drug-induced hepatitis due to antituberculosis drugs being the second most frequent cause. The clinical presentation of ALF is characterized by jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy. It is important to differentiate ALF from other causes of liver failure, including acute on chronic liver failure, subacute liver failure, as well as certain tropical infections which can mimic this presentation. The disease often has a fulminant clinical course with high short-term mortality. Death is usually attributable to cerebral complications, infections, and resultant multiorgan failure. Timely liver transplantation (LT) can change the outcome, and hence, it is vital to provide intensive care to patients until LT can be arranged. It is equally important to assess prognosis to select patients who are suitable for LT. Several prognostic scores have been proposed, and their comparisons show that indigenously developed dynamic scores have an edge over scores described from the Western world. Management of ALF will be described in part 2 of this document. Copyright © 2020 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) maps collect DPOAE emissions over a broad range of frequencies and ratios. One application of DPOAE mapping could be monitoring changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) in space, where non-invasive measures of ICP are an area of interest. Data were collected in two experiments to statistically assess changes in DPOAE maps. A repeatability study where four maps per subject were collected across four weeks to establish "normal" variability in DPOAE data, and a posture study where subjects were measured supine and prone with lower body negative pressure, lower body positive pressure (LBPP), and at atmospheric pressure. DPOAE amplitude maps were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping and random field theory. Postural changes produced regional changes in the maps, specifically in the range of 5-7.5 kHz and between primary tone ratios of 1.13-1.24. These regional changes were most pronounced in the prone LBPP condition, where amplitudes were lower from baseline for the Postural Cohort than the Repeatability Cohort. Statistical parametric mapping provided a sensitive measure of regional DPOAE map changes, which may be useful clinically to monitor ICP noninvasively in individuals or for research to identify differences within in cohorts of people.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease process of abnormally increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion. Medical management, optic nerve fenestration, and surgical shunting procedures have failed to produce consistently successful results. In an unknown percentage of cases, IIH is caused by dural venous sinus obstruction which can be cured by endovascular treatment with dural venous sinus stent placement. This helps prevent progressive vision loss and worsening papilledema caused by underlying increased intracranial pressure from venous outflow obstruction. Patients are required to have an established diagnosis of IIH, preferably made by a neuroophthalmologist, with clearly documented papilledema or at minimum visual disturbance along with lumbar puncture opening pressure greater than 25 cm H 2 O. Transverse to sigmoid sinus focal narrowing (intraluminal filling defect or extrinsic compression) must be seen during the venous phase of neuroangiography (NA) along with a pressure gradient of 10 mm Hg or greater across the focal narrowing during dural venous sinus pressure monitoring. A successful reduction is defined as a pressure gradient of less than 10 mm Hg after stent placement. Neuroophthalmologic follow-up occurs within 1 to 2 months to assess for changes in papilledema. If papilledema is unchanged or worsened, NA and hemodynamic evaluation is repeated for consideration of restenting. Appropriate patient selection criteria are required for IIH venous sinus stenting. The utilization of refined endovascular techniques along with postprocedure follow-up protocols can ultimately cure IIH for a select group of patients. Copyright © Thieme Medical Publishers.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare condition characterized by elevated intracranial pressure due to impaired cerebral venous drainage, potentially leading to life-threatening consequences. We searched the PubMed electronic database for 'cerebral venous sinus thrombosis' and 'prothrombotic' cases reported in adults (19+ years) and conducted a systematic review for the published literature in the English language pooled with a case from our institution. Data were analyzed regarding patient demographics, risk factors, clinical features, treatment modalities, and outcomes when available. Thirty cases of CVST were identified (29 case reports, of whom two were described in a case series, and the one case from our institution). The patients' mean age was 39 years (range: 19 - 65). The male: female ratio was 1.14:1. The majority (73.3%) had at least one preexisting risk factor, with prescription drug use being the most common risk factor (33.3%) shared among all patients. Most patients (83.3%) presented with at least two symptoms. The most common presenting symptoms were headache (70%), gastrointestinal disturbance (50%), and seizures (40%). Focal deficits (36.7%), vision disturbances (30%), and altered consciousness (20%) were the remaining presenting complaints. Twelve cases (40%) commented on papilledema, with 10 (83.3%) having papilledema present. Anticoagulation abnormalities were examined in 26 cases (86.7%), out of which four cases (15.4%) had isolated protein S (PS) deficiency, three cases (11.5%) had isolated antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency, and one case (3.8%) had isolated protein C (PC) deficiency. The most common initial imaging modality (22 cases, 73.3%), and most commonly used overall (23 cases, 76.7%), was computed tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the second most common imaging modality for initial use (five cases, 16.7%), diagnosis or confirmation of CVST (eight cases, 26.7%), and overall (21 cases, 70%). Heparin treatment was involved in the treatment of 18 cases (60%), and warfarin treatment was used in 10 cases (33.3%). Heparin-warfarin combination treatment was utilized in eight cases (26.7%). Most patients survived (28 cases, 93.3%), while the two remaining patients died secondary to brain death from the CVST (6.7%). The findings from this study highlight the clinical characteristics of CVST. Therefore, this study aims to increase awareness of this rare entity. Physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in order to diagnose patients presenting in the proper clinical context, given this case shares various forms of presentations with other common clinical conditions but requires long-term anticoagulation.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Neurenteric cysts are rare lesions that typically present in the upper thoracic and cervical spine and are occasionally found intracranially. The optimal treatment is gross total excision as subtotal/partial excisions are associated with high recurrence rates.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: For the past 10 years, a patient with pseudotumor cerebri required repeated lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt revisions. This resulted in multiple neuroenterogenous cysts occurring around the proximal LP subarachnoid shunt catheter, a finding likely attributable to retrograde flow from the peritoneal cavity.

   CONCLUSION: Unlike ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts and LP shunts do not contain valves, making the retrograde passage of enterogenous cells possible when abdominal pressure exceeds lumbar subarachnoid pressure, especially in the morbidly obese patient.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ultrasound-derived diagnosis of transverse venous sinus stenosis (TVSS) may have a promise given recent exploration of its role in pathophysiology of intracranial hypertension and availability of interventions like venous stenting. We investigated transverse venous sinus (TVS) insonation using transcranial color-coded duplex (TCCD) to establish normative values, inform on inherent physiological variability, and other measures to allow future studies on testing the construct validity of TCCD venous in diagnosing TVSS.

   METHODS: An institutional review board-approved prospective observational study evaluated 20 healthy volunteers to define TCCD-based measures for the TVS. Comparatively, the basal vein of Rosenthal, deep middle cerebral veins, and internal jugular veins were insonated. We report on physiological variability including the intrasubject, intersubject, and side-to-side variability; gradient of TVS velocities on each side from medial to lateral insonation; and the relationship between TVS and other insonated venous structures.

   RESULTS: Fifteen out of 20 subjects had the TVS insonated bilaterally, and five had unilaterally (four right, one left). TVS velocities had comparable intrasubject variability to other intracranial veins insonated and lower velocity-based variability than the pulsatility index. There was significant side-side variability in TVS-derived measures without discernible patterns. Insonating TVS from medial to lateral revealed a gradient with a bimodal peak in ultrasound-derived velocities. We did not find discernible relationships between TVS and other veins for TCCD-derived measures.

   CONCLUSIONS: These results can inform future studies validating the normative values in a larger sample and help explore the role of TCCD venous in the diagnosis of venous sinus stenosis.

Abstract
  Dural sinus malformations (DSMs) are rare congenital vascular diseases characterized by a giant venous pouch with or without arteriovenous shunts. We present a neonatal case of DSM that was diagnosed prenatally and treated via endovascular intervention in the early postnatal period. The patient presented with a large DSM involving the torcular Herophilion prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Enlargement of the head circumference and respiratory failure rapidly progressed after birth. On the 5th day after birth, the neonate underwent endovascular occlusion via the umbilical artery. The arteriovenous shunt was occluded, and the reflux from the enlarged venous pouch to the dural sinus was decreased. No additional procedure other than ventriculoperitoneal shunting was required. The neonate's development slowly caught up to normal parameters. Follow-up MRI demonstrated the successful development of the venous drainage system. DSMs are characterized by an abnormally dilated dural sinus, which can block the venous return and ultimately increase intracranial pressure and cerebral ischemia. Long-term follow-up indicates that an abnormally developed dural sinus can be reconstructed by appropriate and timely treatment. Copyright © 2023.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Acute and chronic hydrocephalus are common pathologies after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Generally, the presence of acute hydrocephalus is associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) treated with a ventricular drain. Subsequently, however, pronounced hydrocephalus without elevated ICP may develop in some patients with SAH in the postacute phase. This is described as acute low-pressure hydrocephalus (aLPH), and there are very limited data in the literature of this pathology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of and factors associated with aLPH and describe its clinical course.

   METHODS: In this retrospective single-center cohort study, the frequency and clinical characteristics of SAH-associated aLPH were investigated. Acute LPH was defined as an increase in ventricular size as measured by the Evans index, ICP within the normal range (< 5 mm Hg) at the time of ventricular enlargement, and timely neurological improvement after indwelling ventricular CSF drainage with negative pressure up to 5 cm H2O below normal level. Demographic and SAH-specific factors in patients with SAH treated using an external ventricular drain were extracted from the electronic medical chart and further analyzed.

   RESULTS: From November 2010 to May 2020, 15 (3.7.%) of 406 patients with SAH fulfilled the criteria for aLPH. Acute LPH was diagnosed after an average of 13.1 +/- 7.7 days. The presence of IVH and its extension were associated with the occurrence of aLPH. After undergoing the transient phase of aLPH, these patients subsequently developed a chronic, typical malresorptive hydrocephalus requiring a ventriculoperitoneal shunt more often (66.7% vs 17.4%, p < 0.001) and stayed longer in the intensive care unit (27 vs 20.5 days, p = 0.043) and in the hospital (36.4 vs 26.3 days, p = 0.004).

   CONCLUSIONS: Acute LPH is a rare pathology in patients with SAH and negatively impacts the clinical course. It should be especially considered in patients with a lack of neurological improvement, an increase in ventricular width, and normal ICP values, so that forced CSF drainage is implemented.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Cerebral venous sinus stenting (VSS) has emerged as a new surgical procedure for the treatment of severe idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), and its popularity has been anecdotally on the rise. This study explores recent temporal trends of VSS and other surgical IIH treatments in the United States.

   METHODS: Adult patients with IIH were identified from the 2016-2020 National Inpatient Sample databases, and surgical procedures and hospital characteristics were recorded. Temporal trends of procedure numbers for VSS, CSF shunts, and optic nerve sheath fenestrations (ONSFs) were assessed and compared.

   RESULTS: A total of 46,065 (95% CI 44,710-47,420) patients with IIH were identified, of whom 7,535 patients (95% CI 6,982-8,088) received surgical IIH treatments. VSS procedures increased 80% (150 [95% CI 55-245] to 270 [95% CI 162-378] per year, p < 0.001). Concurrently, the number of CSF shunts decreased by 19% (1,365 [95% CI 1,126-1,604] to 1,105 [95% CI 900-1,310] per year, p < 0.001), and ONSF procedures decreased by 54% (65 [95% CI 20-110] to 30 [95% CI 6-54] per year, p < 0.001).

   DISCUSSION: Practice patterns for surgical IIH treatment in the United States are rapidly evolving, and VSS is becoming increasingly common. These findings highlight the urgency of randomized controlled trials to investigate the comparative effectiveness and safety of VSS, CSF shunts, ONSF, and standard medical treatments.

Abstract
  The intracranial pressure (ICP) curve with its different peaks has been comprehensively studied, but the exact physiological mechanisms behind its morphology has not been revealed. If the pathophysiology behind deviations from the normal ICP curve form could be identified, it could be vital information to diagnose and treat each single patient. A mathematical model of the hydrodynamics in the intracranial cavity over single heart cycles was developed. A Windkessel model approach was generalized but the unsteady Bernoulli equation was utilized for blood flow and CSF flow. This is a modification of earlier models using the extended and simplified classical Windkessel analogies to a model that is based on mechanisms rooted in the laws of physics. The improved model was calibrated with patient data for cerebral arterial inflow, venous outflow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and ICP over one heart cycle from 10 neuro-intensive care unit patients. A priori model parameter values were obtained by considering patient data and values taken from earlier studies. These values were used as an initial guess for an iterated constrained-ODE (ordinary differential equation) optimization problem with cerebral arterial inflow data as input into the system of ODEs. The optimization routine found patient-specific model parameter values that produced model ICP curves that showed excellent agreement with clinical measurements while model venous and CSF flow were within a physiologically acceptable range. The improved model and the automated optimization routine gave better model calibration results compared to previous studies. Moreover, patient-specific values of physiologically important parameters like intracranial compliance, arterial and venous elastance, and venous outflow resistance were determined. The model was used to simulate intracranial hydrodynamics and to explain the underlying mechanisms of the ICP curve morphology. Sensitivity analysis showed that the order of the three main peaks of the ICP curve was affected by a decrease in arterial elastance, a large increase in resistance to arteriovenous flow, an increase in venous elastance, or a decrease in resistance to CSF flow in the foramen magnum; and the frequency of oscillations were notably affected by intracranial elastance. In particular, certain pathological peak patterns were caused by these changes in physiological parameters. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other mechanism-based models associating the pathological peak patterns to variation of the physiological parameters. Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Based on increased understanding of the idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) pathophysiology, venous sinus stenting (VSS) has emerged as an effective treatment for patients with transverse sinus stenosis (TSS). The presence of a reliable TSS screening tool is warranted. The combined conduit score (CCS) is the most widely used score for evaluation of the cerebral sinovenous stenosis in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography (CE-MRV).

   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the interobserver agreement between neuro-interventionalists and radiologists with respect to the CCS in evaluation of transverse sinus stenosis in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension using CE-MRV.

   METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 26 consecutive patients diagnosed with IIH and underwent CE-MRV. The 2 neuro-interventionalists and 2 radiologists separately evaluated the cerebral venous sinuses using the CCS.

   RESULTS: The mean CCS was significantly different between the neuro-interventionalists and radiologists (p< 0.001), higher for the radiologists. The inter-rater reliability was excellent (ICC= 0.954, 95% CI: 0.898-0.979) between the 2 neuro-interventionalists, good between the 2 radiologists (ICC= 0.805, 95% CI: 0.418-0.921), but was not acceptable between the neuro-interventionalists and the radiologists (ICC 0.47 95% CI:-2.2-0.782).

   CONCLUSION: Despite the excellent agreement between the neuro-interventionists and the good agreement between the radiologists, there was no agreement between the neuro-interventionists and the radiologists. Our finding suggests that there is a gap between the 2 specialties but does not favor any of them. Factors related to the observers, the venous sinus system, the MRV or the CCS score may have resulted in this discrepancy. Automatic or semi-automatic feature extractions to produce quantifiable biomarkers for IIH are warranted. The clinical decisions should not depend only on strongly observer-dependent scores with training and/or experience-dependent influences. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Laxative suppository agent is oftenly used for patient with constipation due to its effectiveness and rapid onset. However, beside the benefit of the drugs, it could cause several side effects which could lead to life-threatening complication. In this report, we present a rare case of laxative's side effect that leads to fatal complication in pediatric patient with history of hydrocephalus and ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt placement.

   CASE REPORT: An 11 years old boy admitted with general weakness, low nutrition intake, and constipation for 4 days. Patient had a history of VP shunt surgery at half months old due to congenital hydrocephalus. Abdominal X-ray found colon dilatation and fecal material collection. Laxative suppository agent was given to the patient. An hour after the treatment, patient had an abdominal pain followed by defecation, and 30 min after defecation, patient was unresponsive with irregular breathing followed by cardiac arrest. Code blue was activated and resuscitation was done for about 40 min, and patient did not respond to resuscitation and pronounced dead 2.5 h after drug's administration.

   DISCUSSION: The pathophysiology of this complication is related with elevated intraabdominal pressure that caused abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), and this condition could lead to several organ dysfunction such as cardiopulmonary and abdominal organ dysfunction inducing central nervous system impairment through raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Pediatric patient with history of hydrocephalus on VP shunt could have a low brain compliance and very susceptible to fatal complication due to acute raised of ICP.

   CONCLUSION: Laxative suppository agent on pediatric patient with hydrocephalus on VP shunt could lead to fatal complication through ACS and acute elevated ICP pressure. Oral laxative agent should be chosen in constipated patient with neurologic preexisting condition, and patient should be closely monitored if suppository agent is given. Copyright © 2023.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) patients with new-onset headache and to identify the risk factors for headache in this population.

   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the demographic and clinical data of 69 CVT patients recruited between September 2017 and September 2019. Patients were classified into two groups, the headache group and the non-headache group, according to the presence or absence of new-onset headache symptoms at admission. The following characteristics and parameters were measured and analyzed, including gender, age, amount of thromboembolic cerebral venous sinus(ATCVS), and other relevant indicators.

   RESULTS: The incidence of headache was 75% in this cohort. The proportion of female patients in the headache group was higher than that in the non-headache group. Patients in the headache group were younger than those without headache. CVT patients of headache group showed higher lymphocyte ratio (LR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and intracranial pressure (ICP) compared to the non-headache group, whereas mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and levels of protein (cerebrospinal fluid, CSF) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) in CSF were lower in headache patients. The data also revealed younger age and the increased level of chloride ion CI-(CSF) were the risk factors for the occurrence of headache in CVT patients.

   CONCLUSION: Age, LR, MCV, BUN levels, ICP, protein (CSF), and LDH (CSF) in patients with headache were significantly different from those in the non-headache group at admission. Younger age and a level of CI- (CSF) were risk factors for headache in CVT patients. These findings may provide guidance for clinical diagnosis and treatment of CVT. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

Abstract
  The alteration of the hydrostatic pressure gradient in the human body has been associated with changes in human physiology, including abnormal blood flow, syncope, and visual impairment. The focus of this study was to evaluate changes in the resonant frequency of a wearable electromagnetic resonant skin patch sensor during simulated physiological changes observed in aerospace applications. Simulated microgravity was induced in eight healthy human participants (n = 8), and the implementation of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) countermeasures was induced in four healthy human participants (n = 4). The average shift in resonant frequency was -13.76 +/- 6.49 MHz for simulated microgravity with a shift in intracranial pressure (ICP) of 9.53 +/- 1.32 mmHg, and a shift of 8.80 +/- 5.2097 MHz for LBNP with a shift in ICP of approximately -5.83 +/- 2.76 mmHg. The constructed regression model to explain the variance in shifts in ICP using the shifts in resonant frequency (R2 = 0.97) resulted in a root mean square error of 1.24. This work demonstrates a strong correlation between sensor signal response and shifts in ICP. Furthermore, this study establishes a foundation for future work integrating wearable sensors with alert systems and countermeasure recommendations for pilots and astronauts.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Childhood hydrocephalus patients treated by ventriculo-peritoneal (v.-p.) shunting are sometimes referred years after this therapy for evaluation of suspicious pituitary enlargement. Since pituitary size has been shown to depend on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, we assume this phenomenon to be caused by shunt overdrainage. Therefore, we studied pituitary size and morphology in shunted hydrocephalus patients with radiological signs of high CSF drainage.

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of pituitary size and morphology in 15 shunted patients with non-tumoral hydrocephalus and 7 shunted hydrocephalus patients due to childhood brain tumor compared to a population mean. In five brain tumor patients also pre- and postsurgical comparisons were performed.

   RESULTS: Pituitary mid-sagittal size and pituitary volume were significantly higher in both hydrocephalus groups, compared to the population mean (midsagittal size t = 5.91; p < 0.001; pituitary volume, t = 3.03; p = 0.006). In patients available for pre- and postoperative comparison, there was also a significant increase in pituitary size and volume postoperatively (mean preoperative midsagittal height 2.54 +/- 1.0 mm vs. 6.6 +/- 0.7 mm post-surgery; mean pre-operative pituitary volume 120.5 +/- 69.2 mm3 vs. 368.9 +/- 57.9 mm3 post-surgery).

   CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed a significant increase in pituitary size and volume, mimicking pituitary pathology, after v.-p. shunt insertion. This phenomenon can be explained by the Monro-Kellie doctrine, stating that intracranial depletion of CSF-as caused by v.p. shunting-leads to compensatory intracranial hyperemia, especially in the venous system, with the consequence of engorged venous sinuses, most likely responsible for enlargement of the pituitary gland.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) without any identifiable cause. However, restrictions of cerebrospinal fluid absorption from the cerebral venous system, the glymphatic system overflow, and the cerebrospinal fluid's lymphatic pathways may be involved in the pathophysiology of IIH. Furthermore, an impaired glymphatic system is also implicated in the initiation and progression of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Here, we reported a case of CSVD with concomitant IIH, possibly associated with the brain's glymphatic and lymphatic system dysfunction.

   CASE CONCERN: A 39-year-old male presented with worsening headaches over the bilateral parietal areas during the past year and nausea for 2 days. Fundus examination revealed bilateral papilledema and lumbar puncture suggestive of elevated ICP, laboratory results showed hyperhomocysteinemia and mutation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T. On magnetic resonance imaging, subcortical small infarct, white matter lesions, lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces and dilatation of the optic nerve sheaths was detected, and right transverse sinus stenosis and a hypoplastic left sinus were showed on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography.

   DIAGNOSIS: The diagnoses of IIH, CSVD, transverse sinus stenosis, and hyperhomocysteinemia were performed.

   INTERVISION AND OUTCOMES: The patient received antihypertensive, antiplatelet, anti-atherosclerotic, and homocysteine-lowering therapies. Finally, the patient's symptoms remised, and the increased ICP returned to normal; however, the bilateral TSS persisted after 3 months of follow-up.

   CONCLUSIONS: In this case, we speculate that the normal glymphatic outflow pathway may serve as a compensatory mechanism for regulating increased ICP in patients with bilateral venous sinus obstruction, indicating impaired venous outflow pathway, possibly associated with dysfunction of the glymphatic and lymphatic systems in patients with CSVD.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore a non-invasive estimate of pressure drop in patients who undergo venous sinus stenting to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

   METHODS: This prospective study included 28 IIH patients scheduled for venous stenting. 4D-flow MRI was acquired 24-48 h before venous manometry. Manometry-obtained pressure drop (Mp) was dichotomized into low (Lp: 0-8 mmHg) and high (Hp: 8-30 mmHg) groups. Hemodynamic indices were compared between Lp and Hp. Trans-stenotic pressure drop was estimated by work-energy equation, simplified Bernoulli equation, vorticity magnitude, and velocity difference between inlet and outlet and was compared with Mp. Measurement agreement, correlation, and accuracy were evaluated using the kappa coefficient, Pearson's r, and confusion matrix-derived accuracy.

   RESULTS: Among 28 patients (mean age 38.8 +/- 12.7), 19 (67.9%) were female. Work-energy equation-estimated pressure drop (WEp) had strong correlation (r = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-0.96, p < 0.001) and high agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78-0.95, p < 0.001) with Mp. WEp classified Lp and Hp with an accuracy of 0.96. The kappa value between WEp and Mp was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.78-1.00). In the work-energy equation, the viscosity energy term (Ve) had the largest weights, and the ratio of Ve to the summation of the three energy terms was 0.93 +/- 0.07. Ve had strong correlation with mVort (r = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.85-0.97, p < 0.001), and mean vorticity magnitude was significantly elevated in Hp compared to that in Lp (259.8 vs. 174.9 mL/s, p < 0.001).

   CONCLUSION: Trans-stenotic pressure drop in IIH can be estimated using the work-energy equation with favorable accuracy.

   KEY POINTS: * Trans-stenotic pressure drop in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension can be estimated accurately with the work-energy equation using the 4D-flow MRI full velocity field. * Compared with traditional venous sinus manometry, the 4D-flow MRI-derived pressure drop is totally non-invasive and cost-saving. * 4D-flow MRI may help neurointerventionalist to select IIH patients suitable for venous sinus stenting.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Venous sinus manometry performed by microcatheter to assess candidacy for venous sinus stenting in patients with idiopathic cranial pressure (IIH) can be tiring, time-consuming and unreliable. Pressure wire is widely used to measure coronary pressure and evaluate coronary stenosis severity, but venous sinus manometry using the pressure guide wire has only been reported in one case, and few studies have examined the accuracy of this approach.

   OBJECTIVE: To compare venous manometry performed by microcatheter with by pressure wire under awake setting in patients with IIH.

   METHODS: The manometry results of 30 patients with IIH were recorded by Rebar-27 microcatheter and a pressure wire under awake setting. The mean venous pressures (MVPs) and trans-stenosis pressure gradients were obtained and compared between microcatheter and pressure wire. Paired t-test) were used to evaluate the data between the two groups.

   RESULTS: MVPs in superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and torcula were slightly higher with microcatheter, though without statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). MVPs in transverse sinus (TS) and sigmoid sinus (SS) were significantly higher with microcatheter (p < 0.05). Trans-stenotic pressure gradient with microcatheter was significantly higher than with pressure wire (p<0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial venous pressure measured with the microcatheter and pressure wire showed a moderate difference. Compared with the traditional microcatheter method,the pressure wire is safe, fast and effective method to identify the patient needing intervention.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Venous sinus stenosis (VSS) stenting has emerged as an effective treatment for patients with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH). However, stenting carries risk of in-stent stenosis/thrombosis and cumulative bleeding risk from long-term dual antiplatelet (DAPT) use. Thus, we investigated the potential safety and efficacy of primary balloon angioplasty as an alternative to stenting in IIH.

   METHODS: A prospectively maintained single-center registry of IIH patients undergoing endovascular procedures was queried. Inclusion criteria included patients with confirmed IIH and angiographically demonstrable VSS who underwent interventions from 2012- 2021. Patients were dichotomized into primary balloon angioplasty (Group A) and primary stenting (Group S), comparing clinical outcomes using bivariate analyses.

   RESULTS: 62 patients were included with median age of 33 [IQR 26-37], 74% females. Group A (9/62) and Group S (53/62) had similar baseline characteristics. Papilledema improvement was higher in Group S at 6 weeks and 6 months (44 vs. 93, p = 0.002 and 44 vs. 92%, p = 0.004), with similar improvements across all symptoms. Group S had higher mean post-procedure venous pressure gradient change (8 vs. 3 mmHg, p = 0.02) and a lower CSF opening pressure at 6 months (23 vs. 36 cmH2O, p < 0.001). VPS rescue rate was higher in Group A (44 vs. 2%, p = 0.001). There was only one procedural complications; a subdural hematoma in Group A.

   CONCLUSIONS: Primary VSS balloon angioplasty provides a marginal and short-lived improvement of IIH symptoms compared to stenting. These findings suggest a cautious and limited role for short-term rescue angioplasty in poor shunting and stenting candidates with refractory IIH.

Abstract
  The Corona virus infection started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan - China and spread rapidly throughout the world, generating the Covid 19 pandemic. The manifestations of the Covid disease were extremely varied, from a simple flu, with fever, cough, weakness, headache, joint pain, up to severe pneumonia, with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov2) and even death. The symptomatology of the disease, the evolution and the complications that appeared varied, depending on the associated pathology - diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), the age and the immune status of the patient. Aim: The ocular manifestations related to Covid 19 were mostly represented by conjunctivitis, but the neurotropic character of Corona virus could justify the appearance of certain neuro-ophthalmological manifestations, such as: optic neuritis (ON), cranial nerve palsies, visual field (VF) anomalies. The aim of this paper was to research the cases of optic neuropathy post-Covid 19, published in the specialty literature between 2020 and 2022. The following were evaluated: risk factors, distribution by age group and gender, evolution and complications, as well as the clinical forms of optic neuropathies. Materials and methods: We used Google Scholar and PubMed databases to find articles on optic neuropathies related to the Covid-19 infection. We followed the articles published during the pandemic and selected 21 cases, belonging to 17 authors, irrespective of their origin and the language in which they were written. Results: 21 patients affected by ON in the Covid-19 disease, 11 women and 10 men, were mentioned. The optic neuropathies described by the authors were: retrobulbar optic neuropathy, only one associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), papillitis, neuroretinitis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), out of which one arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION) and the others non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAAION), one being related to pronation in an oro-tracheal intubated (OTI) patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Discussions: The neuro-ophthalmological complications associated with Covid 19 disease can be severe, so the patients should be monitored continuously. Many investigations (serological, immunological and imaging exams) are necessary to exclude other etiologies of ON. Conclusions: A complete ophthalmological exam is mandatory for each patient diagnosed with Covid 19 disease, even if they have ocular manifestations or not.

Abstract
  Clinical features include visual disturbances, headaches, and pulsatile tinnitus that can be associated with reduced quality of life, and a risk of irreversible visual impairment in some cases. Obese women of childbearing age represent the main at-risk population, and the incidence of the disease is increasing because of rising prevalence of obesity worldwide. In addition, an imbalance in sex hormones is reported as a contributing risk factor. The pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension involves a disturbance of the evacuation pathway of intracranial fluids caused by the increase in intracranial venous pressure. Brain imaging is useful for diagnosis with several signs including bilateral stenosis of the transverse sinuses that plays a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease by creating a positive feedback loop that increases intracranial venous hypertension and contributes to clinical manifestations. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent permanent visual impairment. Drug therapies including acetazolamide and topiramate have moderate effectiveness. Among invasive treatments, transverse sinus stenting seems to be the most interesting option to consider in drug-resistant patients. Weight loss remains essential to achieve a sustainable improvement by reducing central venous pressure. Future randomized trials are expected to reach a consensus on this treatment.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is frequently treated with venous sinus stenosis stenting with high success rates. Patient selection has been driven almost exclusively by identification of supraphysiological venous pressure gradients across stenotic regions based on theoretical assessment of likelihood of response.

   OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility of benefit in low venous pressure gradient patients.

   METHODS: Using a single-center, prospectively maintained registry of patients with IIH undergoing venous stenting, we defined treatment groups by gradient pressures of <=4, 5 to 8, and >8 mmHg based on the most frequently previously published thresholds for stenting. Baseline demographics, clinical, and neuro-ophthalmological outcomes (including optical coherence tomography and Humphrey visual fields) were compared.

   RESULTS: Among 53 patients, the mean age was 32 years and 70% female with a mean body mass index was 36 kg/m 2 . Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The mean change in lumbar puncture opening pressure at 6 months poststenting was similar between the 3 groups (<=4, 5-8, and >8 mmHg; 13.4, 12.9, and 12.4 cmH 2 O, P = .47). Papilledema improvement was observed across groups at 6 months (100, 93, and 86, P = .7) as were all clinical symptoms. The mean changes in optical coherence tomography retinal nerve fiber layer (-30, -54, and -104, P = .5) and mean deviation in Humphrey visual fields (60, 64, and 67, P = .5) at 6 weeks were not significantly different.

   CONCLUSION: Patients with IH with low venous pressure gradient venous sinus stenosis seem to benefit equally from venous stenting compared with their higher gradient counterparts. Re-evaluation of our restrictive criteria for this potentially vision sparing intervention is warranted. Future prospective confirmatory studies are needed.

Abstract
  Weightlessness induces a cephalad shift of blood and cerebrospinal fluid that may increase intracranial pressure (ICP) during spaceflight, whereas lower body negative pressure (LBNP) may provide an opportunity to caudally redistribute fluids and lower ICP. To investigate the effects of spaceflight and LBNP on noninvasive indicators of ICP (nICP), we studied 13 crewmembers before and after spaceflight in seated, supine, and 15degree head-down tilt postures, and at ~45 and ~150 days of spaceflight with and without 25 mmHg LBNP. We used four techniques to quantify nICP: cerebral and cochlear fluid pressure (CCFP), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), ultrasound measures of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), and ultrasound-based internal jugular vein pressure (IJVp). On flight day 45, two nICP measures were lower than preflight supine posture [CCFP: mean difference -98.5 -nL (CI: -190.8 to -6.1 -nL), P = 0.037]; [OAE: -19.7degree (CI: -10.4degree to -29.1degree), P < 0.001], but not significantly different from preflight seated measures. Conversely, ONSD was not different than any preflight posture, whereas IJVp was significantly greater than preflight seated measures [14.3 mmHg (CI: 10.1 to 18.5 mmHg), P < 0.001], but not significantly different than preflight supine measures. During spaceflight, acute LBNP application did not cause a significant change in nICP indicators. These data suggest that during spaceflight, nICP is not elevated above values observed in the seated posture on Earth. Invasive measures would be needed to provide absolute ICP values and more precise indications of ICP change during various phases of spaceflight. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The current study provides new evidence that intracranial pressure (ICP), as assessed with noninvasive measures, may not be elevated during long-duration spaceflight. In addition, the acute use of lower body negative pressure did not significantly reduce indicators of ICP during weightlessness.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to define the level of peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and mean airway pressure ([Formula: see text]) at which a pneumothorax is produced in an in vivo ARDS neonate model. In addition, we analyzed the hemodynamic response and cerebral parameters during the progressive increase of intrathoracic pressure.

   METHODS: We designed a prospective, experimental study with 11 Landrace x Large White pigs < 48 h from their birth. With the pigs under general anesthesia, tracheal intubation, invasive hemodynamic monitoring with a pediatric arterial thermodilution catheter, intracranial pressure, cerebral oximetry through near-infrared spectroscopy, and bilateral chest tube catheterization were performed. The ARDS model was developed with bronchoalveolar lavages. The rise in inspiratory pressure was performed achieved by increasing PEEP in stepwise increments at a constant driving pressure. PEEP was increased 5 cm H2O every 2 min until a pneumothorax was observed. A descriptive analysis, a Kaplan-Meier curve, and a regression analysis by using a generalized estimation equation were performed.

   RESULTS: A pneumothorax was observed in a median (interquartile range [IQR]) [Formula: see text] of 54 (46-56) cm H2O and median (IQR) PIP of 65 (58-73) cm H2O; asystole at median (IQR) [Formula: see text] of 49 (36-54) cm H2O and median (IQR) PIP of 60 (48-65) cm H2O. Hemodynamic changes in the median artery pressure, cardiac output, and myocardial contractility were observed above the range of [Formula: see text] of 14 cm H2O (PIP 25 and PEEP 10 cm H2O). Disturbances in intracranial pressure and cerebral oximetry through near-infrared spectroscopy appeared when deep hypotension and asystole occurred.

   CONCLUSIONS: A progressive increase of PEEP at a constant driving pressure did not increase severe adverse events at the range of pressures that we routinely use in neonates with ARDS. Asystole, pneumothorax, and cerebral compromise appeared at high intrathoracic ranges of pressure. Hemodynamics must be strictly monitored in all patients during the performance of lung recruitment maneuvers because hemodynamic deflections emerge early, at a range of pressures commonly used in ventilated neonates with ARDS.

Abstract
  Cognitive dysfunction is often multifaceted and can be seen across all age groups in medicine. The combination of cognitive decline and increased intracranial pressure may suggest possible anatomical abnormalities. We present a case report from our academic center that describes a young man with new cognitive fatigue and brain fog in the setting of increased venous pressure that resolved with surgical intervention at a site of jugular vein stenosis. We discuss current hypotheses from basic and clinical research related to pathophysiology underlying venous vascular congestion and associated neurologic disorders. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of venous congestion and cognition to better identify therapies and improve quality of life for patients.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is an uncommon cerebrovascular disease with diverse predisposing factors. We report a case of CVST caused by a thyroid storm induced by traumatic brain injury.

   CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old male patient with a history of Graves' disease with hyperthyroidism presented to our hospital with head trauma of cerebral contusion and laceration in both frontal lobes confirmed by admission CT scan. He received mannitol to lower intracranial pressure, haemostatic therapy, and antiepileptic treatment. Eight days later, he presented with signs of thyroid storms, such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, sweating and irritation, and his thyroid function tests revealed high levels of TPO-Ab, TR-Ab, TG-Ab, FT3 and FT4. Then, he entered a deep coma. His brain CT showed a thrombosis of multiple venous sinuses, along with the opening of peripheral collateral vessels, congestive infarction with haemorrhage and brain swelling. He regained consciousness after treatment with antithyroid drugs, anticoagulants, respiratory support and a regimen of sedation/analgesia. After a half-year follow-up, most of the patient's blocked cerebral venous sinuses had been recanalized, but there were still some sequelae, such as an impaired fine motor performance of the right hand and verbal expression defects.

   CONCLUSIONS: CVST can be induced by thyroid storms, and trauma-related thyroid storms can develop on the basis of hyperthyroidism. The purpose of this case report is to raise clinicians' awareness and improve their ability to diagnose CVST early in patients with traumatic brain injury complicating thyroid storms to improve the neurological prognosis among similar patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a clinical syndrome characterised by raised intracranial pressure with no discernible aetiology. It is relatively rare in children and its demographic features may differ from those of adults. The relationship between IIH and venous sinus stenosis (VSS) is well known. As VSS plays an important role in the pathophysiology, treatments have been developed aimed at improving venous blood outflow in refractory IIH. In the last two decades, venous sinus stenting has emerged as a treatment option in cases where stenosis is documented.

   METHODS AND RESULTS: The scientific literature on paediatric cases of IIH and its treatment with venous sinus stenting was analysed. We present the case of a 6-year-old girl with a life-threatening presentation of IIH, who was treated with transverse sinus stenting and a lumboperitoneal shunt. We summarise the characteristic of paediatric stenting cases reported and review the literature focusing on the main aspects of venous sinus stenting.

   CONCLUSION: VSS stenting could be a treatment tool for the acute presentation of IIH with severe symptoms and VSS plus an elevated trans-stenotic pressure gradient. However, in some cases, additional surgical treatment may be necessary. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Increased intraabdominal pressure, termed intraabdominal hypertension (IAH), is reported as an independent cause of morbidity and mortality in the human ICU but, until recently, has been rarely described in veterinary species outside of experimental models. Failure to identify severe IAH leads to organ dysfunction, termed abdominal compartment syndrome, and rapidly becomes fatal without therapeutic intervention. Although the veterinary community has been slow to address the concept of IAH and associated comorbidities, recent companion and large animal case series and experimental studies suggest IAH may also be common in veterinary species and correlates well with risk factors and grading systems already described in the human literature.

   PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Increasing abdominal pressures exert deleterious local effects through visceral ischemia and reperfusion injury as well as systemic effects on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and central nervous systems. Even mild grades of IAH increase systemic vascular resistance, impede venous return, increase pulmonary wedge pressure, and decrease pulmonary function. More severe grades cause azotemia, oliguria, decreased coronary blood flow, hypoxia, increased intracranial pressure, and death.

   IMPORTANCE: Many of the common diseases in veterinary patients are associated with IAH, including gastric dilatation-volvulus, colon volvulus, closed pyometra, hemoperitoneum, ascites, uroperitoneum, and hydrops. Monitoring of the veterinary patient is difficult, but several experimental studies validate both the presence of IAH and the ability to monitor abdominal pressures in large and small animal species. Moreover, prompt recognition of IAH and subsequent treatment is feasible in the veterinary ICU.

   KEY POINTS: Increasing abdominal pressures exert deleterious local effects through visceral ischemia and reperfusion injury as well as systemic effects on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and central nervous systems. Increases in central venous pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary wedge pressure, and a decreased cardiac output by way of both decreased preload and increased afterload have been documented as a result of intraabdominal hypertension (IAH). Direct diagnosis of IAH is achieved by blind or ultrasound-guided abdominal needle puncture attached to awatermanometeror direct pressure monitoring transducer. Transvesicular measurement of intraabdominal pressure (IAP) is relatively noninvasive, and many patients that would benefit from rapid diagnosis of IAH and abdominal compartment syndrome already have indwelling bladder catheters. Recommendations for interventions are based on the assigned grade of IAH (mild, moderate, severe).

   KEY POINTS: If IAH is strongly suspected or diagnosed, abdominal wall compliance may be improved through judicious use of neuromuscular blockers and sedation. Decompression, either minimally invasive or surgical, is absolutely recommended for IAPs consistently above 20 mm Hg, especially in the presence of signs attributed to secondary organ dysfunction.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: The treatment of hydrocephalus has been a topic of intense research ever since the first clinically successful use of a valved cerebrospinal fluid shunt 72 years ago. While ample studies elucidating different phenomena impacting this treatment exist, there are still gaps to be filled. Specifically, how intracranial, intrathecal, arterial, and venous pressures react and communicate with each other simultaneously.

   METHODS: An in-vivo sheep trial (n = 6) was conducted to evaluate and quantify the communication existing within the cranio-spinal, arterial, and venous systems (1 kHz sampling frequency). Standardized intrathecal infusion testing was performed using an automated infusion apparatus, including bolus and constant pressure infusions. Bolus infusions entailed six lumbar intrathecal infusions of 2 mL Ringer's solution. Constant pressure infusions were comprised of six regulated pressure steps of 3.75 mmHg for periods of 7 min each. Mean pressure reactions, pulse amplitude reactions, and outflow resistance were calculated.

   RESULTS: All sheep showed intracranial pressure reactions to acute increases of intrathecal pressure, with four of six sheep showing clear cranio-spinal communication. During bolus infusions, the increases of mean pressure for intrathecal, intracranial, arterial, and venous pressure were 16.6 +/- 0.9, 15.4 +/- 0.8, 3.9 +/- 0.8, and 0.1 +/- 0.2 mmHg with corresponding pulse amplitude increases of 2.4 +/- 0.3, 1.3 +/- 0.3, 1.3 +/- 0.3, and 0.2 +/- 0.1 mmHg, respectively. During constant pressure infusions, mean increases from baseline were 14.6 +/- 3.8, 15.5 +/- 4.2, 4.2 +/- 8.2, and 3.2 +/- 2.4 mmHg with the corresponding pulse amplitude increases of 2.5 +/- 3.6, 2.5 +/- 3.0, 7.7 +/- 4.3, and 0.7 +/- 2.0 mmHg for intrathecal, intracranial, arterial, and venous pulse amplitude, respectively. Outflow resistances were calculated as 51.6 +/- 7.8 and 77.8 +/- 14.5 mmHg/mL/min for the bolus and constant pressure infusion methods, respectively-showing deviations between the two estimation methods.

   CONCLUSIONS: Standardized infusion tests with multi-compartmental pressure recordings in sheep have helped capture distinct reactions between the intrathecal, intracranial, arterial, and venous systems. Volumetric pressure changes in the intrathecal space have been shown to propagate to the intraventricular and arterial systems in our sample, and to the venous side in individual cases. These results represent an important step into achieving a more complete quantitative understanding of how an acute rise in intrathecal pressure can propagate and influence other systems.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by increased intracranial pressure, manifested by papilledema and radiological findings, in the absence of an identifiable casual factor. The primary symptoms include headache, vision loss, and pulsatile tinnitus, and are recognized to have profound impacts on quality of life and visual function. IIH demonstrates a strong predilection towards obese women of reproductive age, and the population incidence is rising with the growing prevalence of obesity worldwide. The pathophysiology involves dysregulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics and venous sinus pressure, and recent studies highlighting the pathogenic role of metabolic and hormonal factors have led to the identification of several pharmacological targets and development of novel therapeutic agents. The overarching treatment goals include symptomatic alleviation and prevention of permanent vision loss. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial, the first of its kind randomized controlled trial on IIH, provides class I evidence for treatment with weight loss and acetazolamide. In medically refractive or fulminant cases, optic nerve sheath fenestration, CSF diversion, and venous sinus stenting, have been successfully implemented. However, there are few high-quality prospective studies investigating the treatment and natural history of IIH, highlighting the compelling need for further research to determine the optimal treatment regimen.

Abstract
  IMPORTANCE: Astronauts returning from long-duration spaceflight experience ocular remodeling related to cephalad fluid shifts induced by microgravity. It is hypothesized that the absence of diurnal reductions in intracranial pressure in microgravity creates a low but persistent pressure gradient at the posterior aspect of the eye, which results in ocular remodeling and space-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) over many months.

   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether partial reintroduction of footward fluid shifts during simulated microgravity via lower body negative pressure (LBNP) during sleep attenuates choroid engorgement, an early marker of ocular remodeling related to SANS.

   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between May 2019 and February 2020, participants with no major cardiovascular, kidney, or ophthalmic disease completed 3 days of supine (0degree) bed rest with and 3 days without 8 hours of nightly LBNP in a randomized, crossover design. This single-center investigation took place at the UT Southwestern Medical Center. All analyses were conducted blinded to condition and time point.

   INTERVENTIONS: Eight hours of nightly LBNP (-20 mm Hg) vs no LBNP.

   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in choroid area and volume after 3 days of bed rest measured by optical coherence tomography.

   RESULTS: Of 10 participants, 5 were female, the mean (SD) age was 29 (9) years, and the age range was 18 to 55 years. Central venous pressure increased from the seated to supine position (mean [SD], seated: -2.3 [2.0] vs supine: 6.9 [2.0] mm Hg; P < .001), leading to choroid engorgement over 3 days of bed rest (DELTA area: +0.09 mm2 [95% CI, 0.04-0.13]; P = .001; DELTA volume: +0.37 mm3 [95% CI, 0.19-0.55]; P = .001). Nightly LBNP caused a sustained reduction in supine central venous pressure (mean [SD], 5.7 [2.2] mm Hg to 1.2 [1.4 mm Hg]; P < .001) and attenuated the increase in choroid area (74%) (DELTA: 0.02 mm2 [95% -0.02 to 0.06]; P = .01) and volume (53%) (DELTA: 0.17 mm3 [95% CI, 0.01-0.34]; P = .05) compared with control.

   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Nightly LBNP reinstated a footward fluid shift and mitigated the increase in choroid area and volume. LBNP during sleep may be an effective countermeasure for ocular remodeling and SANS during long-duration space missions.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is the most common manifestation of vasculo-Behcet's disease and may be superficial and/or deep localization. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological features of CVT associated with Behcet's disease in our population and to compare findings with previous studies.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a retrospective study of 24 cases of CVT secondary to Behcet's disease, collected between 1999 and 2019 in the neurology department of the Mohamed V Military Hospital (Rabat), the Avicenne Military Hospital (Marrakech) and the Mohamed VI Hospital (Marrakech). The diagnosis of Behcet's disease was made in all cases according to the 2014 International Study Group Criteria for Behcet diseases. Patients received antithrombotic treatment, combined with corticosteroids, in six cases of superficial CVT and with immunosuppressants in cases of deep CVT.

   RESULTS: Clinical manifestations were dominated by motor deficit in deep localizations and intracranial hypertension in superficial locations. The diencephalic-mesencephalic syndrome was found in 18 patients, whereas intracranial hypertension (71%) and headache (57%) were the most common presentations of superficial CVT. Unlike previous studies, magnetic resonance angiography and conventional angiography performed in our patients confirmed the predominance of deep venous thrombosis (18 cases), whereas superficial CVT was observed only in six cases.

   DISCUSSION: In our series, the benefit of conventional angiography was undeniable, by confirming the diagnosis of basal vein of Rosenthal thrombosis in 75% of our patients. Short-term outcome was favorable, but sequelae of CVT were noted in 20 patients (75%). The outcome of patients was commonly mRS 02, however 70% of patients presenting with deep CVT at the beginning had a poor outcome (mRS 03) and we did not record any case of venous thrombosis relapse.

Abstract
  Hydrocephalus induced by low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure is extremely rare and sporadically reported. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, head trauma, and spinal drainage were reported to be causative factors for surgical treatment. A 33-year-old man with subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by right vertebral artery aneurysm rupture developed headache. Trapping surgery was performed, and a spinal drain was inserted from L4/5 for subarachnoid hemorrhage washout. On postoperative day 3, subdural fluid accumulation had increased at the posterior fossa craniotomy site and the cerebellar sulci had narrowed; the ventricles were slightly enlarged. The patient reported headache during head elevation. Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) was suspected. After the spinal drain was removed, headache resolved, and cerebral ventriculomegaly disappeared. The subsequent clinical course was good. The patient was discharged 3 weeks after surgery. LPH is a rare disease caused by various factors and is treated by correcting liquorrhea or overdrainage, when present. Otherwise, drainage at negative CSF pressure is necessary. The symptoms and image findings for LPH are similar to those for intracranial hypertension and normal-pressure hydrocephalus. This report describes a suspected case of LPH caused by spinal drainage after subarachnoid hemorrhage and reviews the literature.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: While venous congestion in the peripheral vasculature has been described and accepted, intracranial venous congestion remains poorly understood. The characteristics, pathophysiology, and management of cerebral venous stasis, venous hypertension and venous congestion remain controversial, and a unifying conceptual schema is absent. The cerebral venous and lymphatic systems are part of a complex and dynamic interaction between the intracranial compartments, with interplay between the parenchyma, veins, arteries, cerebrospinal fluid, and recently characterized lymphatic-like systems in the brain. Each component contributes towards intracranial pressure, occupying space within the fixed calvarial volume. This article proposes a framework to consider conditions resulting in brain and neck venous congestion, and seeks to expedite further study of cerebral venous diagnoses, mechanisms, symptomatology, and treatments.

   METHODS: A multi-institution retrospective review was performed to identify unique patient cases, complemented with a published case series to assess a spectrum of disease states with components of venous congestion affecting the brain. These diseases were organized according to anatomical location and purported mechanisms. Outcomes of treatments were also analyzed. Illustrative cases were identified in the venous treatment databases of the authors.

   CONCLUSION: This framework is the first clinically structured description of venous pathologies resulting in intracranial venous and cerebrospinal fluid hypertension. Our proposed system highlights unique clinical symptoms and features critical for appropriate diagnostic work-up and potential treatment. This novel schema allows clinicians effectively to approach cases of intracranial hypertension secondary to venous etiologies, and furthermore provides a framework by which researchers can better understand this developing area of cerebrovascular disease.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous outflow obstruction involves idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and the most common related condition is dural venous sinus stenosis or, in other words, an obstruction of the dural venous sinuses. In these cases, the pathological process is often chronic, displays only mild symptoms, and rarely requires urgent surgical intervention. In this study, we present a unique case involving an acute cerebral venous outflow obstruction that occurred during meningioma resection that ultimately had catastrophic consequences.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient's preoperative imaging only revealed an unremarkable frontal convexity meningioma with an average diameter exceeding 8 cm. She was admitted for a scheduled right frontoparietal craniotomy for lesion resection.

   RESULTS: The patient's unique congenital dural venous sinus structure along with a non-surgical epidural hematoma both contributed to a catastrophic outcome, causing a progressive hemispheric encephalocele, significant blood loss, and wound closure difficulties.

   CONCLUSION: Neurosurgeons should place an additional focus on cerebral venous outflow patency during tumor resection, even if the tumor does not involve the transverse or sigmoid sinuses. It is well known that the tacking sutures play an essential role in preventing an epidural hematoma, but the procedure to mitigate hematomas occurring outside the surgical field of view is not fully recognized by neurosurgeons. If dural tacking sutures are placed after complete tumor resection, the prophylactic effect for preventing EDH in the non-surgical areas may not be guaranteed. Therefore, we strongly advocate for the tacking sutures to be accurately placed before dural incisions are made.

Abstract
  We report three patients who deteriorated after lumbar puncture (LP). Two patients were later found to have type ii (a + b) dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF) with high flow retrograde venous drainage on cerebral angiography. The third had a type II (a) DAVF. All patients recovered at least partially after DAVF treatment. In patients with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) but no evidence of focal mass lesion on cranial imaging, we suggest an evaluation for a DAVF before performing an LP.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In brain injury patients, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may potentially increase the intracranial pressure (ICP). ICP can be noninvasively assessed from the sonographic measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). Herein, we aim to evaluate the association between PEEP and ICP via measuring ONSD in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.

   METHODS: TBI patients with age >=18 years, severe brain injury (GCS 8 or less), receiving mechanical ventilation, initial PEEP <=4 mmHg and no history of severe cardiopulmonary disease were included in this study. Patients with intracranial hypertension (defined as ICP >20 mmHg) and already receiving PEEP >15 cm H2O at enrollment were excluded from the study. ONSD measurement was performed when hemodynamic parameters were most stable. Variables included central venous pressure, invasive blood pressure, heart rate, saturation, and ventilator parameters.

   RESULTS: The ONSD and ICP did not increase significantly while PEEP increased from 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm H2O. However, ONSD and ICP significantly increased when PEEP increased from 10-15 cm H2O. There was no significant difference noted while comparing measurements of optic nerve sheath (ONS) diameter in both eyes at all PEEP values in cases as well as control patients. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased with an increase in PEEP value. Highly significant decrease occurred in MAP change from PEEP 10-15 in cases (P < 0.001) and control (P < 0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: The PEEP up to 10 cm H2O can be safely applied in patients with TBI. In addition, the increment of PEEP might further increase the oxygenation, at the cost of ICP accentuation.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The Cushing reflex does not appear to have been described in preterm neonates. This case report shows the presence of an active Cushing reflex in a 32-week preterm neonate with hyaline membrane disease.

   CASE PRESENTATION: The 1.94 kg Caucasian infant was delivered by caesarean section following concerns about possible maternal infection and fetal compromise. Chest X-ray showed mild-to-moderate hyaline membrane disease and treatment was initiated with supplemental oxygen and nasal continuous positive airway pressure. It is probable that a pneumothorax occurred at 5-6 hours of age, with progression during the day. Interstitial air, pneumomediastinum, and tension pneumothorax were diagnosed on subsequent X-ray, and ultrasound of the brain showed a grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage. A review of the nurses' recordings of heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate showed a progressive increase in blood pressure accompanied by slowing of the heart rate and irregular respiration. These are features of the Cushing reflex that is elicited in response to raised intracranial pressure.

   CONCLUSION: While well-described in older children and adults, in neonates the Cushing reflex has mainly been described in animal experiments and infants who have developed hydrocephalus. It is likely that in this case, the reflex was elicited as a result of a progressive increase in intracranial pressure due to the combination of elevated intrathoracic pressure, obstructed venous return from the brain, and concurrent intraventricular hemorrhage.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Pediatric vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs) are fistulous intracranial malformations arising congenitally within the choroidal fissure that can present with an array of neurological and cardiac sequelae. Associated venous stenosis may result in intracranial venous hypertension and ischemia leading to severe, irreversible cerebral injury. Management of neonatal VOGMs typically involves staged embolization and angioplasty/stenting for relief of venous stenosis. Rarely, jugular foraminal narrowing has been identified as causing jugular bulb stenosis.

   CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 22-month-old female diagnosed with VOGM prenatally who displayed persistent intracranial venous hypertension despite multiple neuroembolization procedures during the neonatal period. Following initial reduction in arteriovenous shunting, she once again developed venous hypertension secondary to jugular bulb stenosis for which angioplasty was attempted. Failure of angioplasty to relieve the venous hypertension prompted skull base imaging, which revealed jugular foraminal ossification and stenosis. Microsurgical jugular foraminotomy followed by balloon angioplasty and stenting significantly reduced jugular pressure gradients. Restenosis requiring re-stenting developed postoperatively at 9 months, but the patient has remained stable with significant improvement in cortical venous congestion.

   DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the efficacy of microsurgical decompression of the jugular foramen and endovascular angioplasty/stenting as a novel treatment paradigm for the management of intracranial venous hypertension in the setting of VOGM.

Abstract
  Both robotic surgery and head-down tilt increase intracranial pressure by impairing venous blood outflow. Prostatectomy is commonly performed in elderly patients, who are more likely to develop postoperative cognitive disorders. Therefore, increased intracranial pressure could play an essential role in cognitive decline after surgery. We describe a case of a 69-year-old male who underwent a robotic prostatectomy. Noninvasive Brain4careTM intraoperative monitoring showed normal intracranial compliance during anesthesia induction, but it rapidly decreased after head-down tilt despite normal vital signs, low lung pressure, and adequate anesthesia depth. We conclude that there is a need for intraoperative intracranial compliance monitoring since there are major changes in cerebral compliance during surgery, which could potentially allow early identification and treatment of impaired cerebral complacency.

Abstract
  A new cancer diagnosis is expected to affect approximately 1.9 million people in the United States in 2021. A small percentage of these patients will experience an emergent cancer-related complication. Oncologic emergencies may be encountered in emergency departments or require intensive care management. Patients newly diagnosed with cancer are more likely to present with emergencies related to the underlying malignancies. Oncologic emergencies can have various manifestations, ranging from mechanical obstruction due to tumor growth to metabolic derangements due to abnormal secretions from the tumor. Therefore, early identification and treatment of life-threatening oncologic events is critical. Although there are several different types of oncologic emergencies, this article focuses on metabolic emergencies (tumor lysis syndrome and cytoreductive hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) and structural emergencies (increased intracranial pressure and vena cava thrombus). The purpose of this article is to provide acute care clinicians with an overview of selected oncologic emergencies and their evidence-based management.

Abstract
  Tinnitus is an abnormal perception of a sound without external stimulation. Venous pulsatile tinnitus (VPT) is a specific form of tinnitus characterized by an objective and often subjective bruit that occurs as a result of localized venous abnormalities. Clinical evaluation relies on sound quality, duration, and precipitating factors. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) are among the most common causes of VPT. Other causes include sigmoid sinus wall abnormalities (SSWAs), jugular vein anomalies (JVAs), and emissary veins anomalies. These anomalies can be detected on magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography/magnetic resonance venography, and high-resolution temporal bone computed tomography. The pathogenesis behind the VPT includes turbulent blood flow as a result of luminal stenosis or abnormal dilation, amplification of internal sound due to temporal bone defects, and abnormal position of the venous sinus system structures adjacent to the bony structures of the auditive apparatus. Based on these theories, different interventional treatment modalities can be applied to treat the underlying causes. Endovascular treatments have shown high efficacy and safety among those treatments which include stenting of the lateral sinus stenosis in IIH and TSS, coiling of the SSWA and JVA, and embolization of emissary veins anomalies. Further studies are needed to understand the natural history of these anomalies and the efficacy of treatments of VPT, which-unlike other types of tinnitus-can be cured with proper treatment.

Abstract
  Objective: To study the clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies for vein-related pulsatile tinnitus patients with transverse sinus stenosis. Methods: The clinical data of patients with vein-related pulsatile tinnitus, from January 2015 to August 2019, were collected,whose digital subtraction angiography showing transverse sinus stenosis. Taking December 2019 as the last follow-up time, we analyzed the clinical characteristics, CT angiography and digital subtraction angiography results, lumbar puncture pressure and cerebrospinal fluid composition, and other auxiliary examination results (pure tone audiometry, fundus examination of papilledema, carotid ultrasonography, bone density screening, endocrinous test), as well as tinnitus handicap inventory, treatment options and follow-up results. Results: 83 patients were enrolled with female of 89.2% (74/83) and male of 10.8%(9/83); 65.1% (54/83) with right tinnitus, 31.3% (26/83) with left tinnitus, and 3.6% (3/83) with bilateral tinnitus; 67.5% (56/83) with right dominant sinus, 19.3% (16/83) with left dominant sinus, 13.3% (11/83) with bilateral equalization; Bilateral and ipsilateral stenosis accounted for 55.4% and 44.6% respectively; BMI was overweight or obese in 41 cases (49.4%, 41/83). Patients with tinnitus handicap inventory level three or above accounted for 79.5% (66/83). Eventually, 33 patients chose conservative observation (39.8%, 33/83), 40 patients (48.2%), 8 patients (9.6%) and 2 patients (2.4%) received sigmoid sinus-related surgery, interventional surgery, or emissary vein occlusion respectively. The mean follow-up time of 74 patients was 26.2 months. The data of 48 surgery patients showed that the pressure differences of venous sinus among the recurrent patients were more obvious; Interventional surgery with simultaneous stenting placement was effective. Tinnitus did not decrease in two patients with emissary vein occlusion. Analysis of 26 patients with lumbar puncture revealed eight cases of normal cranial pressure and 18 cases of high cranial pressure. The sinus pressure difference between the two groups was different (P=0.025), but the difference of age of onset, concomitant symptoms, BMI, proportion of empty sella or papilledema was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Conclusions: The evaluation of patients with vein-related pulsatile tinnitus requires a standardized procedure. Papilledema cannot be used as a sensitive indicator in patients with early intracranial hypertension. Venous sinus pressure difference may be one of the indicators of intracranial hypertension, and the lumbar puncture is the gold standard for the diagnosis. Weight loss can be used as a conservative treatment during the observation period. Significant sinus stenosis is a risk factor for recurrence in patients undergoing sigmoid sinus surgery. Interventional stenting is an effective treatment for tinnitus secondary to transverse sinus stenosis.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: A patent persistent occipital sinus (OS) can be seen in 10% of adults. The presence of such a dominant draining OS can present as a challenge for posterior fossa surgeries. Occlusion or division of the sinus can cause venous hypertension, causing a cerebellar bulge or increased intra-op bleeding.

   CASE REPORT: A 3-and-a-half-year-old female child presented with a vermian medulloblastoma with hydrocephalus. MR venography (MRV) revealed a large patent OS draining from the torcula to the right sigmoid sinus. She underwent a left Frazier's point VP shunt followed by a midline suboccipital craniotomy for the lesion. The OS was divided during a "Y"-shaped durotomy. Following the sinus ligation, there was a significant cerebellar bulge and excessive bleeding from the lesion. We released cisternal CSF and punctured the tumor cysts to allow the brain bulge to settle. Hemostasis was secured, and surgery was deferred, an augmented duroplasty was done, and bone flap was removed to allow for intracranial pressure decompression. The patient was electively ventilated for 24 h and weaned off gradually. A repeat MRV at 7 days showed the reorganization of the venous outflow at the torcula. Reexploration with tumor resection was done on post-op day 10. The patient recovered well from the surgery and was referred for adjuvant therapy.

   CONCLUSION: Surgeons should carefully analyze venous anatomy before posterior fossa surgeries. The persistent dominant OS, when present, should be taken care of while planning the durotomy. A hypoplastic but persistent transverse sinus allowed us to ligate and divide the OS. By doing a staged division of the sinus, reorganization of the venous outflow from the torcula can be allowed to occur, and the lesion can be resected. Copyright © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Abstract
  Advances in multiparametric brain monitoring have allowed us to deepen our knowledge of the physiopathology of head injury and how it can be treated using the therapies available today. It is essential to understand and interpret a series of basic physiological and physiopathological principles that, on the one hand, provide an adequate metabolic environment to prevent worsening of the primary brain injury and favour its recovery, and on the other hand, allow therapeutic resources to be individually adapted to the specific needs of the patient. Based on these notions, this article presents a decalogue of the physiological objectives to be achieved in brain injury, together with a series of diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for achieving these goals. We emphasise the importance of considering and analysing the physiological variables involved in the transport of oxygen to the brain, such as cardiac output and arterial oxygen content, together with their conditioning factors and possible alterations. Special attention is paid to the basic elements of physiological neuroprotection, and we describe the multiple causes of cerebral hypoxia, how to approach them, and how to correct them. We also examine the increase in intracranial pressure as a physiopathological element, focussing on the significance of thoracic and abdominal pressure in the interpretation of intracranial pressure. Treatment of intracranial pressure should be based on a step-wise model, the first stage of which should be based on a physiopathological reflection combined with information on the tomographic lesions rather than on rigid numerical values.

Abstract
  Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is increasingly being recognized as an indispensable and significant physiological parameter in intensive care units (ICU). IAP has been measured in a variety of ways with the development of many techniques in recent years. The level of intra-abdominal pressure under normal conditions is generally equal to or less than 12 mmHg. Accordingly, abdominal hypertension (IAH) is defined as two consecutive IAP measurements higher than 12 mmHg within 4-6 h. When IAH deteriorates further with IAP higher than 20 mmHg along with organ dysfunction and/or failure, this clinical manifestation can be diagnosed as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). IAH and ACS are associated with gastrointestinal ischemia, acute renal failure, and lung injury, leading to severe morbidity and mortality. Elevated IAP and IAH may affect the cerebral venous return and outflow of the cerebrospinal fluid by increasing the intrathoracic pressure (ITP), ultimately leading to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Therefore, it is essential to monitor IAP in critically ill patients. The reproducibility and accuracy of intra-bladder pressure (IBP) measurements in previous studies need to be further improved, although the indirect measurement of IAP is now a widely used technique. To address these limitations, we recently used a set of IAP monitoring systems with advantages of convenience, continuous monitoring, digital visualization, and long-term IAP recording and data storage in critically ill patients. This IAP monitoring system can detect intra-abdominal hypertension and potentially analyze clinical status in real time. The recorded IAP data and other physiological indicators, such as intracranial pressure, can be further used for correlation analysis to guide treatment and predict a patient's possible prognosis.

Abstract
  ABSTRACT: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in civilian trauma and battlefield settings. It has been classified across a continuum of dysfunctions, with as much as 80% to 90% of cases diagnosed as mild to moderate in combat casualties. In this report, a framework is presented that focuses on the potential benefits for acute noninvasive treatment of reduced cerebral perfusion associated with mild TBI by harnessing the natural transfer of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration. This process is known as intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) therapy, which can be applied by having a patient breath against a small inspiratory resistance created by an impedance threshold device. Intrathoracic pressure regulation therapy leverages two fundamental principles for improving blood flow to the brain: (1) greater negative intrathoracic pressure enhances venous return, cardiac output, and arterial blood pressure; and (2) lowering of intracranial pressure provides less resistance to cerebral blood flow. These two effects work together to produce a greater pressure gradient that results in an improvement in cerebral perfusion pressure. In this way, IPR therapy has the potential to counter hypotension and hypoxia, potentially significant contributing factors to secondary brain injury, particularly in conditions of multiple injuries that include severe hemorrhage. By implementing IPR therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate TBI, a potential exists to provide early neuroprotection at the point of injury and a bridge to more definitive care, particularly in settings of prolonged delays in evacuation such as those anticipated in future multidomain operations.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Dural venous sinus injury is a rare complication of otological surgery that can lead to life-threatening sequelae, the management of which is complex and poorly described.

   CASE REPORT: This paper describes the case of a 40-year-old female who underwent routine right myringoplasty complicated by sigmoid sinus laceration. The patient subsequently developed right-sided lateral sinus thrombosis leading to fulminant intracranial hypertension. The patient underwent successful emergency management by surgical reconstruction of the sigmoid sinus, followed by endovascular thrombolysis, catheter balloon angioplasty and endovascular stenting.

   CONCLUSION: Torrential haemorrhage following otological procedures is uncommon and rarely requires packing of a bleeding venous sinus. This case highlights that injury to a highly dominant venous sinus can lead to venous outflow obstruction and life-threatening intracranial hypertension. To our knowledge, the development of this complication following otological surgery and its management has not been reported previously.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Acute occlusion of the posterior sagittal sinus may lead to dramatic increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), refractory to standard treatment. Hybrid vascular bypass of cranial venous outflow into the internal jugular vein (IJV) has seldom been described for this in recent neurosurgical literature.

   OBJECTIVE: To describe creation of a novel vascular bypass shunt from the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) to internal jugular vein (IJV) utilizing a covered stent-Dacron graft construct for control of refractory ICP.

   METHODS: We illustrate a patient with refractory ICP increases after acute sinus ligation that was performed to halt torrential bleeding from intraoperative injury. A temporary shunt was created that successfully controlled ICP. From the promising results of the temporary shunt, we utilized a prosthetic hybrid bypass graft to function as a shunt from the sagittal sinus to IJV. Yet the associated anticoagulation led to complications and a poor outcome.

   RESULTS: Rapid and sustained ICP reduction can be expected after sagittal sinus-to-jugular bypass shunt placement in acute sinus occlusion. Details of the surgical technique are described. Heparin anticoagulation, while imperative, is also associated with worrisome complications.

   CONCLUSION: Acute occlusion of posterior third of sagittal sinus carries a very malignant clinical course. Intractable intracranial hypertension from acute sinus occlusion may be effectively treated with a SSS-IJV bypass shunt. A covered stent construct provides an effective vascular bypass conduit. However, the anticoagulation risk can lead to fatal outcomes. The neurosurgeon must always strive for primary repair of an injured sinus. Copyright © 2021.

Abstract
  Objective: To investigate the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) setting of mechanical ventilation guided by esophageal pressure in the treatment of patients with traumatic craniocerebral injury combined with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Methods: The retrospective cohort study was conducted. From June 2016 to June 2018, 55 patients with traumatic craniocerebral injury combined with ARDS who met the inclusion criteria were admitted to Zhengzhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University. According to PEEP setting method, 28 patients were allocated to esophageal pressure group (17 males and 11 females, aged (40+/-13) years) and 27 patients were allocated to PEEP-fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) table group (18 males and 9 females, aged (38+/-10) years). Patients in the 2 groups were treated with mechanical ventilation guided by lung protective ventilation strategy, and the optimal PEEP at 0 (immediately), 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment was determined according to esophageal pressure and PEEP-FiO2 table, respectively. The mechanical ventilation parameters in the 2 groups were adjusted according to the optimal PEEP. The transpulmonary end-expiratory pressure, pulmonary compliance, oxygen index, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and intracranial pressure at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment were recorded. Data were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance for repeated measurement, chi-square test, independent sample t test, and Bonferroni correction. Results: The optimal PEEP of patients in esophageal pressure group at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment was (12.4+/-3.9), (11.2+/-3.5), (13.4+/-2.6), and (13.2+/-3.6) cmH2O (1 cmH2O=0.098 kPa), respectively, which was significantly higher than (8.2+/-2.5), (7.4+/-2.2), (8.3+/-2.3), and (8.5+/-2.5) cmH2O in PEEP-FiO2 table group, respectively (t=4.702, 4.743, 7.849, 5.623, P<0.01). The transpulmonary end-expiratory pressure and pulmonary compliance at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment and oxygen index at 48 and 72 h after treatment of patients in esophageal pressure group were significantly higher than those in PEEP-FiO2 table group (t=17.852, 20.586, 19.532, 4.752, 5.256, 7.446, 2.342, 4.178, P<0.05 or P<0.01). The central venous pressure of patients in esophageal pressure group at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment was significantly higher than that in PEEP-FiO2 table group (t=12.632, 5.247, 8.994, P<0.01), and there was no statistically significant difference in mean arterial pressure of patients between the 2 groups at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment (P>0.05). The intracranial pressure of patients in esophageal pressure group was higher than that in PEEP-FiO2 table group at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: For patients with traumatic craniocerebral injury combined with ARDS, the optimal PEEP can be set under the guidance of esophageal pressure method, and the mechanical ventilation parameters adjusted according to the optimal PEEP can improve lung compliance and accelerate recovery of lung function more effectively, with no adverse effect in mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  Pneumocephalus is commonly seen on imaging in the setting of craniofacial trauma, skull base tumours, intracranial infection and after neurological intervention. Spontaneous pneumocephalus in the absence of these conditions is exceedingly rare, with only approximately 30 cases reported in the literature to date. Spontaneous otogenic pneumocephalus (SOP) is believed to occur as a result of anomalous communication between the intracranial space and a hyper-pneumatised temporal bone, with either positive extra-to-intracranial pressure or negative intracranial pressure gradient. These anomalous communicating channels may only become clinically apparent when triggered by episodes of acute increase in middle ear pressure during coughing, sneezing, Valsalva manoeuvre or significant change in atmospheric pressure. Patients may exhibit a wide range of neurological symptoms and the aim of treatment is to reduce the risk of complications such as infection and intracranial hypertension. Both conservative and neurosurgical approaches have been described. We report a case of SOP in which the patient was conservatively managed, and spontaneous resolution of pneumocephalus was documented on serial computed tomography (CT) scans. This unique case clearly demonstrates the natural history and temporal evolution of SOP without surgical intervention. This knowledge may potentially obviate the need for surgery, thus reducing morbidity and mortality in patients who are poor surgical candidates. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Head-to-foot gravitationally induced hydrostatic pressure gradients in the upright posture on Earth are absent in weightlessness. This results in a relative headward fluid shift in the vascular and cerebrospinal fluid compartments and may underlie multiple physiological consequences of spaceflight, including the spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome. Here, we tested three mechanical countermeasures [lower body negative pressure (LBNP), venoconstrictive thigh cuffs (VTC), and impedance threshold device (ITD) resistive inspiratory breathing] individually and in combination to reduce a posture-induced headward fluid shift as a ground-based spaceflight analog. Ten healthy subjects (5 male) underwent baseline measures (seated and supine postures) followed by countermeasure exposure in the supine posture. Noninvasive measurements included ultrasound [internal jugular veins (IJV) cross-sectional area, cardiac stroke volume, optic nerve sheath diameter, noninvasive IJV pressure], transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (OAE; intracranial pressure index), intraocular pressure, choroidal thickness from optical coherence tomography imaging, and brachial blood pressure. Compared with the supine posture, IJV area decreased 48% with application of LBNP [mean ratio: 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-0.60, P < 0.001], 31% with VTC (mean ratio: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55-0.87, P < 0.001), and 56% with ITD (mean ratio: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.12-1.70, P = 0.46), measured at end-inspiration. LBNP was the only individual countermeasure to decrease the OAE phase angle (DELTA -12.9 degrees, 95% CI: -25 to -0.9, P = 0.027), and use of combined countermeasures did not result in greater effects. Thus, LBNP, and to a lesser extent VTC and ITD, represents promising headward fluid shift countermeasures but will require future testing in analog and spaceflight environments. NEW & NOTEWORTHY As a weightlessness-induced headward fluid shift is hypothesized to be a primary factor underlying several physiological consequences of spaceflight, countermeasures aimed at reversing the fluid shift will likely be crucial during exploration-class spaceflight missions. Here, we tested three mechanical countermeasures individually and in various combinations to reduce a posture-induced headward fluid shift as a ground-based spaceflight analog.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Venous stenting (VS) for venous sinus stenosis in the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been increasing in acceptance by neurointerventionalists. Stent-adjacent stenosis (SAS) and in-stent stenosis leading to symptom recurrence and the need for retreatment are known delayed complications. However, the effect of the dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration on these complications has remained poorly characterized.

   METHODS: An extensive literature search was performed to identify reports of VS for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension from 2000 to 2020. The primary outcome was the occurrence of SAS. The secondary outcomes included the occurrence of composite stenosis (in-stent stenosis and SAS) and stent survival, defined as the need for retreatment or other surgical management. Generalized linear mixed models were used to explore the effects of DAPT duration (3 vs >=6 months) on the primary and secondary outcomes.

   RESULTS: A total of 325 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in our analysis. SAS occurred in 9% (95% confidence interval, 6%-15%) of the patients, and stent survival was 90% (95% confidence interval, 84%-93%) in the cohort. With every 1-mm Hg increase in the venous pressure gradient, an 8% decrease was found in the odds of stent survival (P = 0.043). The meta-regression revealed no association between the DAPT duration and the primary outcome or the odds of composite stenosis and stent survival.

   CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences between 3 and >=6 months of DAPT in terms of the risk of stent stenosis or stent survival. However, patients with a higher venous pressure gradient before VS had a greater risk of stent failure. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Brain herniation into a dural venous sinus is a rare entity of unknown clinical significance without a clear relationship to raised intracranial pressure. There are yet to be detailed reports of interventional neuroradiology procedures involving sinus stenting across brain herniations. The authors of this paper present the first case of a stent placed across a large brain herniation into the transverse sinus in a patient with a tectal plate lesion and features of chronically raised intracranial pressure. This case demonstrates objective resolution of papilloedema and venous sinus pressure gradient at six months without complication.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon neurologic emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality that can be difficult to differentiate from other conditions. It is important for the emergency clinician to be familiar with this disease as it requires a high index of suspicion, and early diagnosis and management can lead to improved outcomes.

   OBJECTIVE: This narrative review provides an evidence-based update concerning the presentation, evaluation, and management of CVT for the emergency clinician.

   DISCUSSION: CVT is due to thrombosis of the cerebral veins resulting in obstruction of venous outflow and increased intracranial pressure. Early recognition is important but difficult as the clinical presentation can mimic more common disease patterns. The most common patient population affected includes women under the age of 50. Risk factors for CVT include pregnancy, medications (oral contraceptives), inherited thrombophilia, prior venous thromboembolic event, malignancy, recent infection, and neurosurgery. CVT can present in a variety of ways, but the most common symptom is headache, followed by focal neurologic deficit, seizure, and altered mental status. Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) venography or magnetic resonance (MR) venography should be obtained in patients with concern for CVT, as non-contrast CT will be normal or have non-specific findings in most patients. Treatment includes anticoagulation, treating seizures and elevated ICP aggressively, and neurosurgical or interventional radiology consultation in select cases.

   CONCLUSIONS: CVT can be a challenging diagnosis. Knowledge of the risk factors, patient presentation, evaluation, and management can assist emergency clinicians. Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  The author reports the cases of two young patients with cortical venous thrombosis(CVT)and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis(CVST)and demonstrates that CT and MRI investigations are critical for the diagnosis. The first case was an 18-year-old woman who developed symptoms of intracranial hypertension and, 20 days later, suffered from left hemiparesis and generalized seizures. A plain CT scan revealed an increased density of cortical veins("cord sign"). MR venography revealed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and right frontal lobe cortical vein thrombosis. The second case was a 15-year-old boy who developed intracranial hypertension symptoms and went to various hospitals but the symptoms progressed. Six weeks after the onset, contrast-enhanced MRI showed an "empty delta sign" and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis was diagnosed. The patients had a history of protein-losing enteropathy and Behcet's disease. Both patients were treated with endovascular and anticoagulation therapy while also treating the primary disease, resulting in thrombus reduction in the sinus and good outcomes. CVT and CVST can lead to severe conditions, so a full understanding of the imaging findings is essential for an accurate diagnosis.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe respiratory symptoms are a hallmark of the disease, which may also include complications related to a hypercoagulable state and central nervous system involvement. These complications can occur during either the acute or the recovery phase. The cerebral involvement typically manifests as intracranial hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, diffuse encephalopathy, or cerebral venous thrombosis. The hemorrhagic form of cerebral venous thrombosis can be a diagnostic challenge and is treated by anticoagulation therapy, despite the existence of an intracerebral hemorrhage. This report describes a case of superficial cerebral venous thrombosis and intracerebral hematoma in a 48-year-old man weeks after recovering from the acute phase of SARSCoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man with a past medical history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction presented with left upper-limb numbness, weakness, and impaired positional sensorium. After initial stabilization, noncontrast computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an intracerebral hemorrhage with underlying cerebral venous thrombosis. The patient was successfully treated with enoxaparin anticoagulation therapy, and symptoms improved over the following 12 days. CONCLUSIONS Central nervous system venous thrombosis is an atypical presentation of the hypercoagulable state primarily seen in younger patients, and it can occur in a delayed fashion after recovery from mild forms of COVID-19.

Abstract
  Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) involves unilateral or bilateral optic disc edema, widening of the optic nerve sheath, and posterior globe flattening. Owing to posterior globe flattening, it is hypothesized that microgravity causes a disproportionate change in intracranial pressure (ICP) relative to intraocular pressure. Countermeasures capable of reducing ICP include thigh cuffs and breathing against inspiratory resistance. Owing to the coupling of central venous pressure (CVP) and intracranial pressure, we hypothesized that both ICP and CVP will be reduced during both countermeasures. In four male participants (32 +/- 13 yr) who were previously implanted with Ommaya reservoirs for treatment of unrelated clinical conditions, ICP was measured invasively through these ports. Subjects were healthy at the time of testing. CVP was measured invasively by a peripherally inserted central catheter. Participants breathed through an impedance threshold device (ITD, -7 cmH2O) to generate negative intrathoracic pressure for 5 min, and subsequently, wore bilateral thigh cuffs inflated to 30 mmHg for 2 min. Breathing through an ITD reduced both CVP (6 +/- 2 vs. 3 +/- 1 mmHg; P = 0.02) and ICP (16 +/- 3 vs. 12 +/- 1 mmHg; P = 0.04) compared to baseline, a result that was not observed during the free breathing condition (CVP, 6 +/- 2 vs. 6 +/- 2 mmHg, P = 0.87; ICP, 15 +/- 3 vs. 15 +/- 4 mmHg, P = 0.68). Inflation of the thigh cuffs to 30 mmHg caused no meaningful reduction in CVP in all four individuals (5 +/- 4 vs. 5 +/- 4 mmHg; P = 0.1), coincident with minimal reduction in ICP (15 +/- 3 vs. 14 +/- 4 mmHg; P = 0.13). The application of inspiratory resistance breathing resulted in reductions in both ICP and CVP, likely due to intrathoracic unloading. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Spaceflight causes pathological changes in the eye that may be due to the absence of gravitational unloading of intracranial pressure (ICP) under microgravity conditions commonly referred to as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), whereby countermeasures aimed at lowering ICP are necessary. These data show that impedance threshold breathing acutely reduces ICP via a reduction in central venous pressure (CVP). Whereas, acute thigh cuff inflation, a popular known spaceflight-associated countermeasure, had little effect on ICP and CVP.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Sinus pericranii (SP) is a rare vascular malformation which connects the intracranial dural sinuses to the extracranial venous drainage system. Although the majority of SP cases are caused by trauma, some of them are congenital. Furthermore, a few SP cases have been reported in association with craniosynostosis. The authors' objective is to discuss the surgical management of SP with Crouzon's syndrome in children.

   METHODS: Three-Dimensional reconstruction with enhanced CT scan was used for evaluate the condition of SP with Crouzon's syndrome in all 4 cases. Two cases with small single-hole defect on skull were only treated by cranioplasty with distraction osteogenesis. In the management of the other 2 SP patients with large skull defect, titanium mesh was used for compression of dilated venous sinus to inhabit filling and promote shrinking.

   RESULT: Four cases of SP with Crouzon's syndrome were treated in the authors' department. With cranioplasty with distraction osteogenesis only, 2 patients with single-hole skull defect experienced SP spontaneous involution at 4 to 6 months postoperatively. With titanium mesh compression, SP with large skull defect shrank significantly without clinical recurrence, but long-term follow-up was still in need.

   CONCLUSION: For small single-hole skull defect in SP patient with Crouzon's syndrome, the only application of cranioplasty for decreasing intracranial pressure can promote SP spontaneous involution. 3D printed titanium mesh compression renders a safe and efficient approach for SP with large skull defect. Long-time follow up and further accumulation of cases may establish the efficacy of the authors' management. Copyright © 2020 by Mutaz B. Habal, MD.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: During prolonged spaceflight, astronauts often experience ocular changes, due to constant head-ward fluid shifts in space as compared with Earth. This article reviews symptoms, likely causes, and potential solutions, such as lower body negative pressure, to counteract space-associated neuroocular syndrome (SANS).

   RECENT FINDINGS: Low gravity conditions and other aspects of spaceflight affect the eye detrimentally, causing SANS which is characterized by optic disc edema, choroidal thickening, cotton wool spots, and a hyperopic shift. SANS is probably caused by altered hemodynamic flows in the head and neck as well as mildly elevated intracranial and intraocular pressures. Carbon dioxide and other chemicals in space-craft may influence SANS as well. SANS may be counteracted by using lower body negative pressure, thigh cuffs, spacecraft engineering, and/or artificial gravity by a centrifuge.

   SUMMARY: Prolonged space missions are associated with optic disc edema, choroidal thickening, cotton wool spots, and a hyperopic shift. Possible causes and countermeasures are currently being researched to reduce the risk of SANS. Although many countermeasures to SANS are under investigation lower body negative pressure exhibits great promise in counteracting the headward fluid shifts in space. Understanding and prevention of SANS is critical to future space exploration, especially to long-duration missions to the moon and Mars.

Abstract
  The authors describe a follow-up to a case of a 19-year-old female with shunted aqueductal stenosis who presented with low-pressure hydrocephalus during a shunt malfunction. Shortly after management with CSF drainage at negative pressure, a magnetic resonance elastography scan was performed and revealed very low brain stiffness (high compliance). Here we present the case of the same patient seen 2 years later, now 21 years old, who again received a magnetic resonance elastography scan after receiving treatment for another shunt malfunction, this time with high intracranial pressure. This scan revealed recovery of brain stiffness to a near normal value for the patients' age. This observation suggests the low brain stiffness observed during the low-pressure hydrocephalus event is reversible. The authors discuss these findings in relation to biomechanical hypotheses of low-pressure hydrocephalus. Copyright © 2020. Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Abnormal forces around the optic nerve head (ONH) due to orbital diseases, intracranial hypertension (IH), glaucoma, and space travel, are associated with alterations of the ONH shape. Elevated cerebral and ophthalmic venous pressure can contribute to stress and strain on the ONH and peripapillary retina. We hypothesize that IH and elevated ophthalmic venous pressure without IH cause different ONH and retinal changes.

   METHODS: We compared MRI and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) findings in patients with cavernous sinus arteriovenous shunts (CSAVSs), where orbital venous pressure is known to be elevated, with patients with intracranial dural venous sinus thrombosis and secondary IH. We also compared the results to those obtained in the Idiopathic IH (IIH) Treatment Trial.

   RESULTS: Among 18 patients with dural venous sinus thrombosis, the MRI/magnetic resonance venography displayed partial empty sella (61%) and optic nerve sheath distension (67%). None exhibited ophthalmic vein dilation or signs of orbital congestion. SDOCT of these eyes and IIH eyes showed a similar frequency of abnormal thickening of the mean retinal nerve fiber layer, anterior displacement of the basement membrane opening, peripapillary wrinkles, retinal folds (RF), and choroidal folds (CF). Among 21 patients with CSAVSs, MRI showed ipsilateral dilated superior ophthalmic vein (76%) and orbital congestion (52%) without distension of the optic nerve sheath or globe distortion. SDOCT showed CF (19%), one with overlying RF, and no ONH deformations.

   CONCLUSIONS: SDOCT findings for dural venous sinus thrombosis are similar to those seen with IIH but distinct from changes due to local ophthalmic venous hypertension. These data support the concept that IH even if due to a vascular cause and local orbital venous hypertension cause different stresses and strains on the ONH.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disease of raised intra-cranial pressure of unknown etiology. Lateral cerebral venous sinus stenosis (VSS) has been increasingly reported in these patients, and stenting has emerged as an alternative treatment for medically refractory symptoms. Treatment efficacy on meta-analysis appears promising, but identifying which patients are likely to benefit most, and which are likely to require repeat procedures, is currently unclear.

   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of 79 patients treated with venous sinus stenting at a single academic center with minimum follow-up of 18 months. We extracted baseline clinical data, as well as manometry at lumbar puncture and during angiography, and used logistic regression to identify parameters that could predict stent failure.

   RESULTS: Retreatment rate after successful VSS was 13.9%. Lumbar puncture opening pressure (OP) was shown to significantly predict treatment failure (s=0.06; OR=1.064 (1.003-1.135); P=0.039). This effect remained significant when age, sex and body mass index were added to the model (s=0.06; OR=1.066 (1.002-1.140); P=0.043). OP was correlated with venous sinus manometry readings in the superior sagittal and transverse sinus pre-stent placement, as well trans-stenotic gradient (P<0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: Higher lumbar puncture OP was associated with an increased risk of stent failure in transverse sinus stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, although the performance of this model as a linear discriminator was poor. Further studies are required to better assess which patients are at greatest risk of treatment failure. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. No commercial re-use.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Combined burn and traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment priorities may not align due to opposing fluid resuscitation paradigms used in treating burns and TBI. We developed a porcine model of combined thermal injury/TBI and compared an "aggressive" fluid resuscitation strategy using the Parkland formula and a "restrictive" resuscitation strategy using the modified Brooke formula.

   METHODS: Twenty-eight swine were deeply anesthetized and received a 40% total body surface area full-thickness burn injury and TBI. Swine were then randomized to receive restrictive or aggressive resuscitation for 8 h after which time animals were euthanized and necropsy was performed. Volume of brain injury was assessed after analyzing segmental slices of brain tissue.

   RESULTS: There were no differences between the restrictive and aggressive resuscitation groups in blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, intra-cranial pressure (ICP), or serum lactate levels after 8 h of resuscitation. Urine output was higher in the aggressive resuscitation group. The restrictive group had a significantly higher serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) compared with baseline and compared with the aggressive group. There was no significant difference in size of brain injury between groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Both restrictive and aggressive resuscitation demonstrated adequate resuscitation at 8 h postinjury. Increased serum BUN in the restrictive group may be an indicator of early acute kidney injury, despite adequate urine output. Resuscitation strategy did not appear to affect ICP or the size of brain injury. Copyright © 2020 by the Shock Society.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus stenting is an established treatment for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), refractory to medical management and with stenotic venous sinus on conventional cerebral venography. Currently, there are no clear guidelines on optimal noninvasive imaging modality for routine post-stenting follow-up. We investigated diagnostic yield of CT venography (CTV) for evaluation of stent patency.

   METHODS: We reviewed our clinical database of patients with a diagnosis of IIH, who underwent stenting of stenotic transverse or transverse/sigmoid sinus junction. Patients who had follow-up CTVs after more than 30 days were included in the final study group. All CTVs were reviewed by two readers for in-stent thrombosis, extrinsic stent compression, juxta-stent stenosis, and new contralateral venous sinus stenosis. Inter-observer agreement and association of stent patency with clinical outcomes (headache and papilledema) were assessed.

   RESULTS: In all 36 included patients with 38 cerebral venograms for stenting, follow-up CTVs demonstrated adequate opacifications of the venous sinuses and stents for confident evaluation for in-stent thrombosis, extrinsic stent compression, juxta-stent stenosis, and new contralateral venous sinus stenosis, with inter-observer agreement coefficient of 0.7, 1.0, 0.8, and 1.0 respectively. Association between abnormal CTV and higher rates of persistent headache and lower rates of headache improvement/resolution was statistically significant (P-value of 0.01).

   CONCLUSION: CTV is a reliable noninvasive imaging modality for evaluation of cerebral venous sinuses and stent patency following treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension with venous sinus stenting and could be used as a routine follow-up study.

Abstract
  Abnormal venous drainage in patients with craniofacial anomalies is relativity uncommon. Sinus pericranii is a rare vascular malformation characterized by communication between intracranial dural sinuses and extracranial venous drainage systems. The association between sinus pericranii and amniotic band syndrome has not been described. We report on a 7-month-old girl diagnosed with amniotic band sequence who underwent posterior fossa decompression due to intracranial hypertension and Chiari malformation type I. The computed tomography and magnetic resonance identified the connection between the sagittal sinus and the scalp. During the operation, the presence of sinus pericranii was a complicating factor limiting the proper exposure because of the risk of bleeding. Patients with craniofacial anomalies and sinus pericranii present an increased risk of serious surgical complications and consequences from craniofacial surgery, especially from cranioplasty and posterior decompression. Special attention must be paid to abnormal venous drainage, and vascular imaging studies are sometimes required.

Abstract
  Sphenoid wing dural AVFs represent a rare clinical entity. These lesions may be asymptomatic or present with focal neurologic deficits, intracranial venous hypertension, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and diagnostic imaging. They are alternatively classified as lesions of either the greater or lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. We performed a search of the PubMed database of studies evaluating the clinical behavior and surgical and endovascular therapies of these lesions. Dural AVFs draining into the superficial middle cerebral vein and/or laterocavernous sinus, or rather, lesions of the greater wing of the sphenoid, exhibit a greater likelihood of developing an aggressive clinical course, with higher probability of cortical venous reflux and consequent intracranial venous hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, and symptomatic presentation. Dural AVFs of the sphenoparietal sinus, that is, lesions of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, typically exhibit a more benign clinical course, as there is a prominent epidural venous drainage into the cavernous sinus, reducing the risk of cortical venous reflux, and consequently, the probability of intracranial venous hypertension, hemorrhage, and floridly symptomatic presentation. These lesions may be treated via surgical clipping of the fistulous point, transarterial or transvenous embolization, and/or stereotactic radiosurgery. Though surgical intervention was the principal therapy due to facility of craniotomy access to the fistulous point, embolization has become standard of care permitted by innovation in endovascular technology. The natural history, clinical presentation, angioarchitecture, diagnosis, and management of these lesions are reviewed and discussed.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The American Stroke Association and the European Stroke Organization have established guidelines on cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT); however, questions remain when an individual case does not fall within the inclusion criteria on which these guidelines are based. This is relevant when considering the use of anticoagulation in cases of CVT regarding whether or not associated hemorrhage is present and whether the hemorrhage is currently expanding.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 16-year-old right-handed female G2P2 (gravidity 2 [2 pregnancies] and parity 2 [2 live births after at least 24 weeks) presented 8 days postpartum with complaints of slurred speech, right facial droop, and right upper extremity numbness that had progressed over the course of 4 hours before presentation. On imaging the patient had a CVT with associated hemorrhage progressing in size at serial 6-hour stability computed tomography scans for 24 hours post arrival. At 24 hours the patient went into disseminated intravascular coagulation and demonstrated signs of herniation. The patient underwent an emergency hemicraniectomy along with a right frontal external ventricular drain for intracranial pressure monitoring. Most recently, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 and had a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 and was ultimately discovered to have antiphospholipid syndrome.

   CONCLUSIONS: This case of CVT demonstrates the need for critically reading guidelines, as in this case the time to anticoagulation treatment was shorter than in cases included in guideline construction and repeated computed tomography examination demonstrated expansion suggesting it is unsuitable for immediate anticoagulation. Certain cases may fall outside of the study parameters on which guidelines are constructed, and clinicians should be aware of these exceptions. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To know the critical care resources of the different class-hospitals in Guizhou Province, China, and to provide the direction and evidence for quality improvement and discipline construction of critical care medicine in Guizhou Province.

   METHODS: The resource status of the departments of intensive care unit (ICU) in Guizhou Province was obtained through form filling and/or field investigation. The forms were filled and submitted from May 2017 to February 2018, and the field investigation (some of the hospitals) was carried out in March 2018. The data of hospitals in Guizhou Province in 2018, was obtained from the official website of Health Committee of Guizhou Province, which was released online on November 28th, 2019. The obtained data were summarized and analyzed according to different aspects such asthe status of ICU construction, main equipment configuration and technology implementation.

   RESULTS: There were 39 third-class hospitals and 77 second-class hospitals included in this study, which accounted for 76.5% (39/51) of third-class public hospitals and 50.0% (77/154) of second-class public hospitals respectively. Among them, there were 86.8% (33/38) of third-class general hospitals and 50.4% (69/137) of second-class general hospitals respectively. In terms of ICU construction, compared with the ICUs of second-class hospitals, the ICUs of third-class hospitals were established earlier [years: 2011 (2008, 2012) vs. 2013 (2011, 2015), P < 0.01], had more ICU beds, doctors and nurses [15 (11, 20) vs. 8 (6, 10), 9 (8, 11) vs. 6 (5, 7), 25 (20, 41) vs. 15 (12, 19), respectively, all P < 0.01]. However, there were no significant differences regarding the doctor-bed ratio and the nurse-bed ratio in ICUs between second-class hospitals and third-class hospitals. In terms of main equipment configuration, compared with the ICUs of second-class hospitals, the ICUs of third-class hospitals had more ventilators, higher ratio of ventilators to beds, more infusion pumps, higher ratio of infusion pumps to beds, more monitor, gastrointestinal nutrition pumps and single rooms, and higher proportion of ICUs equipped with negative pressure rooms [ventilators: 14 (10, 18) vs. 6 (4, 8), ratio of ventilators to beds: 1.0 (0.7, 1.1) vs. 0.8 (0.6, 1.0), infusion pumps: 10 (6, 20) vs. 5 (3, 8), ratio of infusion pumps to beds: 0.8 (0.0, 1.0) vs. 0.0 (0.0, 0.4), monitor: 18 (13, 24) vs. 9 (6, 12), gastrointestinal nutrition pumps: 2 (1, 5) vs. 1 (0, 3), single rooms: 2 (1, 3) vs. 1 (0, 3), proportion of ICUs equipped with negative pressure rooms: 53.8% (21/39) vs. 31.5% (23/73), respectively, all P < 0.05]. Furthermore, there were higher proportions of ICUs equipped with portable ventilator, pulse indicator continuous cardiac output monitoring (PiCCO), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), B ultrasound machine, bronchoscope, pressure of end-tidal carbondioxide (PETCO2) monitoring, bispectral index (BIS) monitoring, bedside gastroscopy, the apparatus used for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis of lower extremity in third-class hospitals than in second-class hospitals [portable ventilator: 86.7% (26/30) vs. 59.6% (28/47), 43.3% (13/30) vs. 1.5% (1/66), 14.3% (4/28) vs. 0% (0/65), 10.7% (3/28) vs. 0% (0/65), 62.5% (20/32) vs. 37.3% (25/67), 97.1% (33/34) vs. 63.6% (42/66), 60.6% (20/33) vs. 28.4% (19/67), 17.2% (5/29) vs. 0% (0/65), 27.6% (8/29) vs. 1.5% (1/65), 77.4% (24/31) vs. 52.3% (34/65), respectively, all P < 0.05]. In terms of skills development, there were more ICUs carried out intracranial pressure monitoring, abdominal pressure monitoring, ultrasound diagnosis, bronchoscope examination and treatment and blood purification in third-class hospitals than in second-class hospitals [31.6% (12/38) vs. 14.7% (11/75), 75.7% (28/37) vs. 38.6% (27/70), 61.5% (24/39) vs. 24.3% (18/74), 89.7% (35/39) vs. 45.9% (34/74), 92.3% (36/39) vs. 48.6% (36/74), respectively, all P < 0.05].

   CONCLUSIONS: The data were mainly derived from public general hospitals in Guizhou Province. Compared with the ICUs of second-class hospitals, the ICUs of third-class hospitals were founded earlier and larger, had better hardware configuration and could carry out more skills. However, the human resource situations were similar between second-class hospitals and third-class hospitals. Both second-class hospitals and third-class hospitals have a need to improve the allocation of manpower and equipment and expand various skills in ICUs, while it is more urgent for second-class hospitals.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Pressure gradients across venous stenosis are used as a marker for physiologically significant narrowing in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Performing such measurements under conscious sedation (CS) more likely reflects physiologic conditions, but can be uncomfortable, leading some operators to perform measurement under general anesthesia (GA), though this may not be equivalent.

   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who received endovascular transverse sinus stenting due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension between August 2013 and May 2017. Patients' demographics and anesthetic parameters were collected along with venous pressure measurements.

   RESULTS: We identified 15 patients (14 women). The mean (SD) age was 30.5 (9.0) years and the mean body mass index (SD) was 39.5 (9.6) kg/m2. After measurements during CS, GA was induced with propofol and maintained with a volatile anesthetic. The median [IQR; range] transverse sinus pressure gradient under CS was 18 [12, 25; 6-38] mmHg compared with 14 [8, 21; 3-26] mm Hg under GA. The median [IQR; range] pressure gradient change after initiation of GA was -3 [-12, 0; -22 to 9] mm Hg (P = 0.014). After correction for increases in internal jugular vein pressures associated with assumption of GA, the median [IQR; range] gradient change was -11 [-12.5, -5; -22 to 0] mm Hg (P < 0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: The transition from CS to GA results in clinically meaningful reductions in transverse sinus gradients in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Correction for increases in the internal jugular vein pressures reveals even more dramatic reductions in transverse sinus gradients. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, often presents with severe headache and associated vision loss. Venous outflow obstruction has been noted as a prominent etiologic factor in many cases, and previous anatomic studies have shown that the internal jugular (IJ) vein at the skull base can be prone to compression by the neighboring bony structures.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a case of 13-yr-old male with a multifactorial intracranial hypertension including compression of the IJ vein by the transverse process of C1. Computerized tomography angiographic imaging revealed bilateral stenosis of the IJ veins due to compression from the transverse processes of C1. Medical management and shunt were attempted without resolution of symptoms. A hemodynamically significant stenosis at the right IJ was confirmed with manometry and so the C1 transverse process was resected and a stent placed endovascularly with resolution of pressure gradient and clinical symptoms.

   CONCLUSION: Contribution of C1 compression to this patient's intracranial hypertension suggests that evaluation for IJ compression below the skull base may be needed to identify the underlying cause of intracranial hypertension in certain patients. Furthermore, surgical decompression of the IJ vein may be required as part of the treatment strategy. If venous stenting is being considered, this decompressive step must be taken before stenting is performed. We offer this case as evidence that decompression of the IJ vein by C1 lateral mass resection can be an effective and novel technique in the repertoire of neurosurgical management of intracranial hypertension.

Abstract
  The incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is increasing due to the widespread use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for investigating patients with acute headaches and new onset of seizures. Alternatively referred to as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) or dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST), the terms encompass a broad spectrum of neurological pathologies. These include dural venous sinus thrombosis, cortical vein thrombosis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, venous infarction/haemorrhage, and the rare sequelae of intracranial hypertension or dural arteriovenous fistula. Timely and accurate diagnosis is critical; most patients are young adults and up to 15% will die in the acute phase of the condition. Imaging diagnosis using unenhanced CT or CT venography (CTV) can be readily achieved by the general radiologist. MRI or MRI venography (MRV) are powerful techniques, provided the radiologist is aware of critical diagnostic pitfalls. In selected cases, cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) can facilitate both diagnosis and anticoagulant/transcatheter thrombolytic therapy improving clinical outcome. This article will outline the condition, highlighting cerebral venous anatomy, diagnostic techniques, and pitfalls pertinent to all practising radiologists. Crown Copyright © 2020.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND Cerebral venous sinus obstruction associated with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is an extremely rare complication of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. There is little information available on the efficacy of therapeutic options because of its rarity and extremely poor prognosis. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old man presented with severe headache, vomiting, and visual loss for 1 month. Head magnetic resonance venography (MRV) showed occlusion of the left transverse sinus. Gd-enhanced MRI showed no abnormal enhancement. Lumbar puncture intracranial pressure was higher than 40 cmH2O. Positive cerebrospinal fluid tumor cytology confirmed the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC). The headache was relieved by repeated lumbar punctures, and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was performed. Cerebral angiography showed severe stenosis of the left transverse sinus without thrombosis, and significant delay of cerebral circulation. The transverse sinus stenosis was judged to be contributing to raised intracranial pressure, and the patient underwent left transverse sinus stent placement. After the procedure, his visual acuity improved, the visual field was enlarged, and his headache could be controlled by medication. Follow-up Gd-enhanced MRI showed dural enhancement and spinal dissemination. Because molecular biology of the surgical specimen showed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations, he was treated with osimertinib for 2 months. He survived for 8 months following the diagnosis of LC and left transverse sinus stenosis. CONCLUSIONS Venous sinus stenting can offer an effective palliative interventional option for symptom relief of severe headache and visual symptoms, even in the end stage of malignancy.

  Deep brain stimulation has become an established therapeutic choice to manage the symptoms of medically refractory Parkinson's disease. Its efficacy is highly dependent on the accuracy of electrodes' positioning in the correct anatomical target. During DBS procedure, the opening of the dura mater induces the displacement of neural structures. This effect mainly depends on the loss of the physiological negative intracranial pressure, air inflow, and loss of cerebrospinal fluid. Several studies concentrated on correcting surgical techniques for DBS electrodes' positioning in order to reduce pneumocephalus which may result in therapeutic failure. The authors focused in particular on reducing the brain air window and maintaining the pressure gradient between intra- and extracranial compartments. A significant reduction of pneumocephalus and brain shift was obtained by excluding the opening of the subarachnoid space, by covering the dura mater opening with tissue sealant and by reducing the intracranial pressure in general anesthesia. Smaller burr hole diameters were not statistically relevant for reducing air inflow and displacement of anatomical targets. The review of the literature showed that conserving a physiological intra-extracranial pressure gradient plays a fundamental role in avoiding pneumocephalus and consequent displacement of brain structures, which improves surgical accuracy and DBS long-term results.

Abstract
  Venous sinus stenting is an accepted and minimally invasive treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension associated with significant venous sinus stenosis. There is inherent difficulty in navigating past the region of venous stenosis in order to safely deliver and deploy a stent. We have developed the "Cobra" technique, which allows for the safe and efficient navigation past regions of high-grade venous sinus stenosis.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cerebral metabolic perturbations are common in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Monitoring cerebral metabolism with intracerebral microdialysis (CMD) allows early detection of secondary injury and may guide decisions on neurocritical care interventions, affecting outcome. However, CMD is a regional measuring technique that is influenced by proximity to focal lesions. Continuous microdialysis of the cerebral venous drainage may provide information on global cerebral metabolism relevant for the care of aSAH patients. This observational study aimed to explore the feasibility of jugular bulb microdialysis (JBMD) in aSAH and describe the output characteristics in relation to conventional multimodal monitoring.

   METHODS: Patients with severe aSAH were included at admission or after in-house deterioration when local clinical guidelines prompted extended multimodal monitoring. Non-dominant frontal CMD, intracranial pressure (ICP), partial brain tissue oxygenation pressure (PbtO2), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were recorded every hour. The dominant jugular vein was accessed by retrograde insertion of a microdialysis catheter with the tip placed in the jugular bulb under ultrasound guidance. Glucose, lactate, pyruvate, lactate/pyruvate ratio, glycerol, and glutamate were studied for correlation to intracranial measurements. Modified Rankin scale was assessed at 6 months.

   RESULTS: Twelve adult aSAH patients were monitored during a mean 4.2 +/- 2.6 days yielding 22,041 data points for analysis. No complications related to JBMD were observed. Moderate or strong significant monotonic CMD-to-JBMD correlations were observed most often for glucose (7 patients), followed by lactate (5 patients), and pyruvate, glycerol, and glutamate (3 patients). Moderate correlation for lactate/pyruvate ratio was only seen in one patient. Analysis of critical periods defined by ICP > 20, CPP < 65, or PbtO2 < 15 revealed a tendency toward stronger CMD-to-JBMD associations in patients with many or long critical periods. Possible time lags between CMD and JBMD measurements were only identified in 6 out of 60 patient variables. With the exception of pyruvate, a dichotomized outcome was associated with similar metabolite patterns in JBMD and CMD. A nonsignificant tendency toward greater differences between outcome groups was seen in JBMD.

   CONCLUSIONS: Continuous microdialysis monitoring of the cerebral drainage in the jugular bulb is feasible and safe. JBMD-to-CMD correlation is influenced by the type of metabolite measured, with glucose and lactate displaying the strongest associations. JBMD lactate correlated more often than CMD lactate to CPP, implying utility for detection of global cerebral metabolic perturbations. Studies comparing JBMD to other global measures of cerebral metabolism, e.g., PET CT or Xenon CT, are warranted.

Abstract
  Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis (CS) can present with both intracranial and extracranial manifestations. Extracranial features include proptosis, exorbitism, and midface hypoplasia. Intracranial manifestations can include elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), brainstem compression, foramen magnum stenosis or jugular foramen hypoplasia with resultant venous hypertension and anomalous drainage. While fronto-orbital advancement, cranial vault remodeling, and posterior fossa decompression are standard surgical approaches to normalizing orbito-cranial volume and morphology, associated hydrocephalus, anomalous venous drainage, and tonsillar herniation often affect the timing, safety, and selection of corrective interventions. The surgical decision-making to circumvent venous emissaries, effectively time treatment of hydrocephalus, and address posterior versus anterior pathology primarily has not been widely described in the literature, and is important in the development of guidelines in these complex cases. In this report, we describe the surgical management of a patient with Jackson-Weiss syndrome presenting with delayed, but rapidly progressive bilateral lambdoid CS, severe proptosis, midface hypoplasia, elevated ICP, hydrocephalus, tonsillar ectopia, and severe venous hypertension with anomalous drainage. We review the literature related to management of complex synostosis and present our surgical decision-making in the setting of complex syndromic synostosis to aid in the formation of guidelines toward approaching these cases.

Abstract
  This study aimed to explore whether and how anti-lysyl oxidase (anti-LOX) combined with a vacuum device (VD) could promote penile lengthening and to evaluate the effect on erectile function. This study was performed on four groups of adult rats: control, anti-LOX, VD (negative pressure value of -300 mmHg), and anti-LOX + VD. Penile length was measured by a modified VD method and verified on exposed length data. Intracavernous pressure (ICP) and maximum ICP/mean arterial pressure (MAP) ratio were recorded to assess erectile function. For corpus cavernosum, LOX activity and concentrations of pyridinoline, desmosine, hydroxyproline, and elastin were analyzed; transmission electron microscope and Hart's elastin staining were performed to monitor microstructural changes. Anti-LOX and VD significantly lengthened the penis by 10.8% (3.75 mm) and 8.2% (2.48 mm) compared with the control group, respectively, while anti-LOX + VD achieved the longest penile size (40.58 +/- 0.40 mm) which was 17.4% longer than the control group (34.58 +/- 0.54 mm). After 1-week washout, no penile retraction was observed. Meanwhile, exposed penile length data confirmed that the penis in the anti-LOX + VD group was also significantly longer. Anti-LOX inhibited LOX activity to reduce pyridinoline level, which led the penile tunica albuginea remodeling. However, it had no effect on hydroxyproline, desmosine, and elastin levels. Moreover, anti-LOX had no impact on erectile function, which was determined by ICP and ICP/MAP ratio. These results suggest that anti-LOX elongates the penis by reducing pyridinoline, which induces tunica albuginea remodeling. This lengthening effect was more obvious when combined with a VD. All procedures had no impact on erectile function.

Abstract
  We report a rare case of decompensated chronic internal hydrocephalus in an adult patient. A 35-year-old woman experienced acute intracranial hypertension in 3 weeks after relief of postoperative inflammation in the oral cavity (tooth extraction). MRI revealed severe internal hydrocephalus. Third ventriculostomy was followed by significant clinical improvement. However, postoperative survey and subsequent neuroimaging confirmed no reduction of ventricular system. Thus, decompensation of chronic hydrocephalus following dental intervention and subsequent oral inflammation was assumed. Impaired venous outflow from the brain and destabilization of CSF circulation can be considered as a pathogenetic mechanism.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCS) with and without ultrasound contrast agent has been used to diagnose cerebral venous thrombosis, however, no experience in the diagnosis of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis and with dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) by contrast-enhanced TCCS has been reported yet.

   CASE REPORT: The authors reported a 49-year-old male patient with straight sinus (StS) thrombosis and dAVF. Plain TCCS and contrast-enhanced TCCS demonstrated the direct presentation of the selected feeder and drainage veins of the dAVFs, arterialized venous flow waveform, and an enlarged optic nerve sheath diameter, indicating an increased intracranial pressure, and a filling defect in the StS even after administration of an ultrasound contrast agent. After intravascular thrombolysis and blockage of 2 feeders of the dAVF, TCCS still showed retrograde flow direction in the left basal vein and significantly elevated flow velocity in the StS, reflecting a high venous pressure caused by a high volume of arteriovenous shunt and severe stenosis in the StS. The patient's clinical manifestation did not substantially improve until 3 stents were implanted in the StS, and TCCS unveiled that the stents were well filled with flow signal, and the flow velocity in the StS dramatically decreased.

   CONCLUSIONS: TCCS could provide reliable data about the feeder and drainage veins of dAVF in our case. The extent of an increase in venous flow velocity may be closely associated with clinical manifestations, which may influence therapy. Moreover, TCCS possesses a unique advantage in terms of evaluating the patency of the stents compared with other neuroimaging techniques.

Abstract
  The superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is caused by compression, invasion, and/or thrombosis of the superior vena cava and/or the brachiocephalic veins. Benign SVCS is separated from malignant SVCS. SVCS comprises a broad clinical spectrum reaching from asymptomatic cases to rare life-threatening emergencies with upper airway obstruction and increased intracranial pressure. Symptoms are correlated to the acuity and extent of the venous obstruction and inversely correlated to the development of the venous collateral circuits. Imaging is necessary to determine the exact underlying cause and to guide further interventions. Interventional therapy has widely changed the therapeutic approach in symptomatic patients. This article provides an overview over this complex syndrome and focuses on interventional therapeutic methods and results.

Abstract
  Intracranial high-grade dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) have higher bleeding rates compared to other intracranial vascular malformations. Endovascular treatment is usually recommended for high-grade lesions, aiming at a complete fistula obliteration. However, some patients have vascular abnormalities that limit endovascular access to the precise location of the shunt. Alternative techniques may be considered in this scenario. A middle-aged man presented with intracranial hypertension secondary to a high-grade DAVF. Because of vascular abnormalities precluding transvenous access to the intracranial venous circulation, the patient required treatment by a direct transcranial coil and Onyx embolization of the shunt. Direct transcranial cannulation of a dural sinus is an alternative and effective route for transvenous embolization of DAVFs, especially if abnormal venous anatomy precluding venous access to the required cranial venous system is identified.

Abstract
  A 47-year-old live kidney-donor woman presented with headaches and blurred vision. Neuro-ophthalmological examination demonstrated papilledema and right eye inferior nasal defect. Brain MRV showed no sinus thrombosis but solitary right venous sinus draining the torcular Herophili to right jugular bulb. Lumbar puncture revealed elevated CSF opening pressure of 40 cm H2O with normal composition. She was diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). She did not tolerate medical management and declined CSF diversion surgery. Cerebral angiography and venography showed venous outflow drainage from torcular Herophili through a solitary occipital sinus which has distal severe stenosis and pressure gradient of 10 mmHg. Balloon angioplasty and stenting of the occipital sinus were performed. Post-stenting, the stenosis and pressure gradient resolved. At 3-months follow-up, her symptoms and papilledema had resolved and CSF opening pressure was normal at 15 cm H2O. Aberrant cerebral venous anatomy may cause IIH and can be treatable with neuroendovascular techniques.

Abstract
  Background: Focused ultrasound (FUS) activation of microbubbles (MBs) for blood-brain (BBB) and blood-tumor barrier (BTB) opening permits targeted therapeutic delivery. While the effects of FUS+MBs mediated BBB opening have been investigated for normal brain tissue, no such studies exist for intracranial tumors. As this technology advances into clinical immunotherapy trials, it will be crucial to understand how FUS+MBs modulates the tumor immune microenvironment. Methods and Results:  Bulk RNA sequencing revealed that FUS+MBs BTB/BBB opening (1 MHz, 0.5 MPa peak-negative pressure) of intracranial B16F1cOVA tumors increases the expression of genes related to proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine signaling, pattern recognition receptor signaling, and antigen processing and presentation. Flow cytometry revealed increased maturation (i.e. CD86) of dendritic cells (DCs) in the meninges and altered antigen loading of DCs in both the tumor and meninges. For DCs in tumor draining lymph nodes, FUS+MBs had no effect on maturation and elicited only a trend towards increased presentation of tumor-derived peptide by MHC. Neither tumor endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression nor homing of activated T cells was affected by FUS+MBs. Conclusion:  FUS+MBs-mediated BTB/BBB opening elicits signatures of inflammation; however, the response is mild, transient, and unlikely to elicit a systemic response independent of administration of immune adjuvants.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Head position during care may affect cerebral haemodynamics and contribute to the development of germinal matrix-intraventricular haemorrhage (GM-IVH) in very preterm infants. Turning the head toward one side may occlude jugular venous drainage while increasing intracranial pressure and cerebral blood volume. It is suggested that cerebral venous pressure is reduced and hydrostatic brain drainage improved if the infant is cared for in the supine 'head midline' position.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess whether head midline position is more effective than other head positions for preventing (or preventing extension) of GM-IVH in very preterm infants (< 32 weeks' gestation at birth).

   SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 12 September 2019), Embase (1980 to 12 September 2019), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 12 September 2019). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles.

   SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing caring for very preterm infants in a supine head midline position versus a prone or lateral decubitus position, or undertaking a strategy of regular position change, or having no prespecified position. We included trials enrolling infants with existing GM-IVH and planned to assess extension of haemorrhage in a subgroup of infants. We planned to analyse horizontal (flat) versus head elevated positions separately for all body positions.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were GM-IVH, severe IVH, and neonatal death. We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed-effect model with risk ratio (RR) for categorical data; and mean, standard deviation (SD), and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

   MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs, with a total of 290 infants (either < 30 weeks' gestational age or < 1000 g body weight), met the inclusion criteria. Two trials compared supine midline head position versus head rotated 90degree with the cot flat. One trial compared supine midline head position versus head rotated 90degree with the bed tilted at 30degree. We found no trials that compared supine versus prone midline head position. Meta-analysis of three trials (290 infants) did not show an effect on rates of GM-IVH (RR 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.56; I2 = 0%) and severe IVH (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.33; I2 = 0%). Neonatal mortality (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.93; I2 = 0%; RD -0.09, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01) and mortality until hospital discharge (typical RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.90; I2 = 0%; RD -0.10, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02) were lower in the supine midline head position. The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes because of limitations in study design and imprecision of estimates. We identified one ongoing study.

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found few trial data on the effects of head midline position on GM-IVH in very preterm infants. Although meta-analyses suggest that mortality might be reduced, the certainty of the evidence is very low and it is unclear whether any effect is due to cot tilting (a co-intervention in one trial). Further high-quality RCTs would be needed to resolve this uncertainty. Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract
  Hemorrhagic shock is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in pediatric trauma. Current treatment based on volume resuscitation is associated to adverse effects, and it has been proposed that vasopressors may be used in the pharmacological management of trauma. Terlipressin has demonstrated its usefulness in other pediatric critical care scenarios and its long half-life allows its use as a bolus in an outpatient critical settings. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the addition of a dose of terlipressin to the initial volume expansion produces an improvement in hemodynamic and cerebral perfusion at early stages of hemorrhagic shock in an infant animal model. We conducted an experimental randomized animal study with 1-month old pigs. After 30 minutes of hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure [MAP]<45 mmHg) induced by the withdrawal of blood over 30 min, animals were randomized to receive either normal saline (NS) 30 mL/kg (n = 8) or a bolus of 20 mcg/kg of terlipressin plus 30 mL/kg of normal saline (TP) (n = 8). Global hemodynamic and cerebral monitoring parameters, brain damage markers and histology samples were compared. After controlled bleeding, significant decreases were observed in MAP, cardiac index (CI), central venous pressure, global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI), left cardiac output index, SvO2, intracranial pressure, carotid blood flow, bispectral index (BIS), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and increases in systemic vascular resistance index, heart rate and lactate. After treatment, MAP, GEDI, CI, CPP and BIS remained significantly higher in the TP group. The addition of a dose of terlipressin to initial fluid resuscitation was associated with hemodynamic improvement, intracranial pressure maintenance and better cerebral perfusion, which would mean protection from ischemic injury. Brain monitoring through BIS was able to detect changes caused by hemorrhagic shock and treatment.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is commonly applied in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). However, the individual responsiveness of intracranial pressure (ICP) to PEEP varies. Thus, identifying an indicator detecting ICP responsiveness to PEEP is of great significance. As central venous pressure (CVP) could act as an intermediary to transduce pressure from PEEP to ICP, we developed a new indicator, PICGap, representing the gap between baseline ICP and baseline CVP. The aim of the current study was to explore the relationship between PICGap and ICP responsiveness to PEEP.

   METHODS: A total of 112 patients with sTBI undergoing MV were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. ICP, CVP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), static compliance of the respiratory system (Cst), and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PetCO2) were recorded at the initial (3 cmH2O) and adjusted (15 cmH2O) levels of PEEP. PICGap was assessed as baseline ICP - baseline CVP (when PEEP = 3 cmH2O). The patients were classified into the ICP responder and non-responder groups based on whether ICP increment with PEEP adjusted from 3 cmH2O to 15 cmH2O was greater than 20% of baseline ICP. The above parameters were compared between the two groups, and prediction of ICP responsiveness to PEEP adjustment was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

   RESULTS: Compared with the non-responder group, the responder group had lower PICGap (1.63 +/- 1.33 versus 6.56 +/- 2.46 mmHg; p < 0.001), lower baseline ICP, and higher baseline CVP. ROC curve analysis suggested that PICGap was a stronger predictive indicator of ICP responsiveness to PEEP (AUC = 0.957, 95%CI 0.918-0.996; p < 0.001) compared with baseline ICP and baseline CVP, with favorable sensitivity (95.24, 95%CI 86.91-98.70%) and specificity (87.6, 95%CI 75.76-94.27%), at a cut off value of 2.5 mmHg.

   CONCLUSION: The impact of PEEP on ICP depends on the gap between baseline ICP and baseline CVP, i.e. PICGap. In addition, PICGap is a potential predictor of ICP responsiveness to PEEP adjustment in patients with sTBI.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Cerebral blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a major neuroprognostic factor although not clinically feasible for routine assessment and monitoring. In this context, a surrogate marker for cerebral perfusion during CPR is highly desirable. Yet, cerebral blood flow hemodynamic determinants remain poorly understood and their significance might be altered by changes in head positioning such as flat, head up, and head down during CPR.

   HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that routinely measured hemodynamic parameters would correlate with cerebral brain flow during CPR, independently of the head position.

   METHODS: Associations between cerebral blood flow, measured using microsphere techniques, and hemodynamic parameters were studied from two prior publications. Eight pigs receiving CPR with an automated device and an impedance threshold device in the flat or supine, whole body head down and whole body head up tilt positions were analysed for the derivation sample. Relevant associations were examined for consistency in an external validation sample consisting of 18 pigs randomized to supine position versus head and torso elevation.

   RESULTS: After adjusting for position, arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure during decompression were significantly associated with cerebral blood flow, in the derivation and the external validation samples. No significant associations were found between cerebral blood flow during CPR and right atrial pressure, intracranial pressure, end tidal CO2, carotid blood flow, and coronary perfusion pressure in the derivation sample.

   CONCLUSION: Decompression arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure are relevant candidate surrogate markers for cerebral blood flow during CPR, independently of head position. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Importance: The study of health conditions associated with papilledema will augment the clinical judgment of eye care professionals treating patients with optic disc edema in determining the urgency of additional evaluation and counseling patients accordingly.

   Objectives: To determine the incidence, demographic characteristics, and etiologies of papilledema based on a unique records-linkage research platform; and to describe the demographic and clinical differences between patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and other causes of papilledema.

   Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective population-based cross-sectional study of patients treated for papilledema at outpatient eye clinics in Olmsted County, Minnesota, using the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Data were collected from January 1990 to December 2014 and analyzed from September 2018 to April 2019.

   Main Outcomes and Measures: Etiologies of papilledema, body mass index, incidence of headache, or localizing neurologic signs.

   Results: Eighty-six patients were diagnosed with papilledema during the 24-year period, providing an age- and sex-adjusted incidence of 2.5 individuals per 100000 per year; 68 patients (79%) were women, 73 (85%) were white patients, and the median (range) age was 27.7 (6.2-64.2) years. Nineteen patients (22%) presented with a previously diagnosed attributable cause (eg, trauma or intracranial tumor). Among patients presenting with papilledema without a previously diagnosed attributable cause, 58 patients (87%) had IIH, and 9 patients (13%) were found to have a secondary cause of raised intracranial pressure, such as intracranial tumor, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or granulomatous meningitis. Patients with IIH had a higher median (range) body mass index (37.5 [20.4-55.7] vs 27.4 [16.6-40.1]; P = .003) and headache prevalence (54 of 58 patients [93%] vs 6 of 9 patients [67%]; P = .004) than patients with other causes of papilledema. Of 9 patients with papilledema but no IIH, 2 (22%) had localizing neurologic signs, such as gait abnormalities, hearing loss, focal weakness or numbness, visual field defects, or aphasia. Among 42 patients with demographic characteristics typically associated with IIH (female sex, with obesity, aged 15 to 45 years, and absent localizing neurologic signs or symptoms), 40 (95%) had papilledema that was associated with IIH. Conversely, among the 19 patients without these demographic characteristics, 7 (37%) had an alternative cause.

   Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, most patients who presented to the eye clinic with papilledema without a previously known cause were found to have IIH. These patients were more likely to present with headaches and had statistically higher body mass index. Clinicians should take these findings into account when determining the pretest probability of a patient having IIH or an alternative cause of papilledema.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We describe three rare cases of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) presenting with symptoms of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) and perform a literature review to bring attention to a rare link between SIH and EH.

   PATIENT: A 59-year-old female presented with postural headache, aural fullness, vertigo, hearing loss, and abnormal electrocochleography after being diagnosed with SIH by magnetic resonance imaging. The site of cerebrospinal fluid leak was identified in this individual. Two additional patients with vertigo, hearing loss, and SIH were identified by retrospective chart review.

   INTERVENTION: All patients underwent blood patches. One patient also had diuretic treatment while another had fibrin glue injection.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes of interest were resolution of headache, vertigo, aural fullness, and hearing loss.

   RESULTS: All patients eventually improved with time. Literature review suggests that overall outcome is excellent.

   CONCLUSIONS: SIH may be an under-recognized cause of EH. We support the theory that negative intracranial pressure transmitted through the cochlear aqueduct and perilymph leads to EH. Despite the variations in treatments, the overall prognosis is excellent.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Central venous obstruction (stenosis or occlusion) is common in patients with renal failure on hemodialysis and may be associated with intracranial hypertension (IH). Causes include vein injury from an endoluminal device, lumen obstruction from a device or thrombus, external vein compression, and high venous flow leading to vein intimal hyperplasia. A combination of high venous flow and central venous obstruction can lead to intracranial venous hypertension, impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption, and subsequent IH.

   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We conducted a search of the English literature using the Ovid MEDLINE Database and PubMed, with a focus on reports involving IH and central venous obstruction in the setting of hemodialysis. We reviewed CSF flow dynamics, the risk factors and causes of central venous obstruction, and the evaluation, management, and outcomes of central venous obstruction-induced IH.

   RESULTS: Twenty-four cases of IH related to central venous obstruction in hemodialysis patients were identified. Twenty patients had headaches (83.3%) and 9 had visual symptoms (37.5%). The brachiocephalic vein was the most common site of stenosis or occlusion (20/24, 83.3%). Twenty-one patients (87.5%) had resolution of IH with treatment. Two patients died from complications of IH (8.3%).

   CONCLUSIONS: Central venous obstruction-induced IH is likely underrecognized by clinicians and mimics idiopathic IH. Hemodialysis patients with IH should be screened with computed tomography venography of the chest. Optimal treatment is with vascular intervention or a CSF diversion procedure and can help prevent vision loss from papilledema or nervous system damage. Medical management may be appropriate in mild cases or as a bridge to definitive interventional treatment. Increased awareness among clinicians has potential to facilitate the timely diagnosis of this treatable condition with potential for good neurologic and visual outcomes.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Intrathoracic pressure regulation (ITPR) can be utilized to enhance venous return and cardiac preload by inducing negative end expiratory pressure in mechanically ventilated patients. Previous preclinical studies have shown increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and decreased intracranial pressure (ICP) with use of an ITPR device. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic and respiratory effects of ITPR in a porcine polytrauma model of hemorrhagic shock and acute lung injury (ALI).

   METHODS: Swine were anesthetized and underwent a combination of sham, hemorrhage, and/or lung injury. The experimental groups included: no injury with and without ITPR (ITPR, Sham), hemorrhage with and without ITPR (ITPR/Hem, Hem), and hemorrhage and ALI with and without ITPR (ITPR/Hem/ALI, Hem/ALI). The ITPR device was initiated at a setting of -3 cmH2O and incrementally decreased by 3 cmH2O after 30 minutes on each setting, with 15 minutes allowed for recovery between settings, to a nadir of -12 cmH2O. Histopathological analysis of the lungs was scored by blinded, independent reviewers. Of note, all animals were chemically paralyzed for the experiments to suppress gasping at ITPR pressures below -6 cmH2O.

   RESULTS: Adequate shock was induced in the hemorrhage model, with the MAP being decreased in the Hem and ITPR/Hem group compared with Sham and ITPR/Sham, respectively, at all time points (Hem 54.2 +/- 6.5 mmHg vs. 88.0 +/- 13.9 mmHg, p < 0.01, -12 cmH2O; ITPR/Hem 59.5 +/- 14.4 mmHg vs. 86.7 +/- 12.1 mmHg, p < 0.01, -12 cmH2O). In addition, the PaO2/FIO2 ratio was appropriately decreased in Hem/ALI compared with Sham and Hem groups (231.6 +/- 152.5 vs. 502.0 +/- 24.6 (Sham) p < 0.05 vs. 463.6 +/- 10.2, (Hem) p < 0.01, -12 cmH2O). Heart rate was consistently higher in the ITPR/Hem/ALI group compared with the Hem/ALI group (255 +/- 26 bpm vs. 150.6 +/- 62.3 bpm, -12 cmH2O) and higher in the ITPR/Hem group compared with Hem. Respiratory rate (adjusted to maintain pH) was also higher in the ITPR/Hem/ALI group compared with Hem/ALI at -9 and - 12 cmH2O (32.8 +/- 3.0 breaths per minute (bpm) vs. 26.8 +/- 3.6 bpm, -12 cmH2O) and higher in the ITPR/Hem group compared with Hem at -6, -9, and - 12 cmH2O. Lung compliance and end expiratory lung volume (EELV) were both consistently decreased in all three ITPR groups compared with their controls. Histopathologic severity of lung injury was worse in the ITPR and ALI groups compared with their respective injured controls or Sham.

   CONCLUSION: In this swine polytrauma model, we demonstrated successful establishment of hemorrhage and combined hemorrhage/ALI models. While ITPR did not demonstrate a benefit for MAP or ICP, our data demonstrate that the ITPR device induced tachycardia with associated increase in cardiac output, as well as tachypnea with decreased lung compliance, EELV, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and worse histopathologic lung injury. Therefore, implementation of the ITPR device in the setting of polytrauma may compromise pulmonary function without significant hemodynamic improvement. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Symptomatic or active hydrocephalus in children is linked to an elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP), which is likely to be multifactorial in origin. The CSF outflow resistance, venous sinus resistance and total cerebral blood flow are likely factors in the ICP elevation. The purpose of this paper is to define the incidence, site and significance of venous sinus stenosis and/or cerebral hyperemia in a cohort of children diagnosed with hydrocephalus at a tertiary referral hospital.

   METHODS: The imaging database was reviewed over a 10 year period and the index MRI of all children between the ages of 4 months and 15 years, who were diagnosed with treatment naive hydrocephalus of any type (excluding secondary to tumor) and had magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and flow quantification were selected. Patients were compared with children undergoing an MRI with MRV and flow quantification who were subsequently shown to have no abnormality. The cross-sectional area and circumference of the sinuses were measured at 4 levels. The hydraulic and effective diameters were calculated. An area stenosis of 65% or greater was deemed significant. A total cerebral blood flow greater than two standard deviations above the mean for controls was taken to be abnormal.

   RESULTS: There were a total of 55 children with hydrocephalus compared to 118 age matched control MRV's and 35 control flow quantification studies. A high grade stenosis occurred in 56% of patients but in none of the controls (p < 0.0001). The commonest site of narrowing was in the distal sigmoid sinus. Cerebral hyperemia occurred in 13% of patients but did not occur in the controls.

   CONCLUSIONS: The elevation in ICP in symptomatic hydrocephalus is multifactorial. Both high grade venous stenosis and cerebral hyperemia are common in childhood hydrocephalus. High grade stenosis was noted to be a risk factor for conservative management failure. Hyperemia was a good prognostic indicator.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) was linked to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) attributable to the combined effects of microgravity and environmental conditions encountered during spaceflight. Microgravity countermeasures as lower body negative pressure (LBNP) are potential interventions for SANS. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive qualitative analysis of literature contrasting simulation and spaceflight studies, focusing on the pathophysiology of SANS, and highlighting gaps in current knowledge.

   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We systematically searched PubMed electronic database for English primary research published until February 2019 discussing intracranial changes in spaceflight or simulated microgravity, excluding animal and experimental studies. Two authors screened all the abstracts with a third author resolving disagreements. The full-text manuscripts were analyzed in pilot-tested tables.

   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Nineteen studies were reviewed; 13 simulation, and two out of six spaceflight studies were prospective. ICP changes were investigated in 11 simulation studies, where eight demonstrated a significant increase in ICP after variable periods of head-down tilt. three showed a significant increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) in conjunction with ICP elevation. With increasing ambient CO2: one showed an increase in IOP without further increase in ICP, while another showed a slight further decrease in ICP. LBNP demonstrated no significant effect on ICP in one and a decrease thereof in another study. After spaceflight, increased ICP on lumbar puncture was demonstrated in five studies.

   CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to microgravity increases ICP possibly precipitating ocular changes. Whether other factors come into play is the subject of investigation. Further randomized studies and methods of direct ICP measurement during spaceflight are needed.

Abstract
  The physiology underlying the intracranial pressure (ICP) curve morphology is not fully understood. Recent research has suggested that the morphology could be dependent on arterial cerebral inflow and the physiological and pathophysiological properties of the intracranial cavity. If understood, the ICP curve could provide information about the patient's cerebrovascular state important in individualizing treatment in neuro intensive care patients. A mathematical model based on known physiological properties of the intracranial compartment was created. Clinical measurements from ten neuro intensive care patients in whom intracranial arterial blood inflow, venous blood outflow and cerebrospinal fluid flow over the foramen magnum had been measured with phase contrast MRI, concomitant with ICP measurements were used to validate the model. In nine patients the mathematical model was able to create an ICP curve mimicking the measured by using arterial intracranial inflow and adjusting physiological parameters of the model. The venous outflow and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow over the foramen magnum predicted by the model were within physiologically reasonable limits and in most cases followed the MRI measured values in close adjunct. The presented model could produce an ICP curve in close resemblance of the in vivo measured curves. This strengthens the hypothesis that the ICP curve is shaped by the arterial intracranial inflow and the physiological properties of the intracranial cavity.

Abstract
  Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and control is a cornerstone of neuroanesthesia and neurocritical care. However, because elevated ICP can be due to multiple pathophysiological processes, its interpretation is not straightforward. We propose a formal taxonomy of intracranial hypertension, which defines ICP elevations into 3 major pathophysiological subsets: increased cerebral blood volume, masses and edema, and hydrocephalus. (1) Increased cerebral blood volume increases ICP and arises secondary to arterial or venous hypervolemia. Arterial hypervolemia is produced by autoregulated or dysregulated vasodilation, both of which are importantly and disparately affected by systemic blood pressure. Dysregulated vasodilation tends to be worsened by arterial hypertension. In contrast, autoregulated vasodilation contributes to intracranial hypertension during decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure that occur within the normal range of cerebral autoregulation. Venous hypervolemia is produced by Starling resistor outflow obstruction, venous occlusion, and very high extracranial venous pressure. Starling resistor outflow obstruction tends to arise when cerebrospinal fluid pressure causes venous compression to thus increase tissue pressure and worsen tissue edema (and ICP elevation), producing a positive feedback ICP cycle. (2) Masses and edema are conditions that increase brain tissue volume and ICP, causing both vascular compression and decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure leading to oligemia. Brain edema is either vasogenic or cytotoxic, each with disparate causes and often linked to cerebral blood flow or blood volume abnormalities. Masses may arise from hematoma or neoplasia. (3) Hydrocephalus can also increase ICP, and is either communicating or noncommunicating. Further research is warranted to ascertain whether ICP therapy should be tailored to these physiological subsets of intracranial hypertension.

Abstract
  Negative intrathoracic pressure (nITP) is generated by the respiratory muscles during inspiration to overcome inspiratory resistance, thus enabling lung ventilation. Recently developed noninvasive techniques have made it possible to assess the effects of nITP in real time in several physiological aspects such as systemic blood pressure (BP), intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral blood flow (CBF). It has been shown that nITP from 0 to -20 cmH2O elevates BP and diminishes ICP, which facilitates brain perfusion. The effects of nITP from -20 to -40 cmH2O on BP, ICP, and CBF remain largely unrecognized, yet even nITP at -40 cmH2O may facilitate CBF by diminishing ICP. Importantly, nITP from -20 to -40 cmH2O has been documented in adults in commonly encountered obstructive sleep apnea, which justifies research in this area. Recent revelations about interactions between ICP and BP have opened up new fields of research in physiological regulation and the pathophysiology of common diseases, such as hypertension, brain injury, and respiratory disorders. A better understanding of these interactions may translate directly into new therapies in various fields of clinical medicine.

Abstract
  Studies investigating mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) in the military population using experimental head surrogates and Finite Element (FE) head models have demonstrated the existence of transient negative pressures occurring within the head at the contrecoup location to the blast wave impingement. It has been hypothesized that this negative pressure may cause cavitation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and possibly lead to brain tissue damage from cavitation bubble collapse. The cavitation pressure threshold of human CSF is presently unknown, although existing FE studies in the literature have assumed a value of -100 kPa. In the present study, the cavitation threshold of degassed porcine CSF at body temperature (37degreeC) was measured using a unique modified Polymeric Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus, and compared to thresholds of distilled water at various conditions. The loading pulse generated in the apparatus was comparable to experimentally measured pressures resulting from blast exposure, and those predicted by an FE model. The occurrence of cavitation was identified using high-speed imaging and the corresponding pressures were determined using a computational model of the apparatus that was previously developed and validated. The probability of cavitation was calculated (ISO/TS, 18506) from forty-one experimental tests on porcine CSF, representing an upper bound for in vivo CSF. The 50% probability of cavitation for CSF (-0.467MPa+/-7%) was lower than that of distilled water (-1.37MPa+/-16%) under the same conditions. The lesser threshold of CSF could be related to the constituents such as blood cells and proteins. The results of this study can be used to inform FE head models subjected to blast exposure and improve prediction of the potential for CSF cavitation and response of brain tissue. Copyright © 2019.

Abstract
  Open-angle glaucoma, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and Meniere's disease are disorders managed by different specialties in medicine viz. ophthalmology, neurology, and otorhinolaryngology respectively. By working in silos, the similarity of these disorders is overlooked. Close inspection of these disorders reveals the presence of signs and symptoms triggered by fluid under high pressure within relatively closed chambers. There is a similarity in the capillary production of fluid, which then circulates and drains into the venous system. Management practices that reduce fluid production, decrease fluid pressure or enhance fluid drainage are employed for the treatment of all three disorders. A search for a unifying mechanism explaining the pathophysiology of all three disorders may unlock effective and perhaps curative measures for these disorders. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Styloidogenic jugular venous compression syndrome (SJVCS) is a rare cause of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

   OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the pathophysiology and the hemodynamics of SJVCS.

   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records, clinical images, dynamic venography, and manometry for consecutive patients with SJVCS undergoing microsurgical decompression from April 2009 to October 2017. Patients with IIH with normal venography and manometry findings served as controls.

   RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 10 patients with SJVCS who presented with headaches. Neck flexion exacerbated headaches in 7 patients. Eleven patients with IIH provided control data for normal intracranial venous pressure and styloid process anatomy. Patients with SJVCS had bilateral osseous compression of venous outflow. The styloid processes were significantly longer in patients with SJVCS than in those with IIH (mean [standard deviation (SD)] distance, 31.0 [10.6] vs 19.0 [14.1] mm; P < .01). The styloid process-C1 lateral tubercle distance was shorter in patients with SJVCS than in those with IIH (mean [SD] distance, 2.9 [1.0] vs 9.9 [2.8] mm; P < .01). Patients with SJVCS had significantly higher global venous pressure and a higher pressure gradient across the stenosis site than controls (mean [SD] pressure, 2.86 [2.61] vs 0.13 [1.09] cm H2O; P = .09). All 10 patients with SJVCS experienced venous pressure elevation during contralateral neck turning (mean [SD] pressure, 4.29 [2.50] cm H2O). All 10 patients with SJVCS underwent transcervical microsurgical decompression, and 9 experienced postoperative improvement or resolution of symptoms. One patient had transient postoperative dysphagia and facial drooping, and another patient reported jaw numbness.

   CONCLUSION: SJVCS is a novel clinical entity causing IIH. Patients should be evaluated with dynamic venography with manometry. Surgical decompression with removal of osseous overgrowth is an effective treatment in select patients. Copyright © 2019 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Internal jugular vein stenosis (IJVS) results in poor venous outflow and can result in intracranial hypertension. Venous stenting has become a debated topic for correction of this pathology.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old male merchant with bilateral IJVS presented with headache, dizziness, and pulsatile tinnitus. He was found to have intracranial hypertension and left IJVS caused by styloid process compression and right IJVS caused by damage of the venous intima. His symptoms improved after undergoing styloidectomy followed by left intra-internal jugular vein (IJV) balloon. However, 1 year later, the prior symptoms reoccurred. At this time, the patient underwent right intra-IJV stenting. After treatment of the contralateral side, the symptoms resolved during the following 3 months.

   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical practice in this case indicated that in patients with bilateral IJVS, a 2-side intervention may be necessary when unilateral correction fails. We advise a staged approach to correction of bilateral IJVS. Styloid compression-induced IJVS should be corrected by styloidectomy in combination with balloon and/or stenting, whereas IJVS induced by venous wall issues needs only stenting.

Abstract
  OBJECT: The purpose of this work is to review the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of hydrocephalus in patients with achondroplasia as a guide to its management throughout life.

   METHODS: A review of the literature related to neurosurgical issues in achondroplasia with specific focus on cerebrospinal fluid physics, clinical management, and outcome of affected individuals. Issues involved in this review are highlighted by a case report of a patient shunted for achondroplasia first shunted in infancy and followed for 22 years. Each of the management issues is explored with respect to this patient.

   FINDINGS: Head circumferences in achondroplasia are abnormally large in this condition usually caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid in the cortical subarachnoid space. Increase in ventricular size (hydrocephalus) is not rare but should not be treated unless rapidly progressive or symptomatic. The underlying cause of the abnormalities of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics relates to abnormal venous drainage at the skull base. Patients shunted in infancy for hydrocephalus usually remain dependent on the shunt for life, and crises of high intracranial pressure may occur with no distention of the ventricles.

   CONCLUSIONS: In infants with achondroplasia, large heads and enlarged ventricles without symptoms should be watched initially for progression. If hydrocephalus progresses or if symptoms of intracranial hypertension occur, endoscopic third ventriculostomy can be tried. If shunt is necessary, it should have a high opening pressure and a device to retard siphoning. In the case of recurrent ventricular catheter blockage, it may be necessary to create a communication between the ventricles and the cortical subarachnoid space.

Abstract
  The objective of this minireview is to describe the physiology and potential clinical benefits derived from inspiration. Recent animal and clinical studies demonstrate that one of the body's natural mechanisms associated with inspiration is to harness the respiratory pump to enhance circulation to vital organs. There is evidence that large reductions in intrathoracic pressure (>20 cmH2O) caused by some inspiration maneuvers (e.g., Mueller maneuver) or pathophysiology (e.g., heart failure, chronic obstructive lung disease) can result in adverse hemodynamic effects. However, the respiratory pump can improve cardiovascular functions when a "sweet spot" for generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration can be maintained at or less than 10 cmH2O below normal inspiration. These beneficial physiological effects include greater cardiac filling and output, lower intracranial pressure, cardiac baroreflex resetting, greater cerebral blood flow oscillatory patterns, increased vascular pressure gradients, and promoting sustained feedback between sympathetic nerve activity and arterial pressure. In addition to promoting gas exchange, data obtained from numerous animal and human experiments have provided new insights into "the other side of breathing": the modulation of circulation by reduced intrathoracic pressure generated during inspiration. The translation of these physiological relationships form the basis for the development and application of technologies designed to optimize the intrathoracic pump for treatment of clinical conditions associated with hypovolemia including cardiac arrest, orthostatic hypotension, hemorrhagic shock, and traumatic brain injury. Harnessing these fundamental mechanisms that control cardiopulmonary physiology provides opportunities to use inspiration as a potential tool to help treat significant and often life-threatening circulatory disorders.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a major complication after head injury. Impaired venous outflow caused by CVST leads to increased intracranial pressure (IICP) refractory to medications and surgical decompression and often results in devastating consequences. Currently, there is no consensus on the treatment strategy.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we report a case of posttraumatic CVST in a young male motorcyclist involved in a high-speed traffic accident. On admission, the patient immediately underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy. However, refractory malignant IICP developed within 24 hours after the operation. Computed tomography venography revealed compression of the right sigmoid sinus by the fractured temporal bone and extensive thrombosis toward the jugular bulb. Dural sinus thrombectomy and stenting were performed accordingly. After the procedure, IICP was alleviated immediately and the sedatives and medications were tapered off within days. The patient gradually recovered from deep comatose status and underwent cranioplasty 5 weeks later. Finally, the patient was discharged with only mild left wrist weakness.

   CONCLUSIONS: Acute cerebral sinus thrombosis caused by trauma may result in malignant IICP refractory to medications and surgical decompression. We have demonstrated that endovascular angioplasty and sinus stenting are effective in restoring venous outflow and reducing intracranial pressure. We have also demonstrated that appropriate and timely interventions are important to ensure quick and good recovery in patients with CVST. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a common type of stroke in young adults and associated with 8% mortality. High intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain herniation are the most common causes of death in these patients. In contrast with malignant arterial middle cerebral infarction, there are few studies reporting the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy (DC) for treatment of high ICP in patients with CVT. In this study, we assess the clinical outcome of patients with CVT with impending brain herniation treated with DC versus medical management.

   METHODS: In this retrospective study, medical records of all patients with CVT admitted to our hospital were reviewed. Patients with the following inclusion criteria were entered into the study: 1) CVT proven by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venogram and/or computed tomography venogram, 2) malignant CVT (impending brain herniation according to imaging and clinical finding), and 3) age between 16 and 80 years. Patients with deep venous system thrombosis, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, and bilateral nonreactive midposition pupils or mydriasis on admission were excluded. Patients were classified into 2 groups: surgical group (DC group) including patients who received medical treatment and DC and medical group (MG) including patients who received only medical treatment. Outcomes and complications were assessed and compared between the 2 groups.

   RESULTS: Of 357 patients with CVT hospitalized in our center, 48 patients entered into the study. Twenty-three patients were managed medically, and 25 patients were managed surgically. There was no significant difference between the groups concerning age, sex, presenting symptoms, transient and permanent risk factors of CVT, GCS score on admission, and pupils' reactivity on admission. All patients in the MG died during hospitalization in comparison with 8 patients in the DC group (100% vs. 32%, P < 0.001). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score 0-2) was achieved in 52% of the DC group and 0% of the MG group (P < 0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study confirmed that in contrast with DC, medical treatment could not prevent transtentorial herniation. DC is not only lifesaving for patients with CVT with impending brain herniation but also results in favorable outcome in most patients. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Importance: Astronauts on International Space Station missions demonstrate adverse neuro-ocular changes. Reversing a negative translaminar pressure gradient (TLPG) by modulating cerebral blood flow, decreasing intracranial pressure, or increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) has been proposed as potential intervention for spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS).

   Objective: To examine whether exercise (resistance, moderate-intensity aerobic, and high-intensity aerobic) or artificially increasing IOP is associated with modulated cerebro-ocular hemodynamic and pressure changes during head-down tilt (HDT), an analogue of spaceflight, in healthy adults.

   Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-center investigation was conducted at Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, in 20 healthy men.

   Exposure: On 3 separate days, participants rested supine, were tilted to -15degree HDT, and then completed 1 of 3 experimental exercise conditions (moderate-intensity aerobic, resistance, or high-intensity interval aerobic). A subset of 10 participants wore swimming goggles on all days.

   Main Outcomes and Measures: Applanation rebound tonometry was used to noninvasively assess IOP, and compression sonography was used to assess internal jugular venous pressure (IJVP). Estimated TLPG was calculated as the difference between IOP and IJVP. Cerebral inflow and outflow were measured in extracranial arteries using color-coded duplex ultrasonography.

   Results: Twenty men participated in the study (mean [SD] age, 36 [9] years). Compared with supine IOP (mean [SD], 19.3 [3.7] mm Hg), IJVP (mean [SD], 21.4 [6.0] mm Hg), and estimated TLPG (mean [SD], -2.1 [7.0] mm Hg), -15degree HDT was associated with increased IOP (mean difference, 2.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.4-3.3 mm Hg; P < .001) and IJVP (mean difference, 10.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, 8.9-12.2 mm Hg; P < .001) and with decreased TLPG (mean difference, -8.2 mm Hg; 95% CI, -10.1 to -6.3 mm Hg; P < .001). Exercise (regardless of modality) at -15degree HDT was associated with decreased IOP (mean difference, -1.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, -2.6 to -0.6 mm Hg; P = .002) and TLPG (mean difference, -3.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.2 to -0.7 mm Hg; P = .01) compared with rest. Both IOP (mean difference, 2.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.7-5.1 mm Hg; P = .01) and TLPG (mean difference, 5.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.8-9.4 mm Hg; P = .02) were higher in participants who wore swimming goggles compared with those not wearing goggles.

   Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, exercise was associated with decreased IOP and estimated translaminar pressure gradient in a spaceflight analogue of HDT. The addition of swimming goggles was associated with increased IOP and TLPG in HDT. Further evaluation in spaceflight may be warranted to determine whether modestly increasing IOP is an effective SANS countermeasure.

Abstract
  Vacuum erection device (VED), used to treat radical prostatectomy (RP)-associated erectile dysfunction, has attracted considerable attention. However, the optimal negative pressure remains to be determined. This investigation explored the optimal pressure for VED therapy in penile rehabilitation. Thirty-six 9-week-old male rats were randomly divided into six groups: control groups (sham group, bilateral cavernous nerve crush [BCNC] group) and VED therapy groups (-200 mmHg group, -300 mmHg group, -400 mmHg group, -500 mmHg group). BCNC group and VED therapy groups underwent BCNC surgery. Intracavernosal pressure (ICP)/mean arterial pressure (MAP) ratio was calculated to assess erectile function. Masson's trichrome (MT) staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed to explore cellular and molecular changes of the penis. Compared to the BCNC group, ICP/MAP ratios in all VED treatment groups were improved significantly (all P < 0.05), but there were no statistically significant differences among VED therapy groups. With increased pressure, complications gradually emerged and increased in frequency. Expression of molecular indicators, such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), increased after VED therapy, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) decreased. In addition, VED therapy improved the outcomes of MT and TUNEL assay. This investigation demonstrated a pressure of -200 mmHg in a rat model is optimal for VED therapy for penile rehabilitation after RP. No further benefits were observed with increased pressure, despite an increase in complications.

Abstract
  Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is a physiological parameter that has gained considerable attention during the last few decades. The incidence of complications arising from increased IAP, known as intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome in critically ill patients, is high and its impact is significant. The effects of IAP in neurological conditions and during surgical procedures are largely unexplored. IAP also appears to be relevant during neurosurgical procedures (spine and brain) in the prone position, and in selected cases, IAH may affect cerebrospinal fluid drainage after a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation. Furthermore, raised IAP is one of the contributors to intracranial hypertension in patients with morbid obesity. In traumatic brain injury, case reports described how abdominal decompression lowers intracerebral pressure. The anatomical substrate for transmission of the IAP to the brain and venous system of the spine is the extradural neural axis compartment; the first reports of this phenomenon can be found in anatomical studies of the sixteenth century. In this review, we summarize the available knowledge on how IAP impacts the cerebrospinal venous system and the jugular venous system via two pathways, and we discuss the implications for neurosurgical procedures as well as the relevance of IAH in neurological disorders.

Abstract
  Available evidences suggest that a number of known assumption on idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with or without papilledema might be discussed. These include (1) the primary pathogenetic role of an excessive dural sinus collapsibility in IIH, allowing a new relatively stable intracranial fluids pressure balance at higher values; (2) the non-mandatory role of papilledema for a definite diagnosis; (3) the possibly much higher prevalence of IIH without papilledema than currently considered; (4) the crucial role of the cerebral compliance exhaustion that precede the raise in intracranial pressure and that may already be pathologic in cases showing a moderately elevated opening pressure; (5) the role as "intracranial pressure sensor" played by the trigeminovascular innervation of dural sinuses and cortical bridge veins, which could represent a major source of CGRP and may explain the high comorbidity and the emerging causative link between IIHWOP and chronic migraine (CM). Accordingly, the control of intracranial pressure is to be considered a promising new therapeutic target in CM.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Remote cerebellar hemorrhage (RCH) after intracranial surgery is a rare complication. Cerebellar hemorrhage is the most commonly described remote site hemorrhage after surgery for supratentorial pathologies. Although this is a rare complication 0.04% to 0.8%, it can be devastating in terms of patient outcome. There are various hypotheses to explain the occurrence of RCH. We report 6 cases of RCH after surgery for supratentorial lesions, discuss the pathophysiology, and review the pertinent literature.

   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of patients who underwent surgery for supratentorial lesions at our center between 2015 and 2017. We identified 6 patients who developed RCH among 1200 patients who underwent surgery and reviewed the demographic data, diagnosis, surgical procedure, and final outcome.

   RESULTS: A total of 1200 patients underwent surgery for supratentorial pathologies between 2015 and 2017. Six patients developed RCH (incidence, 0.5%); 5 were male and 1 was female, with a mean age of 46.4 years. One patient underwent suboccipital decompression for RCH; the rest 5 were managed with close observation and serial imaging. The Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) of 5 was observed in 4 patients, GOS of 4 in 1 patient at discharge, and GOS of 1 in 1 patient who succumbed to severe pulmonary infection after surgery.

   CONCLUSIONS: RCH is a rare complication but can lead to catastrophic results. Loss of large volumes of cerebrospinal fluid or sudden alteration in intracranial pressure due to removal of a mass lesion is the likely etiology. Although majority of cases may be managed conservatively, in a subset of cases with neurologic deterioration, surgery may be required as a life-saving procedure. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral Venous Sinus Stenosis (CVSS) usually results in severe Intracranial Hypertension (IH), which can be corrected by stenting immediately. However, there is a lack of evidence of the long-term good outcomes in patients with CVSS who underwent stenting.

   METHODS: A total of 62 patients with imaging confirmed non-thrombotic and non-external compression CVSS were enrolled into this single center real-world cohort study after undergoing stenting, and were continuously followed up for more than 12 years. The symptoms and signs of IH prior to stenting and post-stenting and the incidence of restenosis after stenting were analyzed.

   RESULTS: The mean age of the 62 patients (range, 13 to 62) was 40 years old, and the mean body mass index was 26 (range 23 to 40). Females accounted for 67.7% (42/62). Headache was the most common symptom (79%). Transient visual obscurations occurred in 69% of the patients. 42% of the patients suffered from visual loss, 11.3% pulsatile tinnitus, and 96.8% Papilledema before stenting. The mean trans-stenotic pressure gradients were 6~43 mmHg prior to stenting and returned to 0~4 mmHg after stent placement. During the following 12~126 months (the median was 62) after stenting of the follow-up, 91.9% (57/62) of the patients obtained good outcomes. Headaches disappeared in 96% (47/49) of the patients and papilledema was attenuated in 98.3% (59/60). However, There were still 8.0 % (5/62) of the patients with poor outcomes, including optic disc atrophy in 3 patients and stent-interior thrombosis in 2 patients, which occurred 6.3 months after stenting.

   CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that stenting may be a promising therapy for CVSS correcting. Patients with CVSS may get long-term benefit from stenting, especially when they are accompanied with severe IH.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Negative-pressure hydrocephalus is a rare condition with the development of symptomatic hydrocephalus despite subnormal intracranial pressure (ICP). The etiology remains unclear. Some authors proposed that the differential pressure between the ventricular space and the subarachnoid space over cerebral convexity leads to the development of ventriculomegaly, namely as the transmantle pressure theory.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old patient with a left Sylvian fissure arachnoid cyst underwent several surgeries including cystoperitoneal shunts and fenestrations of the cyst. The patient developed a cerebrospinal fluid fistula from the cranial wound was complicated by bacterial meningitis. Consequently, the shunt was removed, and external cyst drainage was placed. After 9 days, the patient developed acute hydrocephalus requiring external ventricular drainage (EVD). Two days later, after overdrainage of the external cyst drain, the patient suffered neurologic deterioration. The ICP measured by the EVD was -4 cm H2O, and a computed tomography scan demonstrated progression of the hydrocephalus. The external cyst drainage was shut off and the EVD level was adjusted to produce between 5 and 10 mL/hour of cerebrospinal fluid under a subatmospheric pressure set at -5 cm H2O, and gradually raised in increments of 1 cm every 3 days until a positive ICP occurred. Once clinical and radiographic stability was accomplished, a programmable ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted set to 30 mm H2O. A marked clinical and radiologic improvement was observed in the follow-up.

   CONCLUSIONS: This negative-pressure hydrocephalus case report supports the main role of the transmantle pressure theory. The subatmospheric EVD method and a low-pressure valve resulted in excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Diseases of the cerebral venous system frequently lead to neuro-ophthalmic complications. Cortical venous sinus thrombosis and dural arteriovenous fistulas may be complicated by elevation of intracranial pressure, with secondary papilledema or abducens palsies. There is increasing recognition that stenosis at the transverse sinus-sigmoid sinus junction plays a role in the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and offers a new avenue of treatment in patients who fail medical therapy. Diseases of the cavernous sinus manifest with their own set of neuro-ophthalmic symptoms, reflecting the presence of all 3 ocular motor nerves and the oculosympathetic fibers within its walls, along with its role as the primary drainage pool of the globe and orbit. Numerous questions and controversies remain regarding the diagnosis and optimal treatment of cerebral venous disease, including the role of venous stenting in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, the role of anticoagulation in cavernous sinus thrombosis, and the risks and benefits of embolization of mild indirect cavernous carotid fistulas.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: A narrative review of the pathophysiology linking altered airway pressure and intracranial pressure and cerebral oxygenation.

   DATA SOURCES: Online search of PubMed and manual review of articles (laboratory and patient studies) of the altered airway pressure on intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion, or cerebral oxygenation.

   STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials, observational and physiologic studies.

   DATA EXTRACTION: Our group determined by consensus which resources would best inform this review.

   DATA SYNTHESIS: In the normal brain, positive-pressure ventilation does not significantly alter intracranial pressure, cerebral oxygenation, or perfusion. In injured brains, the impact of airway pressure on intracranial pressure is variable and determined by several factors; a cerebral venous Starling resistor explains much of the variability. Negative-pressure ventilation can improve cerebral perfusion and oxygenation and reduce intracranial pressure in experimental models, but data are limited, and mechanisms and clinical benefit remain uncertain.

   CONCLUSIONS: The effects of airway pressure and ventilation on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation are increasingly understood, especially in the setting of brain injury. In the face of competing mechanisms and priorities, multimodal monitoring and individualized titration will increasingly be required to optimize care.

Abstract
  AIM: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in hypoxic ischaemic brain injury (HIBI) can cause secondary ischaemic brain injury and culminate in brain death. Invasive ICP monitoring is limited by associated risks in HIBI patients. We sought to evaluate the agreement between invasive ICP measurements and non-invasive estimators of ICP (nICP) in HIBI patients.

   METHODS: Eligible consecutive adult (age>18) cardiac arrest patients with HIBI were included as part of a single centre prospective interventional study. Invasive ICP monitoring and nICP measurements were undertaken using: a) transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD), b) optic nerve sheet diameter ultrasound (ONSD) and c) jugular venous bulb pressure (JVP). Multiple measurements applied in linear mixed-effects models were considered to obtain the correlation coefficient between ICP and nICP as well as their predictive abilities to detect intracranial hypertension (ICP>=20mm Hg).

   RESULTS: Eleven patients were included (median age of 47 [range 20-71], 8 males and 3 females). There was a linear relationship between ICP and nICP with ONSD (R=0.53 [p<0.0001]), JVP (R=0.38 [p<0.001]) and TCD (R=0.30 [p<0.01]). The ability to predict intracranial hypertension was highest for ONSD and TCD (area under the receiver operating curve (AUC)=0.96 [95% CI: 0.90-1.00] and AUC=0.91 [95% CI: 0.83-1.00], respectively). JVP presented the weakest prediction ability (AUC=0.75 [95% CI: 0.56-0.94]).

   CONCLUSIONS: ONSD and TCD methods demonstrated agreement with invasively-monitored ICP, suggesting their potential roles in the detection of intracranial hypertension in HIBI after cardiac arrest. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Venous stenting has been proven to be a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS). However, its use in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis-related CVSS has been less reported.

   PURPOSE: To explore the safety and efficacy of stenting for patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST)-related CVSS.

   METHODS: The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with CVST-related CVSS received venous stenting in the chronic stage after failed medical treatment were retrospectively evaluated.

   RESULTS: A total of 17 patients with CVST-related CVSS were included. Mean pressure gradient across the CVSS decreased from 11.5+/-4.2 mmHg prior to stenting to 2.1+/-1.1 mmHg post- stenting. Mean CSF opening pressure decreased from 33.1+/-5.5 cmH2O to 18.7+/-1.7 cmH2O. Both headache and visual disturbance improved or resolved in 78% and 92% of the patients, respectively. Complications included lethal cerebellar hematoma in one case and bilateral occipital epidural hematoma in another case. One of the patients received retreatment with ventriculo-peritoneal shunting due to recurrent headache.

   CONCLUSION: Restoring the patency of stenotic sinuses with stents in patients of CVST-related CVSS unresponsive to medical therapy in the chronic stage may improve symptoms in the majority of the patients. However, a relatively higher cerebral hemorrhage rate was observed and may be related to this pathology. Stenting in this subgroup of CVSS patients may require further evaluation with a larger and long-term study, and should be used with caution at this time.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is strongly associated with central obesity and consequential raised intra-abdominal pressure. If left untreated it poses significant risk to vision and can eventually cause blindness. Owing to its pathophysiology, this condition is managed by both medical and surgical specialities. When medical management fails neurosurgeons commonly treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension by permanent cerebrospinal fluid peritoneal shunting. Weight reduction surgery provides patients who are obese with a multitude of benefits and it is not uncommon for the general surgeon to be presented with a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and a cerebrospinal fluid peritoneal shunt in place. This provides a potential challenging situation in weight-loss surgical procedures. We describe an interesting case where laparoscopic bariatric surgery resulted in transection of the abdominal catheter with a delayed presentation of recurrent symptoms and an abdominal cerebrospinal fluid collection in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. We discuss how this could be avoided and its management.

Abstract
  KEY POINTS: During long-term missions, some astronauts experience structural and functional changes of the eyes and brain which resemble signs/symptoms experienced by patients with intracranial hypertension. Weightlessness prevents the normal cerebral volume and pressure 'unloading' associated with upright postures on Earth, which may be part of the cerebral and ocular pathophysiology. By placing the lower body in a negative pressure device (LBNP) that pulls fluid away from cranial compartments, we simulated effects of gravity and significantly lowered pressure within the brain parenchyma and ventricle compartments. Application of incremental LBNP demonstrated a non-linear dose-response curve, suggesting 20 mmHg LBNP as the optimal level for reducing pressure in the brain without impairing cerebral perfusion pressure. This non-invasive method of reducing pressure in the brain holds potential as a countermeasure in space as well as having treatment potential for patients on Earth with traumatic brain injury or other pathology leading to intracranial hypertension.

   ABSTRACT: Patients with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) exhibit neuro-ocular symptoms including headache, papilloedema and loss of vision. Some of these symptoms are also present in astronauts during and after prolonged space-flight where lack of gravitational stress prevents daily lowering of ICP associated with upright posture. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) simulates the effects of gravity by displacing fluid caudally and we hypothesized that LBNP would lower ICP without compromising cerebral perfusion. Ten cerebrally intact volunteers were included: six ambulatory neurosurgical patients with parenchymal ICP-sensors and four former cancer patients with Ommaya-reservoirs to the frontal horn of a lateral ventricle. We applied LBNP while recording ICP and blood pressure while supine, and during simulated intracranial hypertension by 15degree head-down tilt. LBNP from 0 to 50 mmHg at increments of 10 mmHg lowered ICP in a non-linear dose-dependent fashion; when supine (n = 10), ICP was decreased from 15 +/- 2 mmHg to 14 +/- 4, 12 +/- 5, 11 +/- 4, 10 +/- 3 and 9 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.0001). Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), calculated as mean arterial blood pressure at midbrain level minus ICP, was unchanged (from 70 +/- 12 mmHg to 67 +/- 9, 69 +/- 10, 70 +/- 12, 72 +/- 13 and 74 +/- 15 mmHg; P = 0.02). A 15degree head-down tilt (n = 6) increased ICP to 26 +/- 4 mmHg, while application of LBNP lowered ICP (to 21 +/- 4, 20 +/- 4, 18 +/- 4, 17 +/- 4 and 17 +/- 4 mmHg; P < 0.0001) and increased CPP (P < 0.01). An LBNP of 20 mmHg may be the optimal level to lower ICP without impairing CPP to counteract spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome in astronauts. Furthermore, LBNP holds clinical potential as a safe, non-invasive method for lowering ICP and improving CPP for patients with pathologically elevated ICP on Earth. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Abstract
  Spontaneous regression of direct carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) is extremely rare. Most of the patients with direct CCFs are usually treated using endovascular techniques. Spontaneous obliteration of the direct fistulas probably results from thrombosis of the venous drainage and/or cavernous sinus. We report spontaneous closure of nine direct CCFs in nine patients. From literature review, we found another 37 patients with 43 fistulas due to spontaneous obliteration of bilateral lesions in six cases. There was no spontaneous closure in large-sized fistula. The factors associated with spontaneous thrombosis of the fistulas may be low-flow and small-sized fistula, hypotension, severe ocular manifestations, dissections or spasm of carotid artery, and increased intracranial pressure. Spontaneous healing of direct traumatic CCFs should be confirmed with cerebral angiography. Conservative treatment of direct CCFs should be carefully restricted in patients with normal vision or minimal visual impairment, and the patients must be monitored closely for any changes in visual function. Prompt endovascular treatment for complete obliteration of the fistula should be performed in patients with rapidly progressive visual loss. Venous thrombosis can still effect vision and rerouting towards cortical veins remains a concern. Because spontaneous resolution cannot be reliably predicted, the fistula then should be treated rather than waiting for spontaneous thrombosis.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The impact of venous sinus stenting (VSS) on vein of Labbe (VOL) drainage is poorly understood. The purpose of the study is to examine the incidence and potential high risk factors of impaired VOL drainage among idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients following VSS.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approved prospective evaluation of all IIH patients who underwent VSS over a 5 year period (January 2012 to December 2017) at Weill Cornell Medical Center constituted the study population. Patient demographics, procedural details (laterality of stenting, balloon angioplasty, number of stents, and stent diameters), morphology of the VOL and changes in the flow in the VOL, type of sinus stenosis, and transverse sinus symmetry were evaluated. We used chi2 analysis to evaluate impaired VOL drainage against other variables. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.

   RESULTS: 70 consecutive patients (67 women, 3 men) with a mean age of 31+/-9.8 years underwent VSS. Stenosis was extrinsic in 63% (n=44) and intrinsic in 37% (n=26) of patients. Impaired drainage of the VOL was detected in 9/70 (13%) patients. Ipsilateral VOL was recognized as dominant in 20% (n=14), co-dominant in 51% (n=36), and non-dominant in 29% (n=20) of patients. Impaired VOL drainage was significantly associated with ipsilateral VOL dominance (P=0.001) and stent diameter of >=9 mm (P=0.042). All patients demonstrated widely patent VOL on follow-up contrast enhanced MR venography at 3 months and 24 months.

   CONCLUSION: Impaired drainage of the ipsilateral VOL is a potential consequence of VSS with 13% incidence, and has significant association with ipsilateral superficial cortical venous drainage via dominant VOL and stent diameter of >=9 mm.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Dural venous sinus stenting (DVSS) is an accepted treatment option in selected patients with medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension and obstructive venous outflow physiology prior to cerebrospinal flow diversion (CSFD) surgery. There are no randomized controlled studies focusing on outcomes and complication rates for dural venous sinus stenting.

   PURPOSE: We present the largest comprehensive meta-analysis on DVSS for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) focusing on success rates, complications, and re-stenting rates to date. We also present a simplified approach to direct retrograde internal jugular vein (IJ) access for DVSS that allows for expedited procedures.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective electronic PubMed query of all peer-reviewed articles in the last 15 years between 2003 to 2018. We included all patients who underwent dural venous sinus stenting for a medically refractive IIH and excluded articles without sufficient data on outcomes, complication rates and re-stenting rates. We also evaluated and compared outcomes in patients undergoing direct retrograde IJ access DVSS to traditional transfemoral vein access.

   RESULTS: A total of 29 papers and 410 patients who underwent DVSS met criteria for inclusion. DVSS was associated with high technical success [99.5%], low rates of repeated procedure [10%], and low major complication rates [1.5%].

   CONCLUSION: Our retrospective comprehensive review of DVSS for medically refractory IIH suggests that stenting in appropriately chosen patients is associated with low complication rates, high technical success, and low repeat procedure rates.

Abstract
  AIMS: We report the cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure (CSF-OP) measurements obtained before and after venous sinus stenting (VSS) in 50 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

   METHODS: The CSF-OP was measured with a spinal tap 3 months before and 3 months after treatment. All data were prospectively collected and included patient demographics, weight (kg), body mass index (BMI), acetazolamide daily dosage (mg), procedural details, complications, venous sinus pressures (mm Hg), trans-stenotic pressure gradient (mm Hg), transverse sinus symmetry, and type of venous sinus stenosis.

   RESULTS: The average pretreatment CSF-OP was 37 cm H2O (range 25-77) and the average post-treatment CSF-OP was 20.2 cm H2O (range 10-36), with an average reduction of 16.8 cm H2O (P<0.01). The post-treatment CSF-OP was less than 25 cm H2O in 40/50 patients. The average acetazolamide daily dose decreased from 950 mg to 300 mg at the time of 3-month follow-up (P<0.01). No patient required an increase in acetazolamide dose 3 months after VSS. The average weight before treatment was 95.4 kg with an average BMI of 35.41. There was an average increase in body weight of 1.1 kg at the 3-month follow-up with an average increase in BMI of 0.35 (P=0.03).

   CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that there is a significant decrease in CSF-OP in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension 3 months after VSS, independent of acetazolamide usage or weight loss.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The role of venous sinus stenting (VSS) for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is not well understood. The aim of this systematic review is to attempt to identify subsets of patients with IIH who will benefit from VSS based on the pressure gradients of their venous sinus stenosis.

   METHODS: MEDLINE/PubMed was searched for studies reporting venous pressure gradients across the stenotic segment of the venous sinus, pre- and post-stent pressure gradients, and clinical outcomes after VSS. Findings are reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.

   RESULTS: From 32 eligible studies, a total of 186 patients were included in the analysis. Patients who had favorable outcomes had higher mean pressure gradients (22.8 +/- 11.5 mm Hg vs 17.4 +/- 8.0 mm Hg, p = 0.033) and higher changes in pressure gradients after stent placement (19.4 +/- 10.0 mm Hg vs 12.0 +/- 6.0 mm Hg, p = 0.006) compared with those with unfavorable outcomes. The post-stent pressure gradients between the 2 groups were not significantly different (2.8 +/- 4.0 mm Hg vs 2.7 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, p = 0.934). In a multivariate stepwise logistic regression controlling for age, sex, body mass index, CSF opening pressure, pre-stent pressure gradient, and post-stent pressure gradient, the change in pressure gradient with stent placement was found to be an independent predictor of favorable outcome (p = 0.028). Using a pressure gradient of 21 as a cutoff, 81/86 (94.2%) of patients with a gradient > 21 achieved favorable outcomes, compared with 82/100 (82.0%) of patients with a gradient <= 21 (p = 0.022).

   CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a relationship between the pressure gradient of venous sinus stenosis and the success of VSS in IIH. A randomized controlled trial would help elucidate this relationship and potentially guide patient selection.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Headaches, visual problems and tinnitus are symptoms of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) which resolve with reduction of CSF pressure. Impaired cranial venous outflow has been implicated in the pathogenesis and there is evidence of good treatment results in IIH using venous sinus stenting. We are currently initiating a multi-centre randomised controlled trial, the VISION study (Venous Intervention versus Shunting in IIH for Optic Disc Swelling) comparing radiological (venous sinus stenting) to surgical intervention (CSF shunting). As part of the preparations for VISION we made a basic questionnaire available to members of the website IIH UK ( www.iih.org.uk ).

   METHODS: 10-point questionnaire pertaining to IIH diagnosis, symptoms and management using www.surveymonkey.com .

   RESULTS: 250 questionnaires were returned. 95.6% of respondents were female, mostly <=40 years of age. 70% were diagnosed in the last 5 years, but only 35% were diagnosed less than a year after onset of symptoms. 59.4% of patients had not undergone any radiological/surgical intervention, 34.9% had had CSF diversion, 3.6% venous stenting and 2.0% had stent plus shunt. 16.8% indicated their lives were most affected by tinnitus and 18.1% by visual problems, but 49.6% said they were most affected by their headaches. 81% of patients indicated they would be happy to participate in a randomised trial comparing the two treatment options of venous stenting and CSF shunting.

   CONCLUSION: IIH patients want to be actively involved in their treatment and are favourably disposed towards clinical research. Variation exists in treatment modalities offered. There are individual differences regarding impact of symptoms.

Abstract
  We report the application of a three-dimensional skull model with vascular structures for occipital expansion in a patient who had developed occipital emissary veins. A 15-year-old boy visited a dentist for orthodontic treatment and was diagnosed with midface hypoplasia. He had undergone a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt at the age of 10 months. On visiting our institution, he was diagnosed with exophthalmos, low visual acuity, reversed bite, and developmental retardation. Moreover, he had sleep apnea and was supported with continuous positive airway pressure at night. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated brachycephalus, chronic tonsillar herniation, midface hypoplasia, and well-developed occipital emissary veins. We chose occipital expansion for lowering intracranial pressure and created a three-dimensional skull model with vascular structures and shunt tube. On this model, we wrote scalp incision and craniotomy lines avoiding injury to the veins and shunt tube. The operation was completed using this plan. Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis frequently have developed emissary veins and previous shunt operation. The three-dimensional skull model with vascular structures will be expected to reduce the risks of surgery.

Abstract
  Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is a rare clinical diagnosis, characterized by neurologic decline and ventriculomegaly that persists despite normal to low intracranial pressure. LPH is typically managed by negative-pressure drainage via ventriculostomy, followed by low-resistance shunt insertion. We present the case of a middle-aged man with a history of hemangioblastomatosis who had spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. He was treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and then underwent resection of a Meckel's cave hemangioblastoma and whole brain irradiation. One month later, he presented to us with worsening symptoms and hydrocephalus despite shunt interrogations and revisions revealing no malfunction. Ventriculostomy drainage at negative-pressure was required for resolution of symptoms and ventriculomegaly, leading us to a diagnosis of LPH. This was successfully treated using an improvised ultra-low pressure valveless ventriculoperitoneal shunt, with maintained resolution of LPH for over one year. The system was created by ligating the distal slit valve end of a peritoneal catheter to prevent reflux and allow sub-zero pressure drainage by siphoning. Copyright Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: High signal intensity of cerebral venous sinuses on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) indicates high flow of shunt from arterial blood, suggesting dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF). Herein, we describe the cases of 2 patients with intracranial venous reflux caused by brachiocephalic vein occlusion (BVO) mimicking dAVF on MRA.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1 was a 71-year-old woman who had received arteriovenous graft (AVG) surgery for hemodialysis and presented with headache. MRA depicted high signal intensities in the left jugular vein, inferior petrosal sinus, and ophthalmic vein suggesting intracranial dAVF. However, cerebral angiography revealed intracranial venous reflux through the jugular vein caused by BVO. After balloon angioplasty with stenting for BVO, normal venous drainage was restored and her symptoms resolved. Case 2 was a 62-year-old woman who had received AVG for hemodialysis and was hospitalized due to seizure. MRA revealed high signal intensities of the left transverse-sigmoid sinus and jugular vein, and it was suspected that they were associated with BVO. She did not receive immediate intervention because of her septic condition. The patient ultimately died of fatal intracranial hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

   CONCLUSIONS: Central venous occlusion may occur in patients with end-stage renal disease who are receiving AVG for hemodialysis. Intracranial venous reflux resulting from BVO can induce various neurologic disorders including intracranial venous hypertension or hemorrhage. Prompt recognition and implementation of endovascular treatment can be beneficial in cases of symptomatic central venous occlusion. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Persistent urinary incontinence (UI) and/or erectile dysfunction (ED) occur in 30-50% of post-radical prostatectomy patients regardless of nerve sparing approaches. Identification of potential treatment options for these patients will require testing in an animal model that develops these chronic conditions. The objective was to characterize a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of persistent post-prostatectomy ED and UI and then test the feasibility of periurethral injection of the chemokine CXCL-12.

   METHODS: Ten adult male cynomolgus monkeys were used. Two were used for study of normal male nonhuman primate genitourinary anatomy. Five were used for measures of sexual behavior, peak intra-corporal pressure (ICP), abdominal leak point pressures (ALPP) 3 and 6-months post open radical prostatectomy (ORP). Three additional ORP animals received ultrasound-guided peri-urethral injection of chemokine CXCL12 6 weeks after ORP, and UI/ED evaluated for up to 3 months.

   RESULTS: The anatomy, innervation, and vascular supply to the prostate and surrounding tissues of these male NHPs are substantially similar to those of human beings. ORP resulted in complete removal of the prostate gland along with both neurovascular bundles and seminal vesicles while permitting stable restoration of vesico-urethral patency. ORP produced sustained (6 months) decreases in ALPP, ICP's, and sexual function. Transurethral injection of chemokine CXCL12 was feasible and had beneficial effects on erectile and urinary function.

   CONCLUSIONS: ORP in NHPs produced persistent erectile and urinary tract dysfunction. Periurethral injection of CXCL-12 was feasible and improved both urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction and suggests that this model can be used to test new approaches for both conditions.

Abstract
  A woman in her thirties with intracranial hypertension underwent stenting of the right transverse-sigmoid (TS) junction with resolution of the pressure gradient. Due to persisting symptoms at follow-up, she underwent a repeat study showing a patent right TS stent but the non-dominant left transverse sinus, patent on initial studies, was now completely occluded. According to the positive feedback loop hypothesis, stenting of the right transverse sinus should have resulted in a reduction in intracranial pressures (confirmed by post-stenting lumbar puncture), but also an increase in left transverse sinus diameter, opposed to the occlusion seen on venography. This unexpected finding can be explained by the positive feedback loop hypothesis if a revision is made accounting for intramural venous pressures as an opposing force of venous sinus stenosis, as venous outflow obstruction in the dominant venous sinus pathway provided an increased intramural venous pressure in the non-dominant sinus facilitating patency against extramural pressures.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE Women taking combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) are generally considered to be at low risk for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). When it does occur, however, intensive care and neurosurgical management may, in rare cases, be needed for the control of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). The use of nonsurgical strategies such as barbiturate coma and induced hypothermia has never been reported in this context. The objective of this study is to determine predictive factors for invasive or surgical ICP treatment and the potential complications of nonsurgical strategies in this population. METHODS The authors conducted a 2-center, retrospective chart review of 168 cases of CVT in women between 2000 and 2012. Eligible patients were classified as having had a mild or a severe clinical course, the latter category including all patients who underwent invasive or surgical ICP treatment and all who had an unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score >= 3 or Glasgow Outcome Scale score <= 3). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for continuous parameters and Fisher's exact test for categorical parameters, and odds ratios were calculated with statistical significance set at p <= 0.05. RESULTS Of the 168 patients, 57 (age range 16-49 years) were determined to be eligible for the study. Six patients (10.5%) required invasive or surgical ICP treatment. Three patients (5.3%) developed refractory ICP > 30 mm Hg despite early surgical decompression; 2 of them (3.5%) were treated with barbiturate coma and induced hypothermia, with documented infectious, thromboembolic, and hemorrhagic complications. Coma on admission, thrombosis of the deep venous system with consecutive hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic venous infarction were associated with a higher frequency of surgical intervention. Coma, quadriparesis on admission, and hydrocephalus were more commonly seen among women with unfavorable outcomes. Thrombosis of the transverse sinus was less common in patients with an unfavorable outcome, with similar distribution in patients needing invasive or surgical ICP treatment. CONCLUSIONS The need for invasive or surgical ICP treatment in women taking CHCs who have CVT is partly predictable on the basis of the clinical and radiological findings on admission. The use of nonsurgical treatments for refractory ICP, such as barbiturate coma and induced hypothermia, is associated with systemic infectious and hematological complications and may worsen morbidity in this patient population. The significance of these factors should be studied in larger multicenter cohorts.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a commonly occurring disease, particularly among young women of child-bearing age. The underlying pathophysiology for this disease has remained largely unclear; however, the recent literature suggests that focal outflow obstruction of the transverse sinus may be the cause. The purpose of this study was to report one group's early experience with transverse venous sinus stenting in the treatment of IIH and assess its effectiveness. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective chart review to identify patients who had undergone stenting of an outflow-obstructed transverse venous sinus for the treatment of IIH at Gates Vascular Institute between January 2015 and November 2017. Patient demographic data of interest included age, sex, BMI, and history of smoking, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, hormonal contraceptive use, and acetazolamide therapy. Each patient's presenting signs and symptoms and whether those symptoms improved with treatment were reviewed. The average opening lumbar puncture (LP) pressure preprocedure, average pressure gradient across the obstructed segment prior to stenting, treatment failure rate (need for shunt placement), and mean follow-up period were calculated. RESULTS Of the 18 patients who had undergone transverse venous stenting for IIH, 16 (88.9%) were women. The mean age of all the patients was 38.3 years (median 38 years). Mean BMI was 34.2 kg/m2 (median 33.9 kg/m2). Presenting symptoms were headache (16 patients [88.9%]), visual disturbances (13 patients [72.2%]), papilledema (8 patients [44.4%]), tinnitus (3 patients [16.7%]), and auditory bruit (3 patients [16.7%]). The mean opening LP pressure pre-procedure was 35.6 cm H2O (median 32 cm H2O). The mean pressure gradient measured proximally and distally to the area of focal obstruction within the transverse sinus was 16.5 cm H2O (median 15 cm H2O). Postprocedurally, 14 patients (77.8%) continued to have headaches; 6 (33.3%) continued to have visual disturbances. No patients continued to have auditory bruit (0%) or papilledema (0%). One patient (5.6%) had new-onset tinnitus postprocedure. Overall improvement of symptoms was noted in 16 patients (88.9%) postprocedure, with 1 patient (5.6%) requiring shunt placement and 2 other patients (11.1%) requiring postprocedural LP to monitor intracranial pressure to determine candidacy for further surgical interventions to treat residual symptoms. The mean duration of follow-up was 194.2 days. CONCLUSIONS Transverse sinus stenting is a rapidly developing technique that has shown good effectiveness and safety in the literature. Authors of the present study found that stenting a flow-obstructed transverse sinus in patients with IIH was a safe and effective way to treat the condition.

Abstract
  This paper is a narrative review of extraaxial developmental venous anomalies (eDVAs) of the brain involving dural venous flow or sinuses: persistent embryonic sinuses, sinus pericranii, enlarged emissary veins, and venous varices or aneurysmal malformations. The article highlights the natural history, anatomy, embryology, imaging, clinical implications, and neurosurgical significance of these lesions, which the authors believe represent a continuum, with different entities characterized by distinct embryopathologic features. The indications and surgical management options are discussed for these individual intracranial pathologies with relevant illustrations, and a novel classification is proposed for persistent falcine sinus (PFS). The role of neurointervention and/or microsurgery in specific cases such as sinus pericranii and enlarged emissary veins of the skull is highlighted. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and developmental anatomy of these lesions can reduce treatment morbidity and mortality. Some patients, including those with vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs), can present with the added systemic morbidity of a high-output cardiac failure. Although VOGM is the most studied and classified of the above-mentioned eDVAs, the authors believe that grouping the former with the other venous anomalies/abnormalities listed above would enable the clinician to convey the exact morphophysiological configuration of these lesions, predict their natural history with respect to evolving venous hypertension or stroke, and extrapolate invaluable insights from VOGM treatment to the treatment of other eDVAs. In recent years, many of these symptomatic venous malformations have been treated with endovascular interventions, although these techniques are still being refined. The authors highlight the broad concept of eDVAs and hope that this work will serve as a basis for future studies investigating the role of evolving focal venous hypertension/global intracranial hypertension and possibilities of fetal surgical intervention in these cases.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease defined by elevated intracranial pressure without established etiology. Although there is now consensus on the definition of the disorder, its complex pathophysiology remains elusive. The most common clinical symptoms of IIH include headache and visual complaints. Many current theories regarding the etiology of IIH focus on increased secretion or decreased absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and on cerebral venous outflow obstruction due to venous sinus stenosis. In addition, it has been postulated that obesity plays a role, given its prevalence in this population of patients. Several treatments, including optic nerve sheath fenestration, CSF diversion with ventriculoperitoneal or lumboperitoneal shunts, and more recently venous sinus stenting, have been described for medically refractory IIH. Despite the availability of these treatments, no guidelines or standard management algorithms exist for the treatment of this disorder. In this paper, the authors provide a review of the literature on IIH, its clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and evidence supporting treatment strategies, with a specific focus on the role of venous sinus stenting.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Reducing intrathoracic pressure in the setting of compromised cerebral perfusion due to acute brain injury has been associated with reduced intracranial pressure and enhanced cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow in animals. Noninvasive active intrathoracic pressure regulation lowers intrathoracic pressure, increases preload, reduces the volume of venous blood and cerebral spinal fluid in the skull, and enhances cerebral blood flow. We examined the feasibility of active intrathoracic pressure regulation therapy in patients with brain injury. We hypothesized that active intrathoracic pressure regulation therapy would be associated with lowered intracranial pressure and increased cerebral perfusion pressure in these patients.

   METHODS: At three institutions, active intrathoracic pressure regulation therapy (CirQlator TM, ZOLL) was utilized for 2 consecutive hours in five mechanically ventilated patients with brain injury. A 30-minute interval was used to collect baseline data and determine persistence of effects after device use. End-tidal carbon dioxide was controlled by respiratory rate changes during device use. The intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure were recorded at 5-minute intervals throughout all three periods of the protocol. Results for each interval are reported as mean and standard deviation.

   RESULTS: Intracranial pressure was decreased in all five patients by an average of 21% during (15 +/- 4 mmHg) compared to before active intrathoracic pressure regulation (19 +/- 4) (p = 0.005). This effect on intracranial pressure (15 +/- 6) was still present in four of the five patients 30 minutes after therapy was discontinued (p = 0.89). As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure was 16% higher during (81 +/- 10) compared to before active intrathoracic pressure regulation (70 +/- 14) (p = 0.04) and this effect remained present 30 minutes after therapy was discontinued. No adverse events were reported.

   CONCLUSIONS: These data support the notion that active intrathoracic pressure regulation, in this limited evaluation, can successfully augment cerebral perfusion by lowering intracranial pressure and increasing mean arterial pressure in patients with mild brain injury. The measured effects were immediate on administration of the therapy and persisted to some degree after the therapy was terminated.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology frequently associated with dural sinus stenosis. There is emerging evidence that venous sinus stenting is an effective treatment. We use phase contrast cine MRI to observe changes in flow dynamics of multiple intracranial fluids and their response to different treatments in a patient with IIH.

   METHODS: We quantified the following parameters at the level of the aqueduct of Sylvius and the cervical C2C3: Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), arterial and venous flow; CSF velocity amplitude; artero-venous delay (AVD); artero-CSF delay and percentage of venous outflow normalized to total arterial inflow (tIJV/tA). Analyses were run before Lumbar Puncture (LP) (A), after LP (B), after medical therapy (C) and after venous stent placements deployed at two separate times (D and E).

   RESULTS: AVD and tIJV/tA improved only after CSF removal and after stent placements. CSF velocity amplitude remained elevated. Arterial flow profile showed a dramatic reduction after LP with improvement in mean venous flow. This report is the first to demonstrate interactive changes in intracranial fluid dynamics that occur before and after different therapeutic interventions in IIH.

   CONCLUSION: The data provide valuable information regarding changes in different fluid compartments suggesting a profound redistribution of pressures along fluid compartments after different treatments. We discuss how increased intracranial venous blood could be "tumoral" in IIH and facilitating its outflow could be therapeutic.

Abstract
  Constipation can cause transient malfunction of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS). Patients with myelomeningocele or cerebral palsy are often diagnosed with hydrocephalus and constipation due to neurogenic bowel. These patients are more prone to VPS dysfunction, often requiring surgical revision. The authors report the case of a 6-year-old girl with a VPS that had been implanted due to hydrocephalus secondary to myelomeningocele. The patient was brought to the emergency department with intermittent headache, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distension and pain. A CT scan revealed ventricular dilatation and radiography of the abdomen showed bowel loop distension. After a Fleet enema and digital maneuvers, her abdominal distension and symptoms improved. A CT scan obtained 24 hours later showed a reduction in ventricular size. The mechanism by which constipation can lead to VPS malfunction can be traced to indirect increases of intraabdominal pressure and direct obstruction of the catheter by distended intestinal loops. Treating constipation can restore the free circulation of the CSF and avoid surgical intervention. Careful neurological monitoring of these patients is essential, because some measures used to treat constipation can increase intracranial pressure. The objective of this report was to highlight constipation as a possible cause of transient VPS malfunction, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgical revisions, to which children with hydrocephalus are frequently submitted.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: The objective of our present study is to evaluate the impact of different PEEP levels on cerebral hemodynamic, gas exchanges and respiratory system mechanics in paediatric patients with post-traumatic brain swelling treated with decompressive craniectomy (DC).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective physiologic study was carried out on 14 paediatric patients presenting with severe traumatic brain swelling treated with DC. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was performed on the middle cerebral artery bilaterally after DC. After assessment at ZEEP, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and gas exchanges were recorded at PEEP 4 and PEEP 8.

   RESULTS: From ZEEP to PEEP 8, the compliance of respiratory system indexed to the weight of the patient significantly increased (P = 0.02) without ICP modifications. No significant variation of the MAP, CPP, Vmed, the total resistance of respiratory system and ohmic resistance of the respiratory system indexed to the weight of the patients was observed. CVP significantly increased between ZEEP and PEEP 8 (P = 0.005), and between PEEP 4 and PEEP 8 (P = 0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: PEEP values up to 8 cmH20 seem to be safe in paediatric patients with a severe post-traumatic brain swelling treated with DC.

Abstract
  CASE REPORT: A 4-year-old boy with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis (KLA) developed progressive headaches and papilloedema and was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri initially treated with acetazolamide. Clinical deterioration prompted placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. After the surgery, the child's condition has markedly improved.

   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: A network of intracranial lymphatics is presently being investigated. Neuroimaging excluded KLA infiltration of the skull and/or meninges, leaving as the most plausible explanation for the child's pseudotumor cerebri the existence of an increase in intracranial venous pressure by venous compression at the thorax. To our knowledge, our case constitutes the first report of pseudotumor cerebri occurring in the context of KLA.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Venous outflow obstruction is recognized as a contributing factor in a subset of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Little is known about venous sinus waveform morphology or how it changes after stenting.

   METHODS: Fifteen patients with IIH underwent waveform recording during catheter venography and manometry. Ten patients (Group A) with venous sinus stenosis and pressure gradient >=7 mm Hg underwent waveform recording during awake venography and during stenting under general anesthesia. Five control IIH patients (Group B) without a gradient underwent awake recording only.

   RESULTS: Group A patients underwent successful stenting with reduction of their gradient from 15.1+/-6.19 mm Hg to 1.2+/-0.60 mm Hg. This resulted in an amplitude reduction from 8.3 mm Hg to 2.8 mm Hg (P=0.02). Qualitative evaluation of the waveform yielded a number of novel findings. In Group A before stenting, the observed waveform progressed from an intracranial pressure (ICP)-dominated to central venous pressure (CVP)-dominated waveform. Stenting abolished the high amplitude waveform and smoothed the transition from the intracranial to central venous measurement points. Group B displayed primarily CVP-influenced waveforms distal and proximal to the transverse-sigmoid junction along with respiratory variability of the waveform, absent in 8/10 Group A patients. General anesthesia appeared to blunt the waveform in 5/10 Group A patients.

   CONCLUSION: The cerebral venous waveform appears to be influenced by both the ICP and CVP waveforms. As measurement moves proximally, the waveform progressively changes to mirror the CVP waveform. Venous sinus stenosis results in a high amplitude waveform which improves with treatment of the stenosis.

Abstract
  We report a case in which an intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) developed after endovascular treatment of a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with venous sinus stenting (VSS). The pathogenesis may involve hemodynamic alterations secondary to increased poststenting venous sinus pressure, which may cause new arterial ingrowth into the fistulous sinus wall without capillary interposition. Despite administration of dual antiplatelet therapy, there may also be subclinical cortical vein thrombosis that contributed to DAVF formation. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, increased inflammation induced by VSS may upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor expression and also promote DAVF pathogenesis. Since VSS has been used to obliterate DAVFs, DAVF formation after VSS may seem counterintuitive. Previous stents have generally been closed cell, stainless steel designs used to maximize radial compression of the fistulous sinus wall. In contrast, our patient's stent was an open cell, self-expandable nitinol design (Protege Everflex). Neurointerventionalists should be aware of this potential, although rare complication of DAVF formation after VSS.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Albumin is used to resuscitate trauma patients but may increase intracranial pressure (ICP). Its effects on renal blood flow and function are unknown. Our aim was to examine the effects of hypertonic albumin on ICP and renal function, and if any effects are due to the hypotonicity of the solution containing albumin or to albumin itself.

   DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Cross-over, randomised controlled experimental study of six adult Merino ewes in the animal facility of a research institute.

   METHOD: Sheep were implanted with flow probes around the pulmonary and renal arteries and an ICP monitoring catheter in a lateral cerebral ventricle. Conscious sheep received normal saline, commercially available hypotonic 4% albumin solution (4% Albumex [278 mOsm/kg]) or a novel isotonic 4% albumin solution (288 mOsm/kg), with at least 48 hours between each intervention.

   RESULTS: Commercial hypotonic albumin solution increased ICP (by 8.5 mmHg [SEM, 2.1 mmHg]; P < 0.01), but neither isotonic albumin solution nor saline significantly changed ICP. The increase in ICP with hypotonic albumin solution was associated with an increase in central venous pressure (CVP) (by 5.4 mmHg [SEM, 0.6 mmHg]; P < 0.001), but no significant changes in cardiac output or stroke volume. None of the infusions changed renal blood flow, plasma creatinine level, creatinine clearance or plasma or urinary electrolyte levels.

   CONCLUSION: Compared with saline or isotonic albumin solution, hypotonic albumin solution increased ICP and CVP, but did not alter arterial pressure, cardiac output renal blood flow or renal function. Our findings support the view that the tonicity of the albumin solution, rather than the albumin itself, is responsible for increasing ICP.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of stroke in neonates, infants, and children.

   RECENT FINDINGS: Arterial ischemic stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are increasingly recognized in childhood as important causes of lifelong morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of arterial ischemic stroke is frequently delayed, as acute neurologic deficits can be challenging to detect in the young child, and stroke is often not considered in the differential diagnosis. Neurologic sequelae following stroke are common, and strategies to minimize stroke size and optimize recovery are being developed. Recurrent arterial ischemic stroke is not uncommon, particularly in children with cerebral arteriopathy. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis causes obstruction of venous outflow leading to venous infarcts. Complications include hemorrhagic conversion of infarcts and increased intracranial pressure. Without treatment, thrombus extension with increased symptoms is common. Robust guidelines of care that exist for adults do not exist for children, particularly for children with arterial ischemic stroke.

   SUMMARY: The approach to stroke in infants and children can be informed by clinical experience in pediatric stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, the extensive literature on pediatric thrombosis, and extrapolation from data from adult patients.

Abstract
  Pressure reactivity indices are used in clinical research as a surrogate marker of the ability of the cerebrovasculature to maintain cerebral autoregulation. The use of pressure reactivity indices in patients with neurological injury represents a potential to move away from population-based physiological targets used in guidelines to individualized physiological targets. The aim of this review is to describe the underlying principles and development of pressure reactivity indices, alongside a critique of how they have been used in clinical research, including their limitations. The primary source literature was identified from a database search of PUBMed and OVID online using the search terms "pressure reactivity index" and "pressure reactivity indices". The evidence base regarding pressure reactivity indices currently remains Level III. Pressure reactivity indices rely on the correlation (-1 to +1) between the arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure, with negative values indicating intact cerebral autoregulation and positive values indicating dysfunctional cerebral autoregulation. Meaningful data is taken from summary measures and trends. The traumatic brain injury population feature most prominently in the literature. There is limited description of the potential confounding factors that may affect pressure reactivity indices, including physiological parameters and therapeutic interventions. Plotting a pressure reactivity index against a cerebral perfusion pressure can indicate an optimal cerebral perfusion pressure to individualise patient care. There is potential to over interpret optimal cerebral perfusion pressure targets when the values of pressure reactivity indices are close to zero. There is an association between pressure reactivity indices and neurological outcomes, however the use of pressure reactivity indices as a prognostication tool is to be challenged. Average values of cerebral perfusion pressure that are not close to averaged values of optimal cerebral perfusion pressure are also associated with poor outcome. Further research is required to ascertain whether targeting an optimal cerebral perfusion pressure may alter outcome.

Abstract
  AIM: Osmotherapy constitutes a first-line intervention for intracranial hypertension management. However, hyperosmolar solutes exert various systematic effects, among which their impact on systemic haemodynamics is poorly clarified. This review aims to appraise the clinical evidence of the effect of mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS) on cardiac performance in neurosurgical and neurocritical care patients.

   METHOD: A database search was conducted to identify randomized clinical trials and observational studies reporting HTS or mannitol use in acute brain injury setting. The primary end-points were alterations of cardiac output (CO) and other haemodynamic variables, while the impact of osmotic agents on intracranial pressure, brain relaxation, plasma osmolality, electrolyte levels and urinary output constituted secondary outcomes.

   RESULTS: Eight studies, enrolling 182 patients in total, were included. HTS exerted a more profound cardiac output augmentation than mannitol, but no distinct difference between groups occurred. Central venous pressure, stroke volume and stroke volume variation were favourably affected by both osmotic agents, whilst the reported changes in blood pressure were inconclusive. HTS infusion yielded a larger intracranial pressure reduction than mannitol but had an equivalent effect on brain relaxation. Mannitol presented a more potent diuretic effect than HTS. Effect on serum osmolality was alike in both osmotic agents, but contrary to HTS-promoted hypernatraemia, mannitol use induced transient hyponatraemia.

   CONCLUSIONS: Mannitol or HTS administration seems to induce an enhancement of cardiac performance; being more prominent after HTS infusion. This effect combined with mannitol-induced enhancement of diuresis and HTS-promoted increase of plasma sodium concentration could partially explain the effects of osmotherapy on cerebral haemodynamics.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Diverse treatment results are observed in patients with poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Significant initial perfusion compromise is thought to predict a worse treatment outcome, but this has scant support in the literature. In this cohort study, the authors correlate the treatment outcomes with a novel poor-outcome imaging predictor representing impaired cerebral perfusion on initial CT angiography (CTA).

   METHODS: The authors reviewed the treatment results of 148 patients with poor-grade aSAH treated at a single tertiary referral center between 2007 and 2016. Patients with the "venous delay" phenomenon on initial CTA were identified. The outcome assessments used the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at the 3rd month after aSAH. Factors that may have had an impact on outcome were retrospectively analyzed.

   RESULTS: Compared with previously identified outcome predictors, the venous delay phenomenon on initial CTA was found to have the strongest correlation with posttreatment outcomes on both univariable (p < 0.0001) and multivariable analysis (OR 4.480, 95% CI 1.565-12.826; p = 0.0052). Older age and a higher Hunt and Hess grade at presentation were other factors that were associated with poor outcome, defined as an mRS score of 3 to 6.

   CONCLUSIONS: The venous delay phenomenon on initial CTA can serve as an imaging predictor for worse functional outcome and may aid in decision making when treating patients with poor-grade aSAH.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Chronic overdrainage affects shunted patients producing a variety of symptoms that may be misdiagnosed. The best known symptoms are so-called shunt-related headaches. There is mounting evidence that changes in cerebrospinal venous system dynamics are a key factor to the pathophysiology of chronic overdrainage syndrome.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 29-year-old woman with a shunt since the postnatal period suffering from chronic but the most severe intermittent headache attacks, despite an open shunt and with unchanged ventricular width during attacks. Intracranial pressure (ICP) recordings were performed during headache attacks and thereafter.

   DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGMENT: Massively increased ICPs, a continuous B wave "storm," and severely compromised intracranial compliance despite an open shunt were found, a scenario that was always self-limiting with the resolution of symptoms after several hours. When mobilized to the upright position, her ICPs dropped to - 17 mm Hg, proving shunt overdrainage.

   OUTCOME AND CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatology can only be explained by sudden venous entrapment following chronic venous distention as a result of chronic overdrainage. Subsequent therapeutic management with an overdrainage preventing shunt and satisfying clinical outcome with complete ceasing of headache attacks adds insight into the pathophysiology of chronic overdrainage syndrome.

Abstract
  Recent interest in intracranial pressure (ICP) in the upright posture has revealed that the mechanisms regulating postural changes in ICP are not fully understood. We have suggested an explanatory model where the postural changes in ICP depend on well-established hydrostatic effects in the venous system and where these effects are interrupted by collapse of the internal jugular veins (IJVs) in more upright positions. The aim of this study was to investigate this relationship by simultaneous invasive measurements of ICP, venous pressure, and IJV collapse in healthy volunteers. ICP (monitored via the lumbar route), central venous pressure (peripherally inserted central catheter line), and IJV cross-sectional area (ultrasound) were measured in 11 healthy volunteers (47 +/- 10 yr, mean +/- SD) in 7 positions, from supine to sitting (0-69degree). Venous pressure and anatomical distances were used to predict ICP in accordance with the explanatory model, and IJV area was used to assess IJV collapse. The hypothesis was tested by comparing measured ICP with predicted ICP. Our model accurately described the general behavior of the observed postural ICP changes (mean difference, -0.03 +/- 2.7 mmHg). No difference was found between predicted and measured ICP for any tilt angle ( P values, 0.65-0.94). The results support the hypothesis that postural ICP changes are governed by hydrostatic effects in the venous system and IJV collapse. This improved understanding of postural ICP regulation may have important implications for the development of better treatments for neurological and neurosurgical conditions affecting ICP.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Currently, the mainstay treatment of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) involves endovascular approaches, especially for high-grade lesions. Transarterial embolization with preservation of venous sinuses has become the preferred approach due to the development of newer liquid embolic agents. For further precision during embolization, the use of temporary balloon occlusion to protect the patency of dural sinuses from the embolic agent's migration has been described.

   METHODS: A 64-year-old man presented with bilateral pulsatile tinnitus and visual decline. A diagnostic cerebral angiogram demonstrated a complex bilateral Borden type II and Cognard type IIB DAVF. Treatment was carried out endovascularly under general anesthesia in a staged fashion. In the first stage, the balloon was inflated during embolization to protect the right transverse sigmoid venous sinus system and torcula. In the second stage, the balloon was again inflated to protect the left transverse sigmoid venous sinus system and torcula during embolization. Complete obliteration of the left DAVF was achieved, and patency of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses was preserved. Patency of the right transverse and sigmoid sinus was also conserved post procedure.

   RESULTS: The patient was treated successfully with transarterial Onyx embolization with transvenous balloon protection of the sinus.

   CONCLUSIONS: This case is the first reported use of the Copernic RC balloon in the United States under the compassionate use guidelines of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The use of this balloon is becoming a useful treatment alternative in selected cases of DAVFs as it improves the safety and efficacy of transarterial embolization as evidenced in this case.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Since the 1950s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt dependency has no longer been a contradiction to normal life, including sexuality and pregnancy in women, because of advances in the understanding of hydrocephalus and shunt technology. Although pregnancy in shunt-dependent women is rare, it causes uncertainty among treating physicians.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 34-year-old pregnant woman with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Throughout her pregnancy she experienced progressive symptoms of CSF underdrainage without any signs of other pregnancy-related complications. After the delivery of a healthy infant, shunt resistance had to be readjusted to prepregnancy levels. A comprehensive review of the literature reports in English, listed in PubMed, is provided.

   CONCLUSIONS: Conservative treatment of pregnancy-related functional underdrainage by consecutive valve pressure adjustment is possible, easy, and safe. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Endovascular venous access is increasingly used for the treatment of many cerebrovascular diseases. The quality of venous roadmapping through arterial injection can be problematic because of contrast media dilution, slow flow velocity, and unilateral opacification of the venous system.

   OBJECTIVE: To describe our experience with the VesselNavigator (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) in performing live 3D roadmapping for intracranial venous procedures.

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Live 3D roadmapping is an image-processing technique that allows dynamic roadmapping of vessels with immediate adaptation to the C-arm movements without the need for contrast injection. For this purpose, 3D MR venography is overlaid on live fluoroscopy images after semiautomatic coregistration. The technique was applied to cases of idiopathic venous stenosis and arteriovenous fistula.

   RESULTS: The process of coregistration was performed by the principal operator in <5 min, just before the treatment. The accuracy was controlled peroperatively and was judged satisfactory. Three illustrative cases demonstrate the use of this software for venous navigation and pressure measurement (case 1), venous stenting (case 2), and transvenous embolization of a carotid-cavernous fistula (case 3).

   CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experience suggests that it is a feasible and safe technique for intracranial venous navigation and procedures. The potential lowering of overall radiation dose and contrast media use needs to be verified with further studies.

Abstract
  We report a severe adverse event occurring in the course of a cohort study (ISRCTN13784335) aimed at measuring the efficacy and safety of venous stenting in the treatment of patients with medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The patient was a 41-year-old woman who was not overweight, who presented with severe headache, grade 1 bilateral papilledema and transient tinnitus, refractory to medical treatment. Right transverse sinus stenting was successfully performed. Following surgery, the patient's state of consciousness decreased acutely with rapid and progressive loss of brainstem reflex. CT scan revealed acute cerebellar and intraventricular hemorrhage with obstructive hydrocephalus. Angioscan revealed normal venous sinus patency and cerebral MRI showed acute mesencephalic ischemia. Mechanical impairment of cerebellar venous drainage by the stent or venous perforation with the large guidewire used in this technique are two logical ways to explain the cerebellar hemorrhage seen in our patient. The risk of such a complication could probably be reduced using alternative tools and technique. However, given the low level of evidence around the safety of transverse sinus stenting in IIH, its formal assessment in clinical trials is required.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is commonly associated with venous sinus stenosis. In recent years, transvenous dural venous sinus stent (DVSS) insertion has emerged as a potential therapy for resistant cases. However, there remains considerable uncertainty over the safety and efficacy of this procedure, in particular the incidence of intraprocedural and delayed complications and in the longevity of sinus patency, pressure gradient obliteration, and therapeutic clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to determine clinical, radiological, and manometric outcomes at 3-4 months after DVSS in this treated IIH cohort. METHODS Clinical, radiographic, and manometric data before and 3-4 months after DVSS were reviewed in this single-center case series. All venographic and manometric procedures were performed under local anesthesia with the patient supine. RESULTS Forty-one patients underwent DVSS venography/manometry within 120 days. Sinus pressure reduction of between 11 and 15 mm Hg was achieved 3-4 months after DVSS compared with pre-stent baseline, regardless of whether the procedure was primary or secondary (after shunt surgery). Radiographic obliteration of anatomical stenosis correlating with reduction in pressure gradients was observed. The complication rate after DVSS was 4.9% and stent survival was 87.8% at 120 days. At least 20% of patients developed restenosis following DVSS and only 63.3% demonstrated an improvement or resolution of papilledema. CONCLUSIONS Reduced venous sinus pressures were observed at 120 days after the procedure. DVSS showed lower complication rates than shunts, but the clinical outcome data were less convincing. To definitively compare the outcomes between DVSS and shunts in IIH, a randomized prospective study is needed.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Venous outflow obstructions are rare anatomic findings that can appear with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure, including headache and vision loss, and can be mistaken for more common diagnoses, such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Although venous outflow obstructions have been reported in rare bone dysplasias and congenital abnormalities, to date they have not been reported in renal osteodystrophy (ROD), a relatively common disorder seen in patients with chronic kidney disease.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this case, the authors describe a patient with marked intracranial hypertension from jugular foramen stenosis secondary to ROD. After diagnosis by CT and magnetic resonance venography, catheter venography confirmed an osseus band around the left jugular bulb, and a 40-mm Hg pressure gradient across the stenotic foramen. The patient subsequently underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting and optic nerve sheath fenestration with symptom improvement. The postoperative course was significant for development of CVST, necessitating treatment.

   CONCLUSIONS: This report reviews the presentation, pathology, and neurosurgical treatment of patients with ROD and venous outflow obstructions, and explores the differential diagnoses of outflow obstructions, IIH, and CVST. To our knowledge, this is the first report of intracranial hypertension from jugular foramen stenosis secondary to renal osteodystrophy. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE The evaluation of the venous neurovasculature, especially the dural venous sinuses, is most often performed using MR or CT venography. For further assessment, diagnostic cerebral angiography may be performed. Three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D-RA) can be applied to the venous system, producing 3D rotational venography (3D-RV) and cross-sectional reconstructions, which function as an adjunct to traditional 2D digital subtraction angiography. METHODS After querying the database of Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas, the authors reviewed the radiological and clinical data of patients who underwent 3D-RV. This modality was performed based on standard techniques for 3D-RA, with the catheter placed in the internal carotid artery and a longer x-ray delay calculated based on time difference between the early arterial phase and the venous phase. RESULTS Of the 12 cases reviewed, 5 patients had neoplasms invading a venous sinus, 4 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension required evaluation of venous sinus stenosis, 2 patients had venous diverticula, and 1 patient had a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst. The x-ray delay ranged from 7 to 10 seconds. The 3D-RV was used both for diagnosis and in treatment planning. CONCLUSIONS Three-dimensional RV and associated cross-sectional reconstructions can be used to assess the cerebral venous vasculature in a manner distinct from established modalities. Three-dimensional RV can be performed with relative ease on widely available biplane equipment, and data can be processed using standard software packages. The authors present the protocol and technique used along with potential applications to venous sinus stenosis, venous diverticula, and tumors invading the venous sinuses.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Venous sinus stenting (VSS) is a safe and effective treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with angiographic venous sinus stenosis. However, predictors of stent-adjacent stenosis (SAS) remain poorly defined.

   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 47 patients with IIH and intracranial venous stenosis who underwent VSS with pre- and post-stent venography. Patient characteristics, treatments and outcomes were reviewed. Changes in pressure gradient after VSS were classified according to pattern of gradient resolution into types I-III.

   RESULTS: Type I gradient resolution, in which mean venous pressure (MVP) in the transverse sinus (TS) decreases towards MVP in the sigmoid sinus (SS), occurred in 18 patients (38.3%). Type II gradient resolution pattern, in which SS MVP increases towards that in the TS, occurred in 7patients (14.9%). Type III pattern, in which MVP equilibrates to a middle value, occurred in 22patients (46.8%). SAS occurred in 0%, 28.6%, and 22.7% of patients in types I, II and III, respectively. Compared with patients with type I gradient resolution, SAS was more common in those with type II (p=0.0181) and type III (p=0.0306) patterns.

   CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of change in the trans-stenosis venous pressure gradient may be predictive of SAS and is a useful tool for classifying the response of the venous obstruction to stenting. A type I pattern appears to represent the ideal response to VSS. Some patients with type II and III changes, particularly if they have other predictors of recurrent stenosis, may benefit from longer initial stent constructs.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND & AIMS: Due to inflammatory and hypermetabolic responses and to extensive exudative trace element (TEs) losses, major burn patients have substantially increased nutritional requirements. To date, information is only available for Cu, Se, and Zn. We aimed at analyzing losses of 12 TEs and Mg through burn wound exudation and corresponding plasma concentrations during the first week after burn injury, and to evaluate the impact of current TE repletion protocols.

   METHODS: Burn wound exudate was collected under negative pressure in 15 adult patients burned 29 +/- 20% of body surface (TBSA) for 8 days after injury. Two samples were collected daily. The TE concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Losses and serum concentrations were compared to intakes.

   RESULTS: For the majority of 12 TEs, the highest losses were observed on day 1, and declined thereafter. Despite Cu supplementation (4.23 mg/day) serum levels remained below reference values. Se supplements (745 mcg/day) normalized and even increased serum levels to upper normal value. Despite large supplements (Zn 67.5 mg/day), serum Zn values remained below reference range. Large exudative losses of B, Br and Mg were found, as well as of Fe and I, with the latter being probably due to contamination.

   CONCLUSION: Current nutritional Cu, Se, Zn repletion protocols in major burn patients which were based on measured exudative losses should be revised to include higher Cu and lower Se doses, as well as planned Mg administration. In burns <20% TBSA and for the other TEs the recommended parenteral nutrition TE doses appear sufficient. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Elevated body mass index (BMI) has been correlated with worse outcomes after treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Venous sinus stenting (VSS) has emerged as a safe and effective treatment for a subset of patients with IIH and evidence of venous sinus stenosis. However, the association between BMI and the efficacy of VSS remains poorly characterized.

   OBJECTIVE: To determine, in a retrospective cohort study, the effect of BMI on preoperative mean intracranial venous pressure (MVP) and post-VSS outcomes.

   METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively collected database of patients with IIH and intracranial venous sinus stenosis who underwent VSS. Patient demographics and treatment factors, including pre- and postprocedural trans-stenosis pressure gradients, were analyzed to identify the relationship between BMI and outcomes after VSS.

   RESULTS: Increasing BMI was significantly correlated with higher maximum MVP (P = .013) and higher trans-stenosis pressure gradient (P = .043) prior to treatment. The degrees of improvement in maximum MVP and pressure gradient after VSS were greatest for obese and morbidly obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2). Maximum poststent MVP, clinical outcomes, and stent-adjacent stenosis requiring retreatment after VSS were not significantly associated with BMI.

   CONCLUSION: We provide direct evidence for a positive correlation between BMI and intracranial venous pressure in patients with IIH. VSS affords a significantly greater amelioration of intracranial venous hypertension and stenosis for IIH patients with higher BMIs. As such, obesity should not be a deterrent for the use of VSS in the management of IIH.

Abstract
  Objective: To detect of the components and concentration of the metals and metalloids in the lavage fluid of whole-lung lavage (WLL) of the cases of pneumoconiosis, and analyze the characteristics, and explore the method to sample and process the samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) . Methods: The samples of urine and serum of three cases of pneumoconiosis were collected before WLL, and the samples of BAL were collected during the WLL from the left and right lungs according to the sequence of four pressured gas flow and five negative pressure drainage. Each of 10ml original samples of WLL was collected firstly, and the left was centrifuged to acquire all the sediment samples and each of 10 ml samples from the centrifuge clear liquids, The components and concentration of the metals and metalloids in the samples were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) . Results: The average volume of BAL from unilat-eral lung for 3 patients was 10 758.3+/-1518 ml, and the average recovery rate was 89.7%. The average dry weight of sediment samples of BAL of three cases of pneumoconiosis was 0.292 gram with the right lung sam-ples slightly higher than the left lung samples. The detectable elements from the samples included Barium (Ba) , Strontium (Sr) , Calcium (Ca) , Magnesium (Mg) , Manganum (Mn) , Ferrum (Fe) , Cuprum (Cu) , Zinc (Zn) , Kalium (K) , Natrium (Na) , Selenium (Se) , Silicon (Si) and Uranium (U) . Each of concentration dis-tributions of these elements were not normal. Except for Cuprum, Selenium and Uranium, the concentrations of the other ten elements in the supernatant samples, mixture samples and sediments samples were statistical-ly different with the nonparametric test of Kruskal-Wallis. The concentrations of Natrium, Kalium and Barium in supernatant samples were higher, while the others in precipitation samples were higher. The concentration of elements in the sample from the right lung was slightly higher than that from the left lung, but there was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05) . There were statistical difference in term of element concentration of precipitates samples before and after pressured gas flow (P<0.05) . The concentration of K Ca Mg Si and Se in se-rum, urine, supernatant and sediment samples had a good correlation. The correlation coefficient of Silicon between serum and precipitation was 0.676 and that between urine and precipitation was 0.524. Conclusion:  The concentra-tions of the metals and metalloid in sediment samples were more stable than that of supernatant and mixture samples. The sampling of one-side lung lavage fluid was representative in the detection of metals and metalloid in the BAL. It was the best time for sampling sediment from the BAL after the first pressured gas flow among the WLL.

Abstract
  Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious complication to left heart disease (LHD), affecting a majority of the patients during the course of the disease. Initially, PH-LHD is caused by passive congestion of the pulmonary vessels due to increased left atrial pressures, a condition that is currently denoted as isolated post-capillary PH (Icp-PH). In the majority of patients the increased atrial pressure is a result of elevated left ventricular filling pressures. Furthermore, chronically elevated filling pressures may yield endothelial damage, resulting in structural and functional alterations in the pre-capillary bed with further elevation in pulmonary pressures as well as elevated vascular resistance, defined as combined precapillary and postcapillary PH (Cpc-PH). With previous definitions of PH-LHD it has been difficult to differentiate between the subgroups, so a new classification was presented in the 2015 PH guidelines. Despite PH-LHD being common and serious, specific therapies are lacking for the pulmonary component. Instead, treatments focus on optimizing the underlying cause of PH-LHD and involve medical as well as surgical therapies. In the present review we presents, based on the new guidelines, current knowledge on pathophysiological and pathobiological mechanisms, epidemiology, investigation and treatment of PH-LHD.

Abstract
  RATIONALE: The superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and transverse sinus are the major dural sinuses that receive a considerable amount of venous drainage. The occlusion of them has been suggested to cause intracranial hypertension, hemorrhage, and lead to potentially fatal consequences.

   PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported a 35-year-old woman with headache presented to our emergency department with a decreased level of consciousness and epileptic seizures. The examination of speech, higher mental function, and cranial nerve were normal. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated both subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage and brain edema at the right temporal lobe accompanied by high density shadow in the right transverse sinus. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed extensive thrombosis of the SSS and bilateral transverse sinus.

   DIAGNOSES: The SSS and transverse sinus thrombosis, accompanied by right temporal lobe hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

   INTERVENTIONS: An emergent mechanical thrombectomy by placed Solitair AB stent in the SSS, respectively, passed left and right sigmoid sinus-transverse sinus route. We removed the most clots, DSA revealed recanalization of the SSS and left transverse sinus was seen with normalization of the venous outflow, the occlusion of right transverse sinus was still present. There were 4 hours after patient back to neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU), patient appeared anisocoria (R/L:4.0/2.5 mm), bilateral light reflexes disappeared, then we took a CT reexamination revealed intraparenchymal hemorrhage increased, brain edema was aggravated at the left temporal lobe, and mild midline shift. Subsequently, we performed decompressive hemicraniectomy and puncture the hematoma supplemented by B ultrasonic. Anticoagulation treatment was initiated 24 hours after surgery, and follow-up DSA showed gradually improved patency in the SSS and bilateral transverse sinus.

   OUTCOMES: Despite occlusion of the SSS and bilateral transverse sinus, patient's symptoms resolved after the operations and he was discharged without complications.

   LESSONS: The favorable clinical outcome after complete occlusion of the SSS and transverse sinus, accompanied by right temporal lobe hemorrhage, SAH has rarely been reported and it might be explained by our timely surgical intervention and development of compensatory cerebral collateral circulation.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), formerly known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a disease of elevated intracranial pressure that is thought to develop due to impaired CSF absorption related to elevated venous sinus pressure in the setting of increased intraabdominal and thoracic pressures. Symptoms can be disabling and, if left untreated, can lead to permanent visual loss. Previous treatments directed toward vision preservation include CSF diversion through shunting and optic nerve sheath fenestration. Recently, attention has been turned toward surgical weight loss strategies as an alternative to shunt treatment. The authors present a report of 3 patients with adolescent-onset IIH that was treated at the authors' institution (Duke University) in whom bariatric surgery was pursued successfully. The patients had previously undergone CSF shunting at ages 12, 15, and 23 years. They were shunt dependent for a collective average of 3.3 years prior to bariatriwc surgery. All patients reported "low-pressure" or postural headaches after bariatric surgery that correlated with dramatic reduction in their weight. Two of the 3 patients had their shunts removed and continued to be shunt free 1.5 years later at last follow-up; the third patient remained shunt dependent with the pressure set at 200 mm H2O. Given the significant complications inherent to multiple shunt revisions, earlier intervention for weight loss, including bariatric surgery, in these patients might have prevented complications and the associated health care burden. The authors recommend a multidisciplinary approach for IIH treatment with early consideration for weight loss interventions in select patients.

Abstract
  We report a case in which an intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) developed after endovascular treatment of a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with venous sinus stenting (VSS). The pathogenesis may involve hemodynamic alterations secondary to increased poststenting venous sinus pressure, which may cause new arterial ingrowth into the fistulous sinus wall without capillary interposition. Despite administration of dual antiplatelet therapy, there may also be subclinical cortical vein thrombosis that contributed to DAVF formation. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, increased inflammation induced by VSS may upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor expression and also promote DAVF pathogenesis. Since VSS has been used to obliterate DAVFs, DAVF formation after VSS may seem counterintuitive. Previous stents have generally been closed cell, stainless steel designs used to maximize radial compression of the fistulous sinus wall. In contrast, our patient's stent was an open cell, self-expandable nitinol design (Protege Everflex). Neurointerventionalists should be aware of this potential, although rare complication of DAVF formation after VSS.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The cribriform plate is a threshold of the intraocular pressure (VOT) and of the intracranial pressure (IKT). The difference between the VOT and IKT is referred to as translaminar gradient (TLG). The goal was to evaluate the Glaucoma progression (visual field, fundus examination, HRT) with / without topical anti-glaucomatous therapy) in relation to the TLG.

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: the significance of TLG has been studied in two groups. I. Group: 57 patients diagnosed and treatment of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (PGOU), 10 patients with Ocular hypertension (OH), 7 patients with Normal-Tension Glaucoma (NTG), and 75 healthy without glaucoma. The examinations of TLG were carried out once and retrospectively. In II. group there were prospectively studied 14 patients with OH and 24 patients with newly detected PGOU without local therapy. The examinations were performed 4 times at intervals of 10 to 11 months. All tests included a basic eye examination, ORA tonometry, HRT examination, gonioscopy, Color Doppler sonography of blood vessels of the eye and orbit. Venous pulsation pressure (VPT) has been recorded by the Ophthalmodynamometer Meditron (D-ODM). In case of spontaneous retinal venous pulsation, VPT was considered as the same pressure as the VOT. The TLG was calculated with formula of Querfurth: ICT = 0.29 + 0.74 (VOT / PI (AO)). [PI(AO) - Pulsatility index of the Ophthalmic artery (AO)].

   RESULTS: I. group: TLG was in the control group without Glaucoma: 12.2 +/- 2.0 torr. The NTG group: 9.0 +/- 1.70 mm Hg. PGOU: 11.1 +/- 1.91 mm Hg. OH: 12.6 +/- 0.85 mm Hg. IKT alone does not show a significant relationship to the presence of glaucoma, ocular hypertension. II. Group: The average TLG in Ocular Hypertension (14 patients) has been 3.8 +/- 1.2 torr. 2 patients (OH) had TLG 10 torr. and 15 torr. After 4 years in one of them (TLG = 15 torr.) there was recorded Glaucoma progression. In the PGOU group before antiglaucoma therapy, TLG was 15.0 +/- 4.8 torr for all patients. After setting up local anti-glaucoma therapy and decreasing VOT, the TLG in 20 patients reduced to 3.6 +/- 1.3 mm Hg.

   CONCLUSION: TLG showed a significant relationship to the Glaucoma progression. The risk of glaucomatous damage increases proportionally with increasing Translaminar gradient. Translaminar gradient can be use to refine the so-called. "Target VOT". TLG has a role in ocular damage (ocular hypertension, glaucoma, vascular occlusion, optic neuropathy), intracranial damage, orbitopathy, selection of appropriate antiglaucomatous therapy.Key words: color Doppler ultrasonography, glaucoma, ocular hypertension, ophthalmodynamometry, translaminar gradient, venous pulsation pressure, venous pulsation.

Abstract
  The microgravity ocular syndrome (MOS) results in significant structural and functional ophthalmic changes during 6-mo spaceflight missions consistent with an increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure compared with the preflight upright position. A ground-based study was performed to assess two of the major hypothesized contributors to MOS, headward fluid shifting and increased ambient CO2, on intracranial and periorbital CSF. In addition, lower body negative pressure (LBNP) was assessed as a countermeasure to headward fluid shifting. Nine healthy male subjects participated in a crossover design study with five head-down tilt (HDT) conditions: -6, -12, and -18degree HDT, -12degree HDT with -20 mmHg LBNP, and -12degree HDT with a 1% CO2 environment, each for 5 h total. A three-dimensional volumetric scan of the cranium and transverse slices of the orbita were collected with MRI, and intracranial CSF volume and optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) were measured after 4.5 h HDT. ONSD increased during -6degree (P < 0.001), -12degree (P < 0.001), and -18degree HDT (P < 0.001) and intracranial CSF increased during -12degree HDT (P = 0.01) compared with supine baseline. Notably, LBNP was able to reduce the increases in ONSD and intracranial CSF during HDT. The addition of 1% CO2 during HDT, however, had no further effect on ONSD, but rather ONSD increased from baseline in a similar magnitude to -12degree HDT with ambient air (P = 0.001). These findings demonstrate the ability of LBNP, a technique that targets fluid distribution in the lower limbs, to directly influence CSF and may be a promising countermeasure to help reduce increases in CSF. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to demonstrate the ability of lower body negative pressure to directly influence cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the optic nerve, indicating potential use as a countermeasure for increased cerebrospinal fluid on Earth or in space.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is known to constitute the major risk factor for development of germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GM-IVH). Head position may affect cerebral hemodynamics and thus may be involved indirectly in development of GM-IVH. Turning the head toward one side may functionally occlude jugular venous drainage on the ipsilateral side while increasing intracranial pressure and cerebral blood volume. Thus, it has been suggested that cerebral venous pressure is reduced and hydrostatic brain drainage improved if the patient is in supine midline position with the bed tilted 30degree. The midline position might be achieved in the supine position and, with the use of physical aids, in the lateral position as well. Midline position should be kept, at least when the incidence of GM-IVH is greatest, that is, during the first two to three days of life.

   OBJECTIVES: Primary objective To assess whether head midline position is more effective than any other head position for preventing or extending germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants born at <= 32 weeks' gestational age. Secondary objectives To perform subgroup analyses regarding gestational age, birth weight, intubated versus not intubated, and with or without GM-IVH at trial entry.

   SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to September 19, 2016), Embase (1980 to September 19,.2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to September 19, 2016). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.

   SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized clinical controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials, and cluster-randomized controlled trials comparing placing very preterm infants in a head midline position versus placing them in a prone or lateral decubitus position, or undertaking a strategy of regular position change, or having no prespecified position. We included trials enrolling infants with existing GM-IVH and planned to assess extension of hemorrhage in a subgroup of infants. We planned to analyze horizontal (flat) versus head elevated positions separately for all body positions.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g., number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, initiation and duration of head midline position, co-intervention with horizontal vs head elevated position, use of physical aids to maintain head position) and assessed risk of bias (e.g., adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow-up). The primary outcomes considered in this review are GM-IVH , severe IVH, and neonatal death.

   MAIN RESULTS: Our search strategy yielded 2696 references. Two review authors independently assessed all references for inclusion. Two randomized controlled trials, for a total of 110 infants, met the inclusion criteria of this review. Both trials compared supine midline head position with the bed at 0degree versus supine head rotated 90degree with the bed at 0degree. We found no trials that compared supine versus prone midline head position, and no trials that compared effects of head tilting. We found no significant differences in rates of GM-IVH (typical risk ratio [RR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 2.35; typical risk difference [RD] 0.03, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.18; two studies, 110 infants; I2 = 0% for RR and I2 = 0% for RD), severe IVH (typical RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.98; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.10; two studies, 110 infants; I2 = 0% for RR and I2 = 0% for RD), and neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.65; typical RD -0.07, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.05; two studies, 110 infants; I2 = 28% for RR and I2 = 44% for RD). Among secondary outcomes, we found no significant differences in terms of cystic periventricular leukomalacia (one study; RR 3.25, 95% CI 0.14 to 76.01; RD 0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.15), retinopathy of prematurity (one study; RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.85 to 6.11; RD 0.25, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.53), and severe retinopathy of prematurity (one study; RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 24.14; RD 0.09, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.26). None of the included trials reported on the other specified outcomes of this review (i.e., cerebellar hemorrhage, brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, impairment in cerebral hemodynamics, long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, and major neurodevelopmental disability). The quality of evidence supporting these findings is limited owing to the imprecision of the estimates. We identified no ongoing studies.

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the imprecision of the estimate, results of this systematic review are consistent with beneficial or detrimental effects of a supine head midline position versus a lateral position and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question.

Abstract
  BACKGOUND AND IMPORTANCE: Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) is a rare fibrosing inflammatory process involving the dura mater. Currently, there is no consensus on the treatments for IHCP, and the usefulness of immunosuppressive agents as a first-line option remains controversial. Cerebral venous sinus occlusion (CVSO) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) secondary to IHCP, which may cause progressive intracranial hypertension and venous obstructive parenchymal lesions, make the diagnosis and treatment of IHCP more complicated.

   METHODS: We present a case of IHCP. We also review previous cases of IHCP with secondary CVSO/CVST and then summarize the clinical characteristics of these patients.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old female patient with IHCP developed secondary CVST. She had a severe headache with a hyperintense lesion on computed tomography, which was considered as subarachnoid hemorrhage. Lumbar tapping with a cerebrospinal fluid test, in addition to gadolinium contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, suggested IHCP. Secondary CVST was identified by digital subtraction angiography and magnetic resonance venography. Fatal intracranial hypertension with severe neurologic deficits occurred, despite mannitol, furosemide, and corticoid therapy. After administration of intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide, she obtained complete remission.

   CONCLUSIONS: We experienced a patient with CVST secondary to IHCP, who was successfully treated with cyclophosphamide pulse therapy. Because IHCP with secondary venous obstruction has various differential diagnoses, venography is necessary to avoid misdiagnosis. The use of immunosuppressive agents may be promising but needs further verification. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  RATIONALE: The superior sagittal sinus (SSS) is the major dural sinuses that receive a considerable amount of venous drainage. Interruption of its posterior third has been suggested to cause intracranial hypertension and lead to potentially fatal consequences.

   PATIENT CONCERNS: We presented a 22-year-old man with a severe headache and scalp bleeding after a head chop wound. Physical examination identified a 20-cm straight laceration in his parietooccipital scalp. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a depressed cranial fracture (DCF) in the left parietooccipital bone, a fracture line across the midline to the right side, and penetrations of bone fragments into the brain parenchyma.

   DIAGNOSES: Traumatic open DCF in left parietooccipital bone.

   INTERVENTIONS: An emergent left parietooccipital craniotomy, followed by cranioplasty to restore the depressed bone flap, was delivered to the patient. Postoperative CT confirmed successful elevation of the DCF and removal of intracerebral bone fragments. However, postoperative CT angiography (CTA) demonstrated an absence of venous flow distal to the fracture, suggesting occlusion of the posterior third of SSS. MRV revealed a persistent absence of venous flow in the posterior third of SSS with dilated cortical venous drainage. Anticoagulation treatment was initiated 3 days after surgery, and follow-up CTA and digital subtraction angiography showed gradually improved patency in the anterior and middle two-thirds of SSS.

   OUTCOMES: Despite occlusion of the posterior third of SSS, patient's symptoms resolved after the operation and he was discharged without complications.

   LESSONS: The favorable clinical outcome after complete occlusion of the posterior third of the SSS has rarely been reported and it might be explained by our timely surgical intervention and development of compensatory cerebral collateral circulation.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterised by an increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of any central nervous system disease or structural abnormality and by normal CSF composition. Management becomes complicated once surgical intervention is required. Venous sinus stenosis has been suggested as a possible aetiology for IIH. Venous sinus stenting has emerged as a possible interventional option. Evidence for venous sinus stenting is based on elimination of the venous pressure gradient and clinical response. There have been no studies demonstrating the immediate effect of venous stenting on ICP.

   METHODS: Patients with a potential or already known diagnosis of IIH were investigated according to departmental protocol. ICP monitoring was performed for 24 h. When high pressures were confirmed, CT venogram and catheter venography were performed to look for venous stenosis to demonstrate a pressure gradient. If positive, venous stenting would be performed and ICP monitoring would continue for a further 24 h after deployment of the venous stent.

   RESULTS: Ten patients underwent venous sinus stenting with concomitant ICP monitoring. Nine out of ten patients displayed an immediate reduction in their ICP that was maintained at 24 h. The average reduction in mean ICP and pulsatility was significant (p = 0.003). Six out of ten patients reported a symptomatic improvement within the first 2 weeks.

   CONCLUSIONS: Venous sinus stenting results in an immediate reduction in ICP. This physiological response to venous stenting has not previously been reported. Venous stenting could offer an alternative treatment option in correctly selected patients with IIH.

Abstract
  Long-term spaceflight induces a near visual acuity change in ~50% of astronauts. In some crew members, postflight cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressures by lumbar puncture are as high as 20.9 mmHg; these members demonstrated optic disc edema. CSF communicates through the cochlear aqueduct to affect perilymphatic pressure and tympanic membrane motion. We hypothesized that 50 mmHg of lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) during 15degree head-down tilt (HDT) would mitigate elevations in internal jugular vein cross-sectional area (IJV CSA) and intracranial pressure (ICP). Fifteen healthy adult volunteers were positioned in sitting (5 min), supine (5 min), 15degree HDT (5 min), and 15degree HDT with LBNP (10 min) postures for data collection. Evoked tympanic membrane displacements (TMD) quantified ICP noninvasively. IJV CSA was measured using standard ultrasound techniques. ICP and IJV CSA increased significantly from the seated upright to the 15degree HDT posture (P < 0.05), and LBNP mitigated these increases. LBNP at 25 mmHg reduced ICP during HDT (TMD of 322.13 +/- 419.17 nl) to 232.38 +/- 445.85 nl, and at 50 mmHg ICP was reduced further to TMD of 199.76 +/- 429.69 nl. In addition, 50 mmHg LBNP significantly reduced IJV CSA (1.50 +/- 0.33 cm2) during 15degree HDT to 0.83 +/- 0.42 cm2 LBNP counteracts the headward fluid shift elevation of ICP and IJV CSA experienced during microgravity as simulated by15degree HDT. These data provide quantitative evidence that LBNP shifts cephalic fluid to the lower body, reducing IJV CSA and ICP. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The current study provides new evidence that 25 or 50 mmHg of lower body negative pressure reduces jugular venous pooling and intracranial pressure during simulated microgravity. Therefore, spaceflight countermeasures that sequester fluid to the lower body may mitigate cephalic venous congestion and vision impairment. Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Venous outflow obstruction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a subset of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), and venous sinus stenting (VSS) has emerged as an effective treatment. However, the effect of anesthesia on venous sinus pressure measurements is unpredictable. A more thorough understanding of the effect of the level of anesthesia on intracranial venous pressures might help to better define patients who might benefit most from stent placement.

   OBJECTIVE: To compare, in a retrospective cohort study, intracranial venous pressures measured under conscious (CS) sedation versus general anesthesia (GA) and to assess the relationship between anesthetic-dependent venous pressures and outcomes after VSS.

   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database to identify patients undergoing angiographic evaluation and VSS for intracranial venous stenosis. Mean venous pressures (MVPs) and trans-stenosis pressure gradients obtained under CS were compared with those measured under GA.

   RESULTS: The maximal MVP was significantly lower under GA (19.8 mm Hg) than CS (21.9 mm Hg; p=0.029). The MVPs in the superior sagittal sinus, torcula, and transverse sinus were lower under GA, but were significantly higher in the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb under GA (p<0.001). The mean trans-stenosis pressure gradient was also significantly lower under GA (8.6 mm Hg) than CS (12.1 mm Hg; p<0.001). Patients with a larger difference between maximum MVP under GA versus CS were more likely to have normalization of the MVP after VSS (p=0.0008).

   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial venous pressures are markedly affected by GA. In order to obtain an accurate measurement of MVPs and trans-stenosis gradients, patients undergoing investigation for IIH should undergo cerebral angiography and venous manometry under CS, which provides more reliable data for outcomes after VSS.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Survival with favorable neurological function after cardiac arrest remains low. The purpose of this review is to identify recent advances that focus on neuroprotection during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

   RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple strategies have been shown to enhance neuroprotection during CPR. Brain perfusion during CPR is increased with therapies such as active compression decompression CPR and intrathoracic pressure regulation that improve cardiac preload and decrease intracranial pressure. Head Up CPR has been shown to decrease intracranial pressure thereby increasing cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow. Sodium nitroprusside enhanced CPR increases cerebral perfusion, facilitates heat exchange, and improves neurologic survival in swine after cardiac arrest. Postconditioning has been administered during CPR in laboratory settings. Poloxamer 188, a membrane stabilizer, and ischemic postconditioning have been shown to improve cardiac and neural function after cardiac arrest in animal models. Postconditioning with inhaled gases protects the myocardium, with more evidence mounting for the potential for neural protection.

   SUMMARY: Multiple promising neuroprotective therapies are being developed in animal models of cardiac arrest, and are in early stages of human trials. These therapies have the potential to be bundled together to improve rates of favorable neurological survival after cardiac arrest.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of any known causative factor. Sinus stenosis is common in these patients. Stenting of stenotic dural sinuses has gained popularity as a treatment option, since these stenoses may contribute to an obstruction of the venous return, and, thereby may contribute to IIH via an increase in venous sinus pressure. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment in IIH with venous sinus stenosis.

   METHODS: Fifty-one patients with IIH underwent stenting. Median age was 40 years. Clinical manifestation was headache in 74.5% of the patients and visual obscurations in 78.5%. Papilledema was present in 50/51 patients (98%), and lumbar puncture documented elevated CSF opening pressure in all but one patient (98%). Sinus stenoses were observed in all patients.

   RESULTS: Endovascular treatment was successfully performed in all patients. There were no major complications encountered (i.e., live threatening or causing a deterioration of a patient's condition equivalent to mRS 3-6). Improvement or resolution of papilledema was observed in 88% of the patients, and 84% reported improvement or resolution of the headache. Follow-up angiographies were performed in 48 patients at a median interval of 49 months and demonstrated in stent-stenosis or a de novo stenosis in 12 patients, eight of them needed re-treatment.

   CONCLUSION: Venous sinus stenting is a safe and effective alternative to other invasive treatments (e.g., optic nerve sheath fenestration, CSF diversion) in patients with IIH. The majority of patients have a persistent clinical benefit.

Abstract
  CSF flux is involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury, all hallmarked by the accumulation of cellular metabolic waste. Its effective disposal via various CSF routes has been demonstrated in animal models. In contrast, the CSF dynamics in humans are still poorly understood. Using novel real-time MRI, forced inspiration has been identified recently as a main driving force of CSF flow in the human brain. Exploiting technical advances toward real-time phase-contrast MRI, the current work analyzed directions, velocities, and volumes of human CSF flow within the brain aqueduct as part of the internal ventricular system and in the spinal canal during respiratory cycles. A consistent upward CSF movement toward the brain in response to forced inspiration was seen in all subjects at the aqueduct, in 11/12 subjects at thoracic level 2, and in 4/12 subjects at thoracic level 5. Concomitant analyses of CSF dynamics and cerebral venous blood flow, that is, in epidural veins at cervical level 3, uniquely demonstrated CSF and venous flow to be closely communicating cerebral fluid systems in which inspiration-induced downward flow of venous blood due to reduced intrathoracic pressure is counterbalanced by an upward movement of CSF. The results extend our understanding of human CSF flux and open important clinical implications, including concepts for drug delivery and new classifications and therapeutic options for various forms of hydrocephalus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Effective disposal of brain cellular waste products via CSF has been demonstrated repeatedly in animal models. However, CSF dynamics in humans are still poorly understood. A novel quantitative real-time MRI technique yielded in vivo CSF flow directions, velocities, and volumes in the human brain and upper spinal canal. CSF moved upward toward the head in response to forced inspiration. Concomitant analysis of brain venous blood flow indicated that CSF and venous flux act as closely communicating systems. The finding of a human CSF-venous network with upward CSF net movement opens new clinical concepts for drug delivery and new classifications and therapeutic options for various forms of hydrocephalus and ideopathic intracranial hypertension.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Venous sinus stenting is an emerging treatment for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and evidence of venous stenosis. Stents placed across the transverse and sigmoid sinuses often cover the vein of Labbe (VOL), a major anastomotic vein draining the cerebral hemisphere. The patency of the VOL after stenting and its clinical implications are poorly understood.

   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing venous sinus stenting. Pre- and post-stent angiography were compared to assess changes in VOL patency, clinical and radiographic outcomes.

   RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 56 patients. The stent covered the VOL in 92.9% of cases. Thirty-two cases with VOL coverage had evaluable angiograms immediately after stent placement. Among these, VOL filled normally in 75.0%, exhibited diminished caliber with normal transit time in 3.1%, filled sluggishly in 18.8%, and was occluded in 3.1%. Follow-up was assessed in patients with at least 3 months' angiographic follow-up (46 patients, mean 7.2 months). Of these, normal filling was seen in 71.7%, diminished caliber in 26.1%, and sluggish filling in 2.2% of cases. Neither stent coverage of the VOL nor its patency immediately after stenting or at follow-up correlated with stent-adjacent stenosis. There were no neurological sequelae from coverage of the VOL or alteration of its drainage pattern.

   CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of venous stenting cases involving the transverse and sigmoid sinuses, the VOL remains widely patent. Complete VOL occlusion rarely occurs after stenting and may not result in clinical sequelae. Stent coverage of the VOL should not deter the therapeutic use of venous sinus stenting.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: More than half of astronauts develop ophthalmic changes during long-duration spaceflight consistent with an abnormal intraocular and intracranial pressure (IOP, ICP) difference. The aim of our study was to assess IOP and ICP during head-down tilt (HDT) and the additive or attenuating effects of 1% CO2 and lower body negative pressure (LBNP).

   METHODS: In Experiment I, IOP and ICP were measured in nine healthy subjects after 3.5 h HDT in five conditions: -6degree, -12degree, and -18degree HDT, -12degree with 1% CO2, and -12degree with -20 mmHg LBNP. In Experiment II, IOP was measured in 16 healthy subjects after 5 min tilt at +12degree, 0degree, -6degree, -12degree, -18degree, and -24degree, with and without -40 mmHg LBNP.

   RESULTS: ICP was only found to increase from supine baseline during -18degree HDT (9.2 +/- 0.9 and 14.4 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively), whereas IOP increased from 15.7 +/- 0.3 mmHg at 0degree to 17.9 +/- 0.4 mmHg during -12degree HDT and from 15.3 +/- 0.4 mmHg at 0degree to 18.7 +/- 0.4 mmHg during -18degree HDT. The addition of -20 mmHg LBNP or 1% CO2 had no further effects on ICP or IOP. However, the use of -40 mmHg LBNP during HDT lowered IOP back to baseline values, except at -24degree HDT.

   DISCUSSION: A small, posterior intraocular-intracranial pressure difference (IOP > ICP) is maintained during HDT, and a sustained or further decreased difference may lead to structural changes in the eye in real and simulated microgravity.Marshall-Goebel K, Mulder E, Bershad E, Laing C, Eklund A, Malm J, Stern C, Rittweger J.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) may cause blindness due to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Venous sinus stenosis has been identified in select patients, leading to stenting as a potential treatment, but its effects on global ICP have not been completely defined. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of venous sinus stenting on ICP in a small group of patients with IIH. METHODS Ten patients for whom medical therapy had failed were prospectively followed. Ophthalmological examinations were assessed, and patients with venous sinus stenosis on MR angiography proceeded to catheter angiography, venography with assessment of pressure gradient, and ICP monitoring. Patients with elevated ICP measurements and an elevated pressure gradient across the stenosis were treated with stent placement. RESULTS All patients had elevated venous pressure (mean 39.5 +/- 14.9 mm Hg), an elevated gradient across the venous sinus stenosis (30.0 +/- 13.2 mm Hg), and elevated ICP (42.2 +/- 15.9 mm Hg). Following stent placement, all patients had resolution of the stenosis and gradient (1 +/- 1 mm Hg). The ICP values showed an immediate decrease (to a mean of 17.0 +/- 8.3 mm Hg), and further decreased overnight (to a mean of 8 +/- 4.2 mm Hg). All patients had subjective and objective improvement, and all but one improved during follow-up (median 23.4 months; range 15.7-31.6 months). Two patients developed stent-adjacent stenosis; retreatment abolished the stenosis and gradient in both cases. Patients presenting with papilledema had resolution on follow-up funduscopic imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT) and improvement on visual field testing. Patients presenting with optic atrophy had optic nerve thinning on follow-up OCT, but improved visual fields. CONCLUSIONS For selected patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis with an elevated pressure gradient and elevated ICP, venous sinus stenting results in resolution of the venous pressure gradient, reduction in ICP, and functional, neurological, and ophthalmological improvement. As patients are at risk for stent-adjacent stenosis, further follow-up is necessary to determine long-term outcomes and gain an understanding of venous sinus stenosis as a primary or secondary pathological process behind elevated ICP.

Abstract
  The potential of blast-induced traumatic brain injury from the mechanism of localized cavitation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is investigated. While the mechanism and criteria for non-impact blast-induced traumatic brain injury is still unknown, this study demonstrates that local cavitation in the CSF layer of the cranial volume could contribute to these injuries. The cranial contents of three post-mortem human subject (PMHS) heads were replaced with both a normal saline solution and a ballistic gel mixture with a simulated CSF layer. Each were instrumented with multiple pressure transducers and placed inside identical shock tubes at two different research facilities. Sensor data indicates that cavitation may have occurred in the PMHS models at pressure levels below those for a 50% risk of blast lung injury. This study points to skull flexion, the result of the shock wave on the front of the skull leading to a negative pressure in the contrecoup, as a possible mechanism that contributes to the onset of cavitation. Based on observation of intracranial pressure transducer data from the PMHS model, cavitation onset is thought to occur from approximately a 140 kPa head-on incident blast.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex pathologies. For patients who do not present with hemorrhage, treatment strategies are often predicated on reducing the risk of hemorrhage and minimizing morbidity. Outcomes vary according to the efficacy of treatment selected. Radiosurgical treatment of certain AVMs can result in incomplete obliteration and may also have only a minimal effect on the presenting nonhemorrhagic symptoms.

   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We present 2 cases of patients with AVMs who were initially treated with radiosurgery. Both patients' primary clinical symptoms were headaches, which persisted after radiosurgical treatment but abated after subsequent microsurgical resection with or without endovascular embolization.

   CONCLUSION: Venous outflow obstruction is likely a sizable contributive factor in occipital AVMs among patients who present with headaches and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Because these high-flow lesions may be suboptimally responsive to stereotactic radiosurgery, microsurgical resection, with or without adjunctive endovascular embolization, should be considered as an initial and definitive treatment strategy. Optimal outcomes may be achieved in patients with a visual deficit that is anatomically correlated to their AVMs. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sinus stenosis occasionally occurs in dural arteriovenous fistulas. Sinus stenosis impedes venous outflow and aggravates intracranial hypertension by reversing cortical venous drainage. This study aimed to analyze the likelihood of sinus stenosis and its impact on cerebral hemodynamics of various types of dural arteriovenous fistulas.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three cases of dural arteriovenous fistula in the transverse-sigmoid sinus were reviewed and divided into 3 groups: Cognard type I, type IIa, and types with cortical venous drainage. Sinus stenosis and the double peak sign (occurrence of 2 peaks in the time-density curve of the ipsilateral drainage of the internal jugular vein) in dural arteriovenous fistula were evaluated. "TTP" was defined as the time at which a selected angiographic point reached maximum concentration. TTP of the vein of Labbe, TTP of the ipsilateral normal transverse sinus, trans-fistula time, and trans-stenotic time were compared across the 3 groups.

   RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of type I, 100% of type IIa, and 84% of types with cortical venous drainage had sinus stenosis. All sinus stenosis cases demonstrated loss of the double peak sign that occurs in dural arteriovenous fistula. Trans-fistula time (2.09 seconds) and trans-stenotic time (0.67 seconds) in types with cortical venous drainage were the most prolonged, followed by those in type IIa and type I. TTP of the vein of Labbe was significantly shorter in types with cortical venous drainage. Six patients with types with cortical venous drainage underwent venoplasty and stent placement, and 4 were downgraded to type IIa.

   CONCLUSIONS: Sinus stenosis indicated dysfunction of venous drainage and is more often encountered in dural arteriovenous fistula with more aggressive types. Venoplasty ameliorates cortical venous drainage in dural arteriovenous fistulas and serves as a bridge treatment to stereotactic radiosurgery in most cases.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE This study identifies quantitative imaging-based measures in patients with Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) that are associated with positive outcomes after suboccipital decompression with duraplasty. METHODS Fifteen patients in whom CM-I was newly diagnosed underwent MRI preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. More than 20 previously described morphological and physiological parameters were derived to assess quantitatively the impact of surgery. Postsurgical clinical outcomes were assessed in 2 ways, based on resolution of the patient's chief complaint and using a modified Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale (CCOS). Statistical analyses were performed to identify measures that were different between the unfavorable- and favorable-outcome cohorts. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the strongest predictors of outcome. RESULTS The strongest physiological parameter predictive of outcome was the preoperative maximal cord displacement in the upper cervical region during the cardiac cycle, which was significantly larger in the favorable-outcome subcohorts for both outcome types (p < 0.05). Several hydrodynamic measures revealed significantly larger preoperative-to-postoperative changes in the favorable-outcome subcohort. Predictor sets for the chief-complaint classification included the cord displacement, percent venous drainage through the jugular veins, and normalized cerebral blood flow with 93.3% accuracy. Maximal cord displacement combined with intracranial volume change predicted outcome based on the modified CCOS classification with similar accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Tested physiological measures were stronger predictors of outcome than the morphological measures in patients with CM-I. Maximal cord displacement and intracranial volume change during the cardiac cycle together with a measure that reflects the cerebral venous drainage pathway emerged as likely predictors of decompression outcome in patients with CM-I.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE The peritoneal cavity is widely used as the destination of choice for cerebrospinal fluid shunts. Various alternative sites have been used, particularly in the presence of certain contraindications. The pleural cavity has been used; however, a paucity of evidence details ventriculopleural (VPL) shunt survival, complication, and revision rates in adults. The aim of this study was to present a single center's experience with VPL shunts, identifying complication, revision, and survival rates. METHODS A single-center, retrospective case series analysis was conducted for VPL shunt insertions and revisions over a period of 5 years. Demographic as well as clinical data were collected. Ventriculopleural shunt survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log rank (Cox-Mantel) test. RESULTS Twenty-two VPL shunts were inserted in 19 patients. Median survival of the VPL shunts was 14 months. Pathological indication for the VPL shunt did not significantly affect survival. A total of 10 complications was observed: 2 infections, 2 cases of overdrainage, 2 obstructions, 1 distal catheter retraction, 2 symptomatic pleural effusions, and 1 asymptomatic pleural effusion. CONCLUSIONS Ventriculopleural shunting is a safe and viable second-line procedure for cases in which ventriculoperitoneal shunts are unsuitable. While VPL shunts have a high revision rate, their complication rate is comparable to that of VP shunts. Ventriculopleural shunt survival can be improved by careful patient selection and the implementation of a combination of valves with antisiphon devices.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a secondary cause of intracranial hypertension (IH). Decreased jugular venous drainage has been seen in patients with idiopathic IH.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A complex case of a 48-year-old female whose idiopathic IH was put into remission after counterclockwise maxillomandibular advancement (CC-MMA), despite persistence of her OSA.

   CONCLUSION: This case highlights the relationship between OSA and IH and points to the significant morbidity that can result from mild OSA and from what are considered borderline intracranial pressures. This indicates the need for a high index of suspicion for actual underlying pathology that can be surgically corrected when patients manifest symptoms of a somatic syndrome. This is the first report in the medical literature of clinical elimination of IH by CC-MMA. The authors propose that this positive outcome was effected via mandibular advancement producing a decrease in jugular venous resistance, allowing improved absorption of cerebrospinal fluid.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Despite the existence of published guidelines for more than a decade, there is still a substantial variation in the management of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus due to its diagnostic and therapeutic complexity.

   DEVELOPMENT: The diagnostic and therapeutic protocol for the management of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus in use at the Department of Neurosurgery of the University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla is presented. The diagnostic process includes neuropsychological testing, phase contrast cine MRI, urodynamic evaluation, continuous intracranial pressure monitoring, cerebrospinal fluid hydrodynamics by means of lumbar infusion testing, and intra-abdominal pressure measurement. A patient is considered a surgical candidate if any of the following criteria is met: mean intracranial pressure >15mmHg, or B-waves present in >10% of overnight recording; pressure-volume index <15ml, or resistance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow (ROUT) >4.5mmHg/ml/min in bolus infusion test; ROUT >12mmHg/ml/min, intracranial pressure >22mmHg, or high amplitude B-waves in the steady-state of the continuous rate infusion test; or a clinical response to high-volume cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal.

   CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a diagnostic and therapeutic protocol for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus management could improve various aspects of patient care. It could reduce variability in clinical practice, optimise the use of health resources, and help in identifying scientific uncertainty areas, in order to direct research efforts in a more appropriate way.

Abstract
  Head protective tools such as helmets and faceshields can induce a localized high pressure region on the skull because of the underwash of the blast waves. Whether this underwash overpressure can affect the brain tissue response is still unknown. Accordingly, a computational approach was taken to confirm the incidence of underwash with regards to blast direction, as well as examine the influence of this effect on the mechanical responses of the brain. The variation of intracranial pressure (ICP) as one of the major injury predictors, as well as the maximum shear stress were mainly addressed in this study. Using a nonlinear finite element (FE) approach, generation and interaction of blast waves with the unprotected, helmeted, and fully protected (helmet and faceshield protected) FE head models were modeled using a multi-material arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method and a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) coupling algorithm. The underwash incidence overpressure was found to greatly change with the blast direction. Moreover, while underwash induced ICP (U-ICP) did not exceed the peak ICP of the unprotected head, it was comparable and even more than the peak ICP imposed on the protected heads by the primary shockwaves (Coup-ICP). It was concluded that while both helmet and faceshield protected the head against blast waves, the underwash overpressure affected the brain tissue response and altered the dynamic load experienced by the brain as it led to increased ICP levels at the countercoup site, imparted elevated skull flexure, and induced high negative pressure regions.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE Cerebral venous pressure gradient (CVPG) from dural venous sinus stenosis is implicated in headache syndromes such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The incidence of CVPG in headache patients has not been reported. METHODS The authors reviewed all cerebral venograms with manometry performed for headache between January 2008 and May 2015. Patient demographics, headache etiology, intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements, and radiographic and manometric results were recorded. CVPG was defined as a difference >= 8 mm Hg by venographic manometry. RESULTS One hundred sixty-four venograms were performed in 155 patients. There were no procedural complications. Ninety-six procedures (58.5%) were for patients with IIH. The overall incidence of CVPG was 25.6% (42 of 164 procedures): 35.4% (34 of 96 procedures) in IIH patients and 11.8% (8 of 68 procedures) in non-IIH patients. Sixty procedures (36.6%) were performed in patients with preexisting shunts. Seventy-seven patients (49.7%) had procedures preceded by an ICP measurement within 4 weeks of venography, and in 66 (85.7%) of these patients, the ICP had been found to be elevated. CVPG was seen in 8.3% (n = 5) of the procedures in the 60 patients with a preexisting shunt and in 0% (n = 0) of the 11 procedures in the 77 patients with normal ICP (p < 0.001 for both). Noninvasive imaging (MR venography, CT venography) was assessed prior to venography in 112 (68.3%) of 164 cases, and dural venous sinus abnormalities were demonstrated in 73 (65.2%) of these cases; there was a trend toward CVPG (p = 0.07). Multivariate analysis demonstrated an increased likelihood of CVPG in patients with IIH (OR 4.97, 95% CI 1.71-14.47) and a decreased likelihood in patients with a preexisting shunt (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.44). CONCLUSIONS CVPG is uncommon in IIH patients, rare in those with preexisting shunts, and absent in those with normal ICP.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Evidence suggests treatments guided by brain oxygen levels improve patient outcomes following severe traumatic brain injury; however, brain oxygen levels are not routinely monitored as an effective non-invasive method has not been established. We undertook a study, in a sheep model of acute brain injury, to assess a new non-invasive brain oximeter. The monitor uses the principles of pulse oximetry to record a pulse and oxygen levels.

   METHODS: We studied 8 sheep. An acute increase in intracranial pressure was induced with an injection of blood into the cranial vault. The temporal changes in the brain oximeter, intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were recorded. Simultaneous conventional skin pulse oximetry was also recorded to assess the possible influence of skin blood flow on the brain oximeter signal.

   RESULTS: At baseline, a pulsatile waveform consistent with the brain circulation was obtained in 7 animals. The baseline brain pulse was quite distinct from the simultaneous conventional skin pulse and similar in shape to a central venous pressure waveform. Injection of blood into the cranial vault triggered an immediate increase in intracranial pressure and fall in cerebral perfusion pressure, by 60-s cerebral perfusion pressure recovered. The brain oximeter oxygen levels demonstrated similar changes with an immediate fall and recovery by 60 s. Periods of high intracranial pressure were also associated with high-frequency oscillations in the brain pulse waveform; there was, however, no change in the conventional skin pulse oximeter pulse waveform.

   CONCLUSION: The brain oximeter detected acute changes in both oxygen levels and the brain pulse waveform following an increase in intracranial pressure levels. The brain oximeter could assist clinicians in the management of acute brain injury. Copyright © 2019 Dixon et al.

Abstract
  Background Regardless of the operative approach, headache, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, and pseudomeningoceles remain disproportionately common problems after surgery for vestibular schwannomas and have a significant negative impact on quality of life and potential to return to full employment. Recent work has raised the possibility that these problems may, in part, be related to acquired obstruction of cranial venous outflow. This article explores this idea further with respect to a group of patients with severe and intractable symptoms. Objective The main objective of this article is to describe our experience diagnosing, investigating, and treating cranial venous outflow obstruction following translabyrinthine resection of vestibular schwannomas. Methods Retrospective review of all patients ( n = 9) at our institution referred for sigmoid sinus stenting following translabyrinthine surgery. Results Headache resolved or improved after sigmoid stenting in all five patients in whom it was the primary symptom. CSF leak was the primary problem in two patients. In one, the leak was unchanged, but headache improved. In the other, the leak resolved, and headache improved. Two patients had symptomatic pseudomeningoceles and both resolved Conclusion Assuming a meticulous approach to wound closure, a CSF leak following surgery for vestibular schwannoma can be viewed as a pathological, but essentially homeostatic, response to raised intracranial pressure caused by acquired obstruction to cranial venous outflow. Postoperative headache (from high or low intracranial pressure) and CSF leaks, therefore, may all respond to measures aimed at eliminating the obstructing lesion.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) shows symptoms by elevating intracranial pressure. Although sinus stenosis has been detected in many patients with IIH, the role of sinus stenosis in IIH remains obscure. Endovascular treatment for IIH due to transverse sinus stenosis has been frequently documented; however, IIH due to multiple sinus stenoses including the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) is rare. Here, we report a case of IIH due to multiple sinus stenoses treated by sinus stenting.

   CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old woman suffered from intractable headache with IIH presented with stenosis of the right transverse and SSS. Stent placement was carried out since intracranial hypertension and trans-stenotic cerebral venous pressure gradient (CVPG) were presented, and her intractable headache disappeared.

   CONCLUSION: IIH can be caused by venous sinus stenoses and stent placement could be an appropriate treatment in patients who demonstrated a CVPG.

Abstract
  Intracranial venous hypertension is a rare presentation of meningiomas in the transverse-sigmoid sinus region. We describe a case of a young patient presenting with intracranial hypertension due to a meningioma causing compression of the dominant sigmoid sinus. We were able to document the cerebral venous pressure gradient across the lesion confirming our hypothesis that compression of the sigmoid sinus from the meningioma was the cause of intracranial hypertension. The patient is a 17-year-old male who presented with intracranial hypertension due to meningioma at the right dominant sigmoid sinus, which was treated by a Simpson grade IV surgical resection followed by stereotactic radiosurgery. Following treatment, his papilledema resolved and he remains symptom-free at 18 months. In conclusion, venous manometry is a useful adjunct to diagnose intracranial hypertension in non-idiopathic causes of intracranial hypertension. A multimodal management approach of intracranial hypertension due to outflow obstruction from the dominant sinus led to an excellent recovery on follow up.

  Neuromuscular blocking agents can be used for purposes such as eliminating ventilator-patient dyssynchrony, facilitating gas exchange by reducing intra-abdominal pressure and improving chest wall compliance, reducing risk of lung barotrauma, decreasing contribution of muscles to oxygen consumption by preventing shivering and limiting elevations in intracranial pressure caused by airway stimulation in patients supported with mechanical ventilation in intensive care units. Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), status asthmaticus, increased intracranial pressure and therapeutic hypothermia following ventricular fibrillation-associated cardiac arrest are some of clinical conditions that can be sustained by neuromuscular blockade. Appropriate indication and clinical practice have gained importance considering side effects such as ICU-acquired weakness, masking seizure activity and longer durations of hospital and ICU stays. We mainly aimed to review the current literature regarding neuromuscular blockade in up-to-date clinical conditions such as improving oxygenation in early ARDS and preventing shivering in the therapeutic hypothermia along with summarising the clinical practice in adult ICU in this report.

Abstract
  Background and Purpose:  Venous sinus stenting (VSS) is a well-acknowledged treatment strategy for patients with a high venous sinus pressure gradient across the site of outflow obstruction. It is not clear whether intracranial venous pressure manometry should be performed awake or under general anesthesia (GA). The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of venous manometry performed under GA or awake setting, and to evaluate stenting candidates to be determined under awake setting or under GA. Methods: The manometry results of 32 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) were recorded under awake setting and general anesthesia before stenting. Mean venous pressures (MVPs) and trans-stenosis pressure gradients were obtained and compared between awake setting and general anesthesia status. Results: MVPs and trans-stenosis pressure gradients of 32 patients under GA and awake pressure setting were recorded. MVPs in the superior sagittal sinus, torcula, and transverse sinus were lower in the GA group, without statistical significant difference (P > 0.05). MVPs were significantly higher in the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb under GA group (p < 0.05). Mean trans-stenosis pressure gradient was significantly lower in the group under GA (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Intracranial venous pressure seems to be affected by different levels of consciousness. Our study reveals that intracranial venous pressure is lower under general anesthesia than in the awake setting, which may have a potential impact on patient selection for venous sinus stenting.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a relatively uncommon cause of stroke more often affecting women and younger individuals. Blockage of the venous outflow rapidly causes edema and space-occupying venous infarctions and it seems intuitive that decompressive craniectomy (DC) can effectively reduce intracranial pressure just like it works for malignant middle cerebral artery infarcts and traumatic brain injury. But because of the relative rarity of this type of stroke, strong evidence from randomized controlled trials that DC is a life-saving procedure is not available unlike in the latter two conditions. There is a possibility that other forms of interventions like endovascular recanalization, thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and anticoagulation, which cannot be used in established middle cerebral artery infarcts and TBI, can reverse the ongoing pathology of increasing edema in CVST. Such interventions, although presently unproven, could theoretically obviate the need for DC when used in early stages. However, in the absence of such evidence, we recommend that DC be considered early as a life-saving measure whenever there are large hemorrhagic infarcts, expanding edema, radiological, and clinical features of impending herniation. This review gives an overview of the etiology and risk factors of CVST in different patient populations and examines the effectiveness of DC and other forms of interventions.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) represent a cluster of typical clinical and imaging findings, with no evident etiological cause noted. In this study, we have proposed a model for IIH and NPH called Monroe-Kellie 3.0 (MK 3.0). IIH and NPH may be entities which represent opposite sides of the same coin with venous system and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as core drivers for both these entities.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: IIH and NPH volume data were collected, voxel-based morphometry analysis was performed without normalization, and the distribution of the individual volumes of gray matter, white matter, and CSF was statistically analyzed. Visual morphometry analyses of segmented data were performed, and the findings in routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were noted to build a model for IIH and NPH.

   RESULTS: In IIH and NPH when the volumes were compared with controls, the distribution was similar. Furthermore, the morphometric changes noted in the MRI and segmented volume data were analyzed and the results were suggestive of changes in elastic property of brain causing a remodeling of brain shape and resulting in minor brain shift in the skull vault, and the resulting passive displacement of CSF which has been termed as MK 3.0.

   CONCLUSION: This model helps to put the clinical and imaging findings and complications of treatment in single perspective.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Rebound high-pressure headaches may complicate treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), but no comprehensive study of such patients has been reported and little is known about its frequency and risk factors. We therefore studied patients undergoing treatment for SIH and performed magnetic resonance venography (MRV) to assess for cerebral venous sinus stenosis, a risk factor for idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

   METHODS: We studied a consecutive group of patients who underwent treatment for SIH. Rebound high-pressure headache was defined as a reverse orthostatic headache responsive to acetazolamide. MRV was obtained in all patients and lateral sinus stenosis was scored according to the system published by Higgins et al., with 0 being normal and 4 signifying bilateral signal gaps.

   RESULTS: The mean age of the 46 men and 67 women was 45.9 years (range 13-71 years) at the time of onset of SIH. Rebound high-pressure headache was diagnosed in 31 patients (27.4%); 14% of patients with an MRV score of 0, 24% with a score of 1, and 46% with a score of 2 or 3 (p = 0.0092). Also, compared to SIH patients who did not develop rebound high-pressure headaches (n = 82), those with rebound high-pressure headaches were younger, more often female, and more often had an extradural CSF collection on spinal imaging.

   CONCLUSIONS: Rebound high-pressure headache occurs in about one-fourth of patients following treatment of SIH and is more common in those with restriction of cerebral venous outflow.

Abstract
  Semipermeable membranes play critical roles in many natural and engineering systems. The osmotic pressure is found experimentally much less effective than the hydraulic pressure to drive water through the membrane, which is commonly attributed to the internal concentration polarization (ICP) in the porous layer of the membrane. In this study, it has been shown that a necessary condition for the osmotic pressure to be effective is water continuity across the entire membrane thickness under negative pressure, i.e., the water inside the membrane remains in a metastable state. However, the metastable state of water cannot be maintained indefinitely, and cavitation will undoubtedly occur in the osmotically driven processes. Collapse of the water metastable state was suggested for the first time to be a more important and fundamental reason for the low water fluxes in the osmotically driven membrane processes.

Abstract
  Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF) refer to an aberrant connection between an artery and a vein within the dura. Although the pathogenesis of dAVF is unclear, a link to cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has been posited though not fully identified. The current case is the first report demonstrating dAVF formation following CVT according to dynamic changes in the intracranial pressure and venous drainage pattern. This observation provides insight into the pathophysiological association between dAVF and CVT. A 60-year-old woman presented with acute onset of a severe headache and first-onset seizure. Initial magnetic resonance imaging showed an extensive thrombosis in the cerebral venous sinuses. However, there was no evidence of any vascular malformation. Eight months later, she reported dizziness, visual obscurations and pulsatile tinnitus. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography showed multiple dAVFs. Endovascular treatments for the dAVF embolization was performed twice, resulting in the obliteration of the dAVF along with the resolution of her optic disc edema, visual obscurations and tinnitus. The degree and pattern of the venous pressure, not hypoxia-induced growth factors, are the key pathogenic mechanisms of dAVF following CVT. Oral anticoagulants and good adherence do not ensure the prevention of dAVF. Thus, careful clinical observation and follow-up examinations are recommended.

Abstract
  Lateral venous sinus stenoses have been associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and venous pulsatile tinnitus. Venous pressure measurement is traditionally performed to assess the indications for stenting in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. However, its reliability has recently been questioned by many authors. The dual-sensor guidewire was first developed for advanced physiological assessment of fractional and coronary flow reserves in coronary artery stenoses. It allows measurement of both venous pressure and blood flow velocities. The authors used this device in 14 consecutively treated patients to explore for symptomatic lateral sinus stenosis. They found that venous blood flow was significantly accelerated inside the stenotic lesion. This acceleration, as well as the pulsatile tinnitus, resolved in all patients following stent placement. According to the authors' results, this guidewire can be helpful for establishing an indication for stenting in patients with pulsatile tinnitus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease of mainly unknown etiology. Latest theories as to the pathogenesis have postulated a final common pathway of cerebral venous hypertension secondary to venous outflow impairment leading to decreased cerebrospinal fluid absorption. We present the case of a 42-year-old female who was treated for several years for headache and for approximately 12 months for IIH until appropriate imaging showed a right-sided cervical dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) at the level of C4. The patient's IIH symptoms resolved following surgical excision of the fistula. We suggest that the cranial venous outflow impairment secondary to the cervical AVF was responsible for intracranial hypertension and that complete investigation of IIH patients should include imaging of the neck vasculature.

Abstract
  When intracranial hypertension and severe lung damage coexist in the same clinical scenario, their management poses a difficult challenge, especially as concerns mechanical ventilation management. The needs of combined lung and brain protection from secondary damage may conflict, as ventilation strategies commonly used in patients with ARDS are potentially associated with an increased risk of intracranial hypertension. In particular, the use of positive end-expiratory pressure, recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and protective lung ventilation can have undesirable effects on cerebral physiology: they may positively or negatively affect intracranial pressure, based on the final repercussions on PaO2 and cerebral perfusion pressure (through changes in cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, venous return, PaO2 and PaCO2), also according to the baseline conditions of cerebral autoregulation. Lung ultrasound (LUS) and brain ultrasound (BUS, as a combination of optic nerve sheath diameter assessment and cerebrovascular Doppler ultrasound) have independently proven their potential in respectively monitoring lung aeration and brain physiology at the bedside. In this narrative review, we describe how the combined use of LUS and BUS on neurocritical patients with demanding mechanical ventilation needs can contribute to ventilation management, with the aim of a tailored "brain-protective ventilation strategy."

Abstract
  For many years, the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) was interpreted as "secondary intracranial hypertension," and IIH was considered to be caused by brain edema due to obstructive sleep apnea. Another theory proposed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption impairment due to excessive medication with vitamin A derivatives. Other reports pointed out the importance of obesity, which may cause an impairment of intracranial venous drainage due to elevated right atrial pressure. Patients with medically refractory IIH have traditionally undergone a CSF diversion. Venous outlet impairment on IIH has recently been reported as a causative or contributory cause, and thus focused venoplasty of the stenotic sinus with a stent has emerged as a new treatment strategy. We report the cases of two patients who presented with headache and papilledema with IIH. They successfully underwent stent placement at the stenosis of the transverse sinus and experienced complete resolution of symptoms.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), which has a prevalence in the general population of 1 to 2 out of 100,000, presents with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) but generally lacks a space occupying lesion.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: Patient 1 is a 32-year-old woman with a history of multiple meningiomas. Upon presentation to our institution, her clinical exam was notable for a right sixth nerve palsy. An integrated diagnosis of PTC was made and shunting for the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion was recommended. Approximately 6 weeks after surgery, the patient exhibited complete symptom resolution and discontinued all medications. Patient 2 is a 40-year-old woman with history of meningioma causing partial obstruction of the right transverse sigmoid sinus. She agreed to undergo surgery for the left ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement, for management of her PTC. Postoperatively, the patient reported that her vision significantly improved. Patient 3 is a 49-year-old woman with history of meningioma who presented with left visual field cut. A right frontal VP shunt was recommended for the treatment of PTC. Postoperatively, the patient reported significant symptom improvement and resolution of visual complaints.

   CONCLUSION: This case series demonstrates that it is important to keep PTC in the differential diagnosis even when mass lesions such as meningiomas are discovered. Although PTC, as the name indicates, is classically diagnosed in patients without intracranial tumors, it is critical that this not be used as an absolute exclusion criterion. Finally, this case series supports the hypothesis that venous obstruction can result in PTC.

Abstract
  In accordance with the trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference theory, decreasing the trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference can relieve glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Increased intracranial pressure can also reduce optic nerve damage in glaucoma patients, and a safe, effective and noninvasive way to achieve this is by increasing the intra-abdominal pressure. The purpose of this study was to observe the changes in orbital subarachnoid space width and intraocular pressure at elevated intra-abdominal pressure. An inflatable abdominal belt was tied to each of 15 healthy volunteers, aged 22-30 years (12 females and 3 males), at the navel level, without applying pressure to the abdomen, before they laid in the magnetic resonance imaging machine. The baseline orbital subarachnoid space width around the optic nerve was measured by magnetic resonance imaging at 1, 3, 9, and 15 mm behind the globe. The abdominal belt was inflated to increase the pressure to 40 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), then the orbital subarachnoid space width was measured every 10 minutes for 2 hours. After removal of the pressure, the measurement was repeated 10 and 20 minutes later. In a separate trial, the intraocular pressure was measured for all the subjects at the same time points, before, during and after elevated intra-abdominal pressure. Results showed that the baseline mean orbital subarachnoid space width was 0.88 +/- 0.1 mm (range: 0.77-1.05 mm), 0.77 +/- 0.11 mm (range: 0.60-0.94 mm), 0.70 +/- 0.08 mm (range: 0.62-0.80 mm), and 0.68 +/- 0.08 mm (range: 0.57-0.77 mm) at 1, 3, 9, and 15 mm behind the globe, respectively. During the elevated intra-abdominal pressure, the orbital subarachnoid space width increased from the baseline and dilation of the optic nerve sheath was significant at 1, 3 and 9 mm behind the globe. After decompression of the abdominal pressure, the orbital subarachnoid space width normalized and returned to the baseline value. There was no significant difference in the intraocular pressure before, during and after the intra-abdominal pressure elevation. These results verified that the increased intra-abdominal pressure widens the orbital subarachnoid space in this acute trial, but does not alter the intraocular pressure, indicating that intraocular pressure is not affected by rapid increased intra-abdominal pressure. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR-ONRC-14004947).

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The pattern of cranial venous drainage in syndromic craniosynostosis is unpredictable and not adequately understood. Collateral channels substitute for stenotic venous sinuses and pose potential risk for surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to analyze the patterns of venous drainage in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and their influence on operative planning and morbidity.

   METHODS: A retrospective study of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis from 2000 to 2013 was performed. Demographic data were collected including phenotype and associated pathologies. Pre- and/or postoperative venous imaging was reviewed for venous sinus stenosis, collateral emissaries, and persistent fetal sinuses. Categorization of anomalous venous drainage was performed, and the relationship with surgical morbidity was assessed.

   RESULTS: Forty-one patients were identified. Anomalies were present in 31 patients (76%) consisting of dural sinus stenosis in 28 (68%), dilated emissaries in 26 (63%), and fetal sinuses in 7 (17%). Pfeiffer syndrome was most commonly associated with anomalous drainage (100%). Venous anomalies were associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), shunted hydrocephalus, Chiari malformations, and sleep apnea. In 5 cases, the surgical plan was adjusted based on anomalous anatomy. No mortalities occurred. Intraoperative complication rate was 7.3%, all with anomalous drainage. Median estimated blood loss was 1,100 cc for patients with anomalies versus 400 cc without anomalies (P = 0.181).

   CONCLUSION: Cranial venous anomalies are commonly detected in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and may affect surgical morbidity and outcome with a higher estimated blood loss, alteration of procedure, and postoperative morbidity. Detailed preoperative imaging of the venous drainage is therefore recommended in cases of syndromic synostosis.

Abstract
  Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis often require a large amount of cranial expansion to avoid intracranial hypertension, but the surgical procedure remains controversial. A patient of severe syndromic craniosynostosis with multiple bony defects and anomalous venous drainage at the occipital region was treated by multidirectional cranial distraction osteogenesis (MCDO) at the age of 8 months. Distraction started 5 days after surgery and ceased on postoperative day 16. The distraction devices were removed 27 days after completing distraction. After device removal, the increase of intracranial volume was 155 ml and the cephalic index was improved from 115.5 to 100.5. The resultant cranial shape was well maintained with minimal relapse at postoperative 9 months. In cases of syndromic craniosynostosis with multiple bony defects and/or anomalous venous drainage at the occipital region, expansion of the anterior cranium by MCDO is a viable alternative to conventional methods.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a rare condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory, or radiological evidence of intracranial pathology. Early management could prevent irreversible outcomes.

   CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old single Arabian female of Arab origin presented with a 2-day complaint of horizontal diplopia and transient visual obscurations. She denied any history of headache or decreased vision. The patient was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome a year prior to presentation. Examination revealed bilateral moderate papilledema and limited left eye abduction. However, visual acuity and fields were normal. Increased intracranial pressure was confirmed by lumbar puncture opening pressure (550 mm H<Sub>2</Sub>O). The cerebrospinal fluid composition and imaging of brain and cerebral venous system were normal. The diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was confirmed and the patient was treated with acetazolamide 500 mg twice per day. The symptoms totally resolved within 3 days and the papilledema disappeared after 2 months.

   CONCLUSION: Awareness of such uncommon presentation of idiopathic intracranial hypertension emphasizes the critical importance of detailed ophthalmic examination and shows the good prognosis of early management.

Abstract
  Background The extent to which intracranial venous sinus obstruction contributes to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is debated. The extent to which extracranial venous obstruction contributes to IIH is virtually unexplored. This article describes an interventional approach to extracranial venous outflow in a group of patients with severe intractable symptoms. Objective To describe our technique and experience of styloidectomy combined with jugular stenting in the treatment of skull base narrowing of the jugular veins. Methods Retrospective review of all styloidectomies undertaken at our institution (n = 34), as an adjunct or alternative to jugular venous stenting, with a view to improving cranial venous outflow. Results Eleven styloidectomies were for delayed complications of jugular stenting. Of seven with stent dysfunction, three were improved and four unchanged. Of seven with accessory nerve compression (three had both), four resolved and three improved. In 23 instances, styloidectomy preceded or obviated jugular stenting. Two had a virtual resolution of symptoms, 13 were improved, and 8 were unchanged. Conclusion Styloidectomy can replace, salvage, or complement jugular venous stenting in IIH and disturbances of cranial venous outflow.

Abstract
  Severe visual loss may occur in patients with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Transverse sinus stenosis is 1 cause of PTC syndrome. Although the role of transverse sinus stenosis in the pathogenesis of the disease remains controversial, recent case series of transverse sinus stenting have reported very high rates of symptom response and resolution of papilledema with improvement or at least stabilization of the visual fields and visual acuity (Ahmed et al., 2011). 1 We report a previously unpublished complication of diffuse, nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage following angioplasty and stenting in a patient with refractory PTC.

Abstract
  Steady-state tilt has no effect on cerebrovascular reactivity to increases in the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2). However, the anterior and posterior cerebral circulations may respond differently to a variety of stimuli that alter central blood volume, including lower body negative pressure (LBNP). Little is known about the superimposed effects of head-up tilt (HUT; decreased central blood volume and intracranial pressure) and head-down tilt (HDT; increased central blood volume and intracranial pressure), and LBNP on cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses. We hypothesized that (a) cerebral blood velocity (CBV; an index of CBF) responses during LBNP would not change with HUT and HDT, and (b) CBV in the anterior cerebral circulation would decrease to a greater extent compared to posterior CBV during LBNP when controlling PETCO2 In 13 male participants, we measured CBV in the anterior (middle cerebral artery, MCAv) and posterior (posterior cerebral artery, PCAv) cerebral circulations using transcranial Doppler ultrasound during LBNP stress (-50 mmHg) in three body positions (45degreeHUT, supine, 45degreeHDT). PETCO2 was measured continuously and maintained at constant levels during LBNP through coached breathing. Our main findings were that (a) steady-state tilt had no effect on CBV responses during LBNP in both the MCA (P = 0.077) and PCA (P = 0.583), and (b) despite controlling for PETCO2, both the MCAv and PCAv decreased by the same magnitude during LBNP in HUT (P = 0.348), supine (P = 0.694), and HDT (P = 0.407). Here, we demonstrate that there are no differences in anterior and posterior circulations in response to LBNP in different body positions. Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Abstract
  Understanding the altered physiology following cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion in the setting of adult hydrocephalus is important for optimizing patient care and avoiding complications. There is mounting evidence that the cerebral venous system plays a major role in intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics especially when one takes into account the effects of postural changes, atmospheric pressure, and gravity on the craniospinal axis as a whole. An evolved mechanism acting at the cortical bridging veins, known as the "Starling resistor," prevents overdrainage of cranial venous blood with upright positioning. This protective mechanism can become nonfunctional after CSF diversion, which can result in posture-related cerebral venous overdrainage through the cranial venous outflow tracts, leading to pathological states. This review article summarizes the relevant anatomical and physiological bases of the relationship between the craniospinal venous and CSF compartments and surveys complications that may be explained by the cerebral venous overdrainage phenomenon. It is hoped that this article adds a new dimension to our therapeutic methods, stimulates further research into this field, and ultimately improves our care of these patients.

Abstract
  It is proposed that negative central nervous system (CNS) pressure is one of the filling mechanisms of the fluid spaces of the CNS. Negative CNS pressure is caused by the combination of gravitational force and body movement. The venous system imposes pressure fluctuations on the CNS due to changes in posture and body cavity pressure. It is proposed here that filling of veins, arteries and cerebrospinal (CSF) spaces are all assisted by negative CNS pressure. Hyperemia in the CNS in response to pressure changes with movement was described in the first part of this hypothesis. By this means parenchyma water levels may increase (Williams, 2008). In the developmental forms of hydrocephalus expansion of CSF spaces is a more prominent feature than parenchyma water changes. This feature is explained by this second part of the hypothesis where the negative pulsatility of pressure that can accompany positive pressure pulsatility, which occurs with body movement, is described as the pathological force that leads to cavity filling. When CNS compliance is lost there is overrepresentation of low and well as high pressure pulsations in response to body movements. Pressure that leads to the development of hydrocephalus can be described as being abnormally labile. Negative CNS pressure causes cavity filling in an analogous way to pleural cavity filling, with water passing from parenchyma tissue. Positive pressure within the pressure profile may cause expansion of regions of the CNS skeletal system that are able to grow such as the cranial vault so that large head size is a frequent accompaniment to hydrocephalus that is caused by this mechanism. Hydrocephalic disorders that are characterised by negative pressure filling mechanism often have a skeletal anatomical abnormality that causes reduced CNS compliance and adversely affect neural development. This is often in the form of obstruction to CSF flow around the base of the brain that then leads to vault expansion by means of high pressure pulsation and ventricle enlargement by means of low pressure pulsation. In health pressure pulsatility does not lead to enduring changes in water distribution within the CNS compartments but it assists physiological water balance. Copyright © 2016 The Author.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE Ventricular dilation secondary to tumor obstruction of the posterior fossa CSF outflow in childhood is an intraaxial process. However, third ventriculostomy or complete tumor removal often fails to reduce the pressure in some children, and in others there is a delayed reduction in intracranial pressure; this is termed the adaptation period. The cause of this adaptation period has not been studied. Venous sinus compression is highly correlated with other forms of childhood hydrocephalus, and this study seeks to follow the changes that occur in sinus cross-sectional area after surgery. METHODS Twelve children with posterior fossa tumors underwent MRI examination that included standard T2-weighted and 3D contrast-enhanced images obtained preoperatively, in the immediate postoperative period, and after several months. The volumes of the lateral and third ventricles and the minimum cross-sectional area of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses were measured. Patients were categorized by 1) shunt status (those who required a shunt vs those who did not) and 2) by age (those younger than 3 years vs those older than 3 years at diagnosis). RESULTS There was a significant reduction in ventricular volume in both the immediate and secondary follow-up periods for all patients. There was preoperative venous sinus compression in all groups, which did not change significantly in the immediate postoperative period but did improve in the secondary follow-up period. The younger children had larger ventricles and smaller sinuses before surgery compared with the older children. CONCLUSIONS In children with obstructed hydrocephalus caused by tumor, there is secondary compression of venous outflow, indicating both an intra- and extraaxial process. The expansion of the sinuses following decompression of the posterior fossa is delayed and may correlate with the adaptation period. Younger children have greater sinus compression than older ones.

Abstract
  Mechanical ventilation in the brain-injured pediatric patient requires many considerations, including the type and severity of lung and brain injury and how progression of such injury will develop. This review focuses on neurological breathing patterns at presentation, the effect of brain injury on the lung, developmental aspects of blood gas tensions on cerebral blood flow, and strategies used during mechanical ventilation in infants and children receiving neurological intensive care. Taking these basic principles, our clinical approach is informed by balancing the blood gas tension targets that follow from the ventilation support we choose and the intracranial consequences of these choices on vascular and hydrodynamic physiology. As such, we are left with two key decisions: a low tidal volume strategy for the lung versus the consequence of hypercapnia on the brain; and the use of positive end expiratory pressure to optimize oxygenation versus the consequence of impaired cerebral venous return from the brain and resultant intracranial hypertension.

Abstract
  An intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) defined as a pathological increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is commonly found on ICU admission or during the ICU stay. Several studies confirmed that an IAH is an independent predictor for mortality of critically ill patients. The abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) which is defined as a sustained IAP>20 mmHg (with or without an abdominal perfusion pressure [APP]<60mmHg) that is associated with new organ dysfunction or failure has a mortality of up to 60%. In general, an IAH may be induced by several intra-abdominal as well as extra-abdominal conditions. Reduced abdominal wall compliance, intra-abdominal pathologies (either of the peritoneal space or parenchymateous organs) may lead to an IAH. Most commonly, intra-abdominal infections and/or sepsis and severe trauma or burns are predisposing for an IAH. An early sign may be a decrease in urinary output. The effects of an increased IAP on cardiovascular function are well recognized and include negative effects on preload, afterload and contractility. However, all other compartments of the body may be affected by an IAH. Thus, by an increase of the respective compartment pressure, e.g. intracranial pressure, a poly-compartment syndrome may result. Adequate prevention, a forward-looking strategy, and objective techniques for measurement of IAP are required to avoid or early detect an IAH or ACS. Finally, an immediate and consequent interdisciplinary management using conservative, interventional and operative options are necessary to solve an IAH or ACS.

Abstract
  Regardless of the underlying pathology, elevated intracranial pressure is the endpoint of any impairment in either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption (including arachnoid villi) or intracranial venous drainage. In all age groups, the predominant final common pathway for CSF drainage is the dural venous sinus system. Intracranial venous hypertension (ICVH) is an important vascular cause of intracranial hypertension (and its subsequent sequelae), which has often been ignored due to excessive attention to the arterial system and, specifically, arteriovenous shunts. Various anatomical and pathological entities have been described to cause ICVH. For the second time, we present a unique case of severe focal stenosis in the distal sigmoid sinus associated with concurrent hypoplasia of the contralateral transverse sinus causing a significant pressure gradient and intracranial hypertension, which was treated with endovascular stent placement and angioplasty.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Trauma is the fifth principal cause of death in Singapore, with traumatic brain injury (TBI) being the leading specific subordinate cause.

   METHODS: This study was an eight-year retrospective review of the demographic profiles of patients with severe TBI who were admitted to the neurointensive care unit (NICU) of the National Neuroscience Institute at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, between 2004 and 2011.

   RESULTS: A total of 780 TBI patients were admitted during the study period; 365 (46.8%) patients sustained severe TBI (i.e. Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8), with the majority (75.3%) being male. The ages of patients with severe TBI ranged from 14-93 years, with a bimodal preponderance in young adults (i.e. 21-40 years) and elderly persons (i.e. > 60 years). Motor vehicle accidents (48.8%) and falls (42.5%) were the main mechanisms of injury. Invasive line monitoring was frequently employed; invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring and central venous pressure monitoring were used in 81.6% and 60.0% of the patients, respectively, while intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement was required in 47.4% of the patients. The use of tiered therapy to control ICP (e.g. sedation, osmotherapy, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, moderate hyperventilation and barbiturate-induced coma) converged with international practices.

   CONCLUSION: The high-risk groups for severe TBI were young adults and elderly persons involved in motor vehicle accidents and falls, respectively. In the NICU, the care of patients with severe TBI requires heavy utilisation of resources. The healthcare burden of these patients extends beyond the acute critical care phase.

Abstract
  Loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs commonly in daily neurosurgical practice. Understanding the altered physiology following CSF loss is important for optimization of patient care and avoidance of complications. There is overwhelming evidence now that the cerebral venous system plays a major role in intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics especially when one takes into account the effects of postural changes, atmospheric pressure, and gravity on the craniospinal axis as a whole. The CSF and cerebral venous compartments are tightly coupled in two important ways. CSF is resorbed into the venous system, and there is also an evolved mechanism that prevents overdrainage of venous blood with upright positioning known as the Starling resistor. With loss of CSF pressure, this protective mechanism could become nonfunctional which may result in posture-related venous overdrainage through the cranial venous outflow tracts leading to pathologic states. This review article summarizes the relevant anatomic and physiologic basis of the relationship between the craniospinal venous and CSF compartments in the setting of CSF diversion. It is hoped that this article improves our understanding of ICP dynamics after CSF loss, adds a new dimension to our therapeutic methods, stimulates further research into this field, and ultimately improves our care of these patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lumbar epidural blood patch (EBP) is a commonly used procedure to treat postdural puncture headache. We present a case of vision loss immediately following an EBP.

   CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old woman with idiopathic intracranial hypertension received an EBP for postdural puncture headache at an outside facility without fluoroscopic guidance and in the seated position. The patient experienced syncope during the procedure as 25 mL of autologous blood was rapidly injected. The patient regained consciousness and described bilateral vision loss. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was negative for hemorrhage. Dilated fundus examination revealed significant, bilateral retinal and vitreous hemorrhage consistent with Terson syndrome.

   CONCLUSIONS: This patient developed Terson syndrome as an immediate EBP complication. Iatrogenic Terson syndrome has been previously described with epidural space saline and anesthetic injections, but not EBP. Of 11 reported cases, 10 were female, and 9 had complete vision recovery. Previous studies have demonstrated that epidural space injection increases subarachnoid pressure in a volume- and rate-dependent fashion. An abrupt increase in subarachnoid space pressure likely led to retinal hemorrhage by compromising retinal venous drainage. This is the first known case of Terson syndrome caused by EBP. Injectate volume should be minimized, and a slow rate of injection pursued. The anesthesiologist, pain interventionist, and ophthalmologist should be aware of this rare but disabling complication and consider taking extra precautions when consenting patients for EBP with vision compromise or comorbidities concerning for elevated intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  Meningiomas that partially or completely occlude the superior sagittal sinus may create a pseudotumor-like syndrome in certain patients. These patients may have impaired CSF absorption as a result of higher proximal venous pressure. Higher pressures after resection may encumber adequate wound healing and worsen symptoms. Here, the authors present a small series of patients with meningiomas involving the posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus, with documented high intracranial pressure prior to surgery. This paper aims to address the proposed etiology of high intracranial pressure in these patients and its associated complications, including CSF leak, wound dehiscence, pressure-related headaches, and visual complaints. In this paper, the authors propose a management plan to avoid wound complications and pseudotumor-related complications. When considering surgical intervention for patients with compromise of the posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus, careful attention must be paid to addressing potentially elevated intracranial pressure perioperatively.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), which typically progresses from either acute or subacute onset, presents with symptoms related to intracranial hypertension (e.g., headache and papilledema) and brain parenchymal lesions (e.g., aphasia and hemiplegia). Anticoagulation therapy is generally accepted as a treatment for CVT and often leads to good clinical outcomes. However, we experienced a case of CVT with an uncommon clinical course. The patient was a 63-year-old man who presented with headache, papilledema, visual loss, and diplopia; his condition gradually deteriorated, and he was diagnosed with CVT via cerebral angiography. The sinus thrombus was extensive and resistant to anticoagulation therapy, and lumbar puncture revealed a progressive increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. We performed a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt procedure, which yielded marked improvement in the symptoms. The main mechanism of neurological dysfunction in CVT is venous outflow obstruction caused by venous thrombus, which results in brain edema, and/or venous infarction, which induces focal neurological signs. Another mechanism is impaired CSF absorption in the thrombosed sinuses, resulting in intracranial hypertension. We speculated that the latter mechanism strongly influenced our case, thus explaining the uncommon clinical course and effectiveness of the LP shunt procedure. Although LP shunting is not a common treatment for CVT, this case report could indicate the usefulness of this procedure for CVT with chronic progression and resistance to anticoagulation therapy.

Abstract
  We evaluated postural effects on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure [CPP: mean arterial pressure (MAP) - ICP] in neurosurgical patients undergoing 24-h ICP monitoring as part of their diagnostic workup. We identified nine patients (5 women, age 44 +/- 20 yr; means +/- SD), who were "as normal as possible," i.e., without indication for neurosurgical intervention (e.g., focal lesions, global edema, abnormalities in ICP-profile, or cerebrospinal fluid dynamics). ICP (tip-transducer probe; Raumedic) in the brain parenchyma (n = 7) or in the lateral ventricles (n = 2) and cardiovascular variables (Nexfin) were determined from 20degree head-down tilt to standing up. Compared with the supine position, ICP increased during 10degree and 20degree of head-down tilt (from 9.4 +/- 3.8 to 14.3 +/- 4.7 and 19 +/- 4.7 mmHg; P < 0.001). Conversely, 10degree and 20degree head-up tilt reduced ICP to 4.8 +/- 3.6 and 1.3 +/- 3.6 mmHg and ICP reached -2.4 +/- 4.2 mmHg in the standing position (P < 0.05). Concordant changes in MAP maintained CPP at 77 +/- 7 mmHg regardless of body position (P = 0.95). During head-down tilt, the increase in ICP corresponded to a hydrostatic pressure gradient with reference just below the heart, likely reflecting the venous hydrostatic indifference point. When upright, the decrease in ICP was attenuated, corresponding to formation of a separate hydrostatic gradient with reference to the base of the skull, likely reflecting the site of venous collapse. ICP therefore seems to be governed by pressure in the draining veins and collapse of neck veins may protect the brain from being exposed to a large negative pressure when upright. Despite positional changes in ICP, MAP keeps CPP tightly regulated. Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

Abstract
  Hydrocephalus is a common disorder of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) physiology resulting in abnormal expansion of the cerebral ventricles. Infants commonly present with progressive macrocephaly whereas children older than 2 years generally present with signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. The classic understanding of hydrocephalus as the result of obstruction to bulk flow of CSF is evolving to models that incorporate dysfunctional cerebral pulsations, brain compliance, and newly characterised water-transport mechanisms. Hydrocephalus has many causes. Congenital hydrocephalus, most commonly involving aqueduct stenosis, has been linked to genes that regulate brain growth and development. Hydrocephalus can also be acquired, mostly from pathological processes that affect ventricular outflow, subarachnoid space function, or cerebral venous compliance. Treatment options include shunt and endoscopic approaches, which should be individualised to the child. The long-term outcome for children that have received treatment for hydrocephalus varies. Advances in brain imaging, technology, and understanding of the pathophysiology should ultimately lead to improved treatment of the disorder. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the characteristics of sigmoid plate dehiscence (SPD) causing pulsatile tinnitus (PT) on CT arteriography and venography (CTA + V).

   METHODS: Thirty PT patients treated successfully with SPD reconstruction were enrolled. Sixty asymptomatic patients were matched. The location, extent, number of SPD cases and concomitant signs, including venous outflow dominance, transverse sinus stenosis, high jugular bulb, temporal bone pneumatization, height of pituitary gland and pituitary fossa, abnormal mastoid emissary vein, were detected and compared using CTA + V.

   RESULTS: More than one SPD was found on the symptomatic side in 13/30 PT patients (43.3 %). The upper segment of the sigmoid plate was involved in 29/44 SPDs in the vertical direction (65.9 %); the lateral wall was involved in 38/44 SPDs in the horizontal direction (86.4 %). Singular SPD was detected in 3/60 asymptomatic patients (1.67 +/- 0.35 mm(2)), less so in PT patients (7.97 +/- 5.17 mm(2)). Compared with the control group, ipsilateral venous outflow dominance, high jugular bulb and bilateral transverse sinus stenosis were more common in the PT group, together with deeper pituitary fossa and flatter pituitary glands.

   CONCLUSION: SPD causing PT has characteristic CT findings. It may be generated by vascular or intracranial pressure abnormalities and act as a common key to triggering PT's perception.

   KEY POINTS: Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) caused by sigmoid plate dehiscence (SPD) may be cured. SPD causing PT has some characteristic findings on CT. SPD may be a common key to triggering PT's perception. Thin-slice high resolution CT venography is recommended for SPD assessment. The relationship between intracranial pressure and SPD causing PT should be studied.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Reversible cerebral constriction syndrome and cerebral venous thrombosis are two rare conditions. Reversible cerebral constriction syndrome affects the cerebral arteries and the pathology is still largely unknown. To date, no physiological link with cerebral venous thrombosis has been reported.

   CASE RESULTS: We report here the case of a 24-year-old woman who presented a reversible cerebral constriction syndrome in the setting of a cerebral venous thrombosis. Cerebral venous thrombosis had developed in her left lateral venous sinus, within the stent placed one year before, in order to treat an idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

   DISCUSSION: The co-occurrence of cerebral venous thrombosis and reversible cerebral constriction syndrome in the same patient raises the issue of a potential link between them. We discuss the potential common trigger factors in this case: recent hormonal therapy; intracranial hypotension iatrogenically induced by lumbar puncture.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The effect of dural venous sinus stenting has been investigated for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) but the effect of stenting on the long-term patency of the cortical draining veins, especially the vein of Labbe (VOL), remains unknown.

   METHODS: We reviewed our database of 38 patients with IIH with 41 stented dural venous sinuses between October 2006 and December 2014. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data were reviewed. Follow-up catheter angiographic data were included when available.

   RESULTS: Stent placement spanned the ostium of the VOL in 35 patients (92.1%), with no immediate effect on the drainage of the VOL. Follow-up angiography (mean 35.1 months, range 1.7-80.7 months) was available in 24 patients, 21 of whom had stents spanning the VOL ostium. The VOL remained patent without occlusion or drainage alteration in all 21 patients. There were no immediate or long-term intracranial complications.

   CONCLUSIONS: Dural venous sinus stenting for patients with IIH does not affect the immediate or long-term patency of the VOL and is not associated with intracranial complications.

Abstract
  The intracranial venous sinus is an important component of vascular disease. Many diseases involve the venous sinus and are accompanied by venous sinus stenosis (VSS), which leads to increased venous pressure and high intracranial pressure. Recent research has focused on stenting as a treatment for VSS related to these diseases. However, a systematic understanding of venous sinus stenting (VS-Stenting) is lacking. Herein, the literature on idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), venous pulsatile tinnitus, sinus thrombosis, high draining venous pressure in dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and tumor-caused VSS was reviewed and analyzed to summarize experiences with VS-Stenting as a treatment. The literature review showed that satisfactory therapeutic effects can be achieved through stent angioplasty. Thus, the present study suggests that selective stent release in the venous sinus can effectively treat these diseases and provide new possibilities for treating intracranial vascular disease.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The objective of this investigation was to evaluate changes in intrathoracic pressure (Ppl), airway pressure (Paw) and vital organ perfusion pressures during standard and intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR)-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

   METHODS: Multiple CPR interventions were assessed, including newer ones based upon IPR, a therapy that enhances negative intrathoracic pressure after each positive pressure breath. Eight anesthetized pigs underwent 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation followed by 2 min each of sequential interventions: (1) conventional standard CPR (STD), (2) automated active compression decompression (ACD) CPR, (3) ACD+ an impedance threshold device (ITD) CPR or (4) ACD+ an intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR) CPR, the latter two representing IPR-based CPR therapies. Intrapleural (Ppl), airway (Paw), right atrial, intracranial, and aortic pressures, along with carotid blood flow and end tidal CO2, were measured and compared during each CPR intervention.

   RESULTS: The lowest mean and decompression phase Ppl were observed with IPR-based therapies [Ppl mean (mean +/- SE): STD (0.8 +/- 1.1 mmHg); ACD (-1.6 +/- 1.6); ACD-ITD (-3.7 +/- 1.5, p < 0.05 vs. both STD and ACD); ACD-ITPR (-7.0 +/- 1.9, p < 0.05 vs. both STD and ACD)] [Ppl decompression (mean +/- SE): STD (-6.3 +/- 2.2); ACD (-13.0 +/- 3.8); ACD-ITD -16.9 +/- 3.6, p < 0.05 vs. both STD and ACD); ACD-ITPR -18.7 +/- 3.5, p < 0.05 vs. both STD and ACD)]. Interventions with the lower mean or decompression phase Ppl also demonstrated lower Paw and were associated with higher vital organ perfusion pressures.

   CONCLUSIONS: IPR-based CPR methods, specifically ACD-ITPR, yielded the most pronounced reduction in both Ppl and Paw and resulted in the most favorable augmentation of hemodynamics during CPR.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare neurologic disorder. It is also known as pseudotumor cerebri. The incidence of IIH is one to two per 100,000 population annually. The higher incidence is in obese women from 15 to 44 years. The main symptoms are headache and visual loss. It mostly affects women of childbearing age who are overweight or obese. There are many theories of pathogenesis of IIH, but precise pathogenesis is unknown. One of the causes of IIH is intracranial venous sinus thrombosis. It can cause increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure by obstruction of venous outflow and blocking of CSF absorption. In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients, thrombogenic tendency is increased due to increased aromatization of testosterone to estradiol which could induce estrogen-mediated thrombophilia. The authors present a 14-year-old girl with PCOS stigma who presented with a severe headache and papilledema. These symptoms were not improved by standard medical therapy of IIH and PCOS, but improved after laparoscopic ovarian drilling. The authors report it with a review of the literature.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of any known causative factor. Most patients with IIH respond to weight reduction, repeated lumbar punctures and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide and topiramate to reduce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production. Despite a number of pathogenetic theories, the cause of IIH remains unknown. With the availability of magnetic resonance (MR) venography and cerebral angiography, venous disease is increasingly being discussed as the etiology of IIH, with a high proportion of patients presenting with nonthrombotic unilateral or bilateral dural venous sinus stenoses. Based on this observation, endovascular stenting of stenotic dural sinuses in patients with IIH has gained popularity. Whether dural venous sinus stenoses are the cause or the consequence of increased ICP is still under debate. In patients with failure of conservative treatment or non-compliance, a more aggressive treatment, such as CSF shunting or surgical optic nerve fenestration, should be performed. For approximately 13 years endovascular stenting of the stenotic sinuses has been used and discussed as an alternative and effective treatment of IIH. Since the first report in 2002, individual cases and case series have been published demonstrating that stents immediately lower the venous pressure gradient, which is associated with clinical improvement. This effect occurs within days or weeks and is permanent in many cases.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A minority of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas progress with time. We sought to determine features that predict progression and define outcomes of patients with progressive dural arteriovenous fistulas.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective imaging and clinical record review of patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula evaluated at our hospital.

   RESULTS: Of 579 patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas, 545 had 1 fistula (mean age, 45 +/- 23 years) and 34 (5.9%) had enlarging, de novo, multiple, or recurrent fistulas (mean age, 53 +/- 20 years; P = .11). Among these 34 patients, 19 had progressive dural arteriovenous fistulas with de novo fistulas or fistula enlargement with time (mean age, 36 +/- 25 years; progressive group) and 15 had multiple or recurrent but nonprogressive fistulas (mean age, 57 +/- 13 years; P = .0059, nonprogressive group). Whereas all 6 children had fistula progression, only 13/28 adults (P = .020) progressed. Angioarchitectural correlates to chronically elevated intracranial venous pressures, including venous sinus dilation (41% versus 7%, P = .045) and pseudophlebitic cortical venous pattern (P = .048), were more common in patients with progressive disease than in those without progression. Patients with progressive disease received more treatments than those without progression (median, 5 versus 3; P = .0068), but as a group, they did not demonstrate worse clinical outcomes (median mRS, 1 and 1; P = .39). However, 3 young patients died from intracranial venous hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage related to progression of their fistulas despite extensive endovascular, surgical, and radiosurgical treatments.

   CONCLUSIONS: Few patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas follow an aggressive, progressive clinical course despite treatment. Younger age at initial presentation and angioarchitectural correlates to venous hypertension may help identify these patients prospectively. Copyright © 2015 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) may result in a chronic debilitating disease. Dural venous sinus stenosis with a physiologic venous pressure gradient has been identified as a potential etiology in a number of IIH patients. Intracranial venous stenting has emerged as a potential treatment alternative.

   METHODS: A systematic review was carried out to identify studies employing venous stenting for IIH.

   RESULTS: From 2002 to 2014, 17 studies comprising 185 patients who underwent 221 stenting procedures were reported. Mean prestent pressure gradient was 20.1 mmHg (95% CI 19.4-20.7 mmHg) with a mean poststent gradient of 4.4 mmHg (95% CI 3.5-5.2 mmHg). Complications occurred in 10 patients (5.4%; 95% CI 4.7-5.4%) but were major in only 3 (1.6%). At a mean clinical follow-up of 22 months, clinical improvement was noted in 130 of 166 patients with headaches (78.3%; 95% CI 75.8-80.8%), 84 of 89 patients with papilledema (94.4%; 95% CI 92.1-96.6%), and 64 of 74 patients with visual symptoms (86.5%; 95% CI 83.0-89.9%). In-stent stenosis was noted in six patients (3.4%; 95% CI 2.5-4.3%) and stent-adjacent stenosis occurred in 19 patients (11.4%; 95% CI 10.4-12.4), resulting in restenting in 10 patients.

   CONCLUSION: In IIH patients with venous sinus stenosis and a physiologic pressure gradient, venous stenting appears to be a safe and effective therapeutic option. Further studies are necessary to determine the long-term outcomes and the optimal management of medically refractory IIH.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Elevated intracranial pressure is one of the most common problems in patients with diverse intracranial disorders, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Effective management for increased intracranial pressure is based mainly on surgical and medical techniques with hyperosmolar therapy as one of the core medical treatments. The study aimed to explore the effects of continuous micro-pump infusions of 3% hypertonic saline combined with furosemide on intracranial pressure control.

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed data on 56 eligible participants with intracranial pressure >20 mmHg from March 2013 to July 2014. The target was to increase and maintain plasma sodium to a level between 145 and 155 mmol/L and osmolarity to a level of 310 to 320 mOsmol/kg.

   RESULTS: Plasma sodium levels significantly increased from 138+/-5 mmol/L at admission to 151+/-3 mmol/L at 24 h (P<0.01). Osmolarity increased from 282+/-11 mOsmol/kg at baseline to 311+/-8 mOsmol/kg at 24 h (P<0.01). Intracranial pressure significantly decreased from 32+/-7 mmHg to 15+/-6 mmHg at 24 h (P<0.01). There was a significant improvement in CPP (P<0.01). Moreover, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and Glasgow Coma Scale slightly increased. However, these changes were not statistically significant.

   CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of 3% hypertonic saline + furosemide is effective and safe for intracranial pressure control.

Abstract
  Paragangliomas that arise from the jugular bulb are known to present as masses in the neck or with hearing loss, pulsatile tinnitus, and lower cranial nerve palsies. Much less recognized is their tendency to cause increased intracranial pressure and papilledema by obstructing jugular venous outflow. Only 7 such cases have been reported and with minimal ophthalmic documentation. We describe 3 more cases to provide additional documentation and to emphasize that paragangliomas are a potential cause of the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, and that papilledema may be overlooked when a jugular paraganglioma is diagnosed or after it has been treated. Such lapses have led to disabling vision loss from damage to the optic nerves in long-standing papilledema.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Successful use of i.v. indomethacin for urgent management of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to acute liver failure is reported.

   SUMMARY: A 42-year-old woman receiving intensive care for fulminant hepatic failure secondary to acetaminophen toxicity developed cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension refractory to standard pharmacotherapy and respiratory support measures. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's head was ordered as part of an evaluation for liver transplantation, but the patient's severely elevated ICP precluded supine positioning for the CT study (throughout the hospital stay, the head of the patient's bed was kept at a 30degree angle to optimize cerebral venous outflow). With administration of indomethacin 10 mg by i.v. injection, the ICP decreased from 29 to 13 mm Hg and remained at goal after the patient was placed in a fully supine position for a period long enough to permit the CT scan. Indomethacin was used a second time to facilitate CT imaging several days later. No adverse effects attributable to indomethacin use were documented. Although the patient underwent successful liver transplantation, her mental status and overall clinical status continued to deteriorate and she died on postoperative day 12.

   CONCLUSION: Despite the poor overall patient outcome in this case, i.v. indomethacin was successfully used to decrease ICP in order to facilitate CT imaging as part of a transplantation eligibility workup.

Abstract
  Patients with multisutural craniosynostosis can develop anomalous venous connections between the intracranial sinuses and cutaneous venous system through enlarged emissary veins. Cranial vault remodeling in this subset of patients carries the risk of massive intraoperative blood loss and/or occlusion of collateral draining veins leading to intracranial venous hypertension and raised intracranial pressure, increasing the morbidity of cranial expansion. The authors report the use of spring-mediated expansion as a technique for cranial reconstruction in which the collateral intracranial venous drainage system can be preserved. A patient with bilateral lambdoid, sagittal, and unicoronal synostosis presented for cranial reconstruction. A tracheostomy and ventriculoperitoneal shunt were placed prior to intervention. At the time of reconstruction, a Luckenschadel skull abnormality and Chiari malformation Type I were present. A preoperative CT venogram demonstrated large collateral superficial occipital veins, small bilateral internal jugular veins, and hypoplastic jugular foramina. Collateral flow from the transverse and sigmoid sinuses through large occipital emissary veins was seen. Spring-mediated cranial vault expansion was performed with care to preserve the large collateral veins at the occipital midline. Four springs were placed at each lambdoid and the posterior and anterior sagittal sutures following 1-cm strip suturectomies. Removal of the springs was performed 2 months postoperatively. Cranial vault expansion was performed without disturbing the aberrant intracranial/extracranial venous collateral system. Estimated blood loss was 150 ml. A CT scan obtained 3 months postoperatively showed resolution of the Luckenschadel deformity and a 40% volumetric increase in the skull compared with the preoperative CT. Patients with anomalous venous drainage patterns and multisutural synostosis can undergo spring-mediated cranial vault expansion while preserving the major emissary veins draining the intracranial sinuses. Risks of blood loss, intracranial venous hypertension, and increased intracranial pressure may be decreased compared with traditional techniques of repair.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Endovascular stenting is an effective treatment for patients with clinically significant cerebral venous sinus stenosis. Traditionally, stenting is indicated in elevated intravenous pressures on conventional venography; however, noninvasive monitoring is more desirable. Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography is an imaging modality that measures blood flow noninvasively. Established in the arterial system, applications to the venous sinuses have been limited.

   OBJECTIVE: To examine quantitative magnetic resonance venography (qMRV) in the measurement of venous sinus flow in patients undergoing endovascular stenting and to identify a relationship with intravenous pressures.

   METHODS: Five patients with intracranial hypertension secondary to venous sinus stenosis underwent cerebral venous stenting between 2009 and 2013 at a single institution. Preoperatively, venous sinus flow was determined by using qMRV, and intravenous pressure was measured during venography. After stenting, intravenous pressure, qMRV flow, and clinical outcomes were assessed and compared.

   RESULTS: A mean prestenotic intravenous pressure of 45.2 mm Hg was recorded before stenting, which decreased to 27.4 mm Hg afterward (Wilcoxon signed rank test P = .04). Total jugular outflow on qMRV increased by 260.2 mL/min. Analysis of the change in intravenous pressure and qMRV flow identified a linear relationship (Pearson correlation r = 0.926). All patients displayed visual improvement at 6 weeks.

   CONCLUSION: Venous outflow by qMRV increases after endovascular stenting and correlates with significantly improved intravenous pressures. These findings introduce qMRV as a potential adjunct to measure venous flow after stenting, and as a plausible tool in the selection and postoperative surveillance of the patient who has cerebral venous sinus stenosis.

Abstract
  The most commonly described indications for surgical management of closed depressed skull fractures are hematoma evacuation and repair of extensive cosmetic deformity. Venous sinus injury, which occurs in a subset of depressed skull fractures, is not typically listed as an indication for surgical treatment due to the potential for major venous hemorrhage associated with surgery near these structures. However, if patients exhibit signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension and radiographic findings demonstrate sinus compromise, surgical elevation of the depressed skull fragments is indicated. The authors present the case of a 25-year-old woman with a depressed skull fracture secondary to a gunshot wound with symptomatic compromise in venous outflow of the posterior one-third of the superior sagittal sinus. The patient was treated with surgical decompression via bilateral craniectomy along with intracranial pressure-lowering medical therapy and had almost full resolution of her presenting symptoms with documented improvement in flow through the superior sagittal sinus. While the use of surgical treatment for these types of injuries is highly debated, the authors demonstrate here that safe, effective surgical management of these patients is possible and that surgical decompression should always be considered in the case of symptomatic venous sinus flow obstruction.

Abstract
  A 30-year-old woman with coexisting renal tubular acidosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), treated with acetazolamide, experienced coning (cerebellar tonsillar herniation) after a lumbar puncture (LP). Brain magnetic resonance imaging at initial diagnosis of IIH showed minor tonsillar descent and computed tomographic venography revealed hypoplasia of the left transverse sinus. The patient previously had three uneventful LPs, all of which showed high opening pressures and normal cerebrospinal fluid composition. In retrospect, it was noted that her serum bicarbonate had fallen to 9 mmol/L (normal: 22-28 mm/L) 1 week before the LP. We hypothesize that the combination of cerebral edema (due to worsening metabolic acidosis), poor venous drainage, and preexisting minor tonsillar descent contributed to her post-LP coning.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is an uncommon but potentially fatal condition. CVST usually occurs young adults with a female predominance. The current mainstay for treating CVST is anticoagulation with heparin. However, more aggressive interventions, endovascular treatment as an example, may be indicated in selected patients who are non-responsive to heparin and other anticoagulants. Endovascular approaches include catheter-based local chemical thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty and mechanical thrombectomy, all of which may rapidly recanalize the occluded venous sinus, restore the blood flow, reduce the increased intracranial pressure, and subsequently relieve the corresponding symptoms. However, as an invasive strategy, endovascular procedures per se may cause complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage, vessel dissection and pulmonary embolization, which may substantially decrease the benefit-risk ratio of the treatment. Due to the rareness of the condition and the limited indication of this invasive strategy, safety and efficacy of endovascular procedures in treating CVST are less feasible to be evaluated in large randomized clinical trails. Therefore, the evidences for justifying this treatment strategy are largely derived from case reports, cohort studies and clinical observations.

Abstract
  This study presents the characteristics that distinguish between idiopathic intracranial hypertension (ICH) and ICH caused by intracranial vascular damage. Twenty-one patients with ICH were included in this study. The analysis of the symptomatology correlated with the values of intracranial pressure, and the imaging findings revealed significant differences between these two types of ICH. ICH caused by intracranial venous vascular damage is named vascular ICH. Vascular ICH has a known etiology, such as cerebral vascular illness, and a relatively rapid increase in intracranial pressure of approximately 21 cmH2O and imaging findings show characteristic images of thrombosis or stenosis of the intracranial venous system, while all brain images (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, angio-magnetic resonance imaging) are normal in idiopathic ICH. The treatment of vascular ICH is etiologic, pathogenic, and symptomatic, but that of idiopathic ICH is only symptomatic. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier Taiwan.

Abstract
  Brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in children and adults in their most productive years. Use of intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) to generate negative intrathoracic pressure during the expiratory phase of positive pressure ventilation improves mean arterial pressure and 24-h survival in porcine models of hemorrhagic shock and cardiac arrest and has been demonstrated to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in these models. Application of IPR for 240 min in a porcine model of intracranial hypertension (ICH) will increase CPP when compared with controls. Twenty-three female pigs were subjected to focal brain injury by insertion of an epidural Foley catheter inflated with 3 mL of saline. Animals were randomized to treatment for 240 min with IPR set to a negative expiratory phase pressure of -12 cmH2O or no IPR therapy. Intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, CPP, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were evaluated. Intrathoracic pressure regulation significantly improved mean CPP and CBF. Specifically, mean CPP after 90, 120, 180, and 240 min of IPR use was 43.7 +/- 2.8 mmHg, 44.0 +/- 2.7 mmHg, 44.5 +/- 2.8 mmHg, and 43.1 +/- 1.9 mmHg, respectively; a significant increase from ICH study baseline (39.5 +/- 1.7 mmHg) compared with control animals in which mean CPP was 36.7 +/- 1.4 mmHg (ICH study baseline) and then 35.9 +/- 2.1 mmHg, 33.7 +/- 2.8 mmHg, 33.9 +/- 3.0 mmHg, and 36.0 +/- 2.7 mmHg at 90, 120, 180, and 240 min, respectively (P < 0.05 for all time points). Cerebral blood flow, as measured by an invasive CBF probe, increased in the IPR group (34 +/- 4 mL/100 g-min to 49 +/- 7 mL/100 g-min at 90 min) but not in controls (27 +/- 1 mL/100 g-min to 25 +/- 5 mL/100 g-min at 90 min) (P = 0.01). Arterial pH remained unchanged during the entire period of IPR compared with baseline values and control values. In this anesthetized pig model of ICH, treatment with IPR significantly improved CPP and CBF. This therapy may be of clinical value by noninvasively improving cerebral perfusion in states of compromised cerebral perfusion.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Jugular oxygen saturation monitoring was introduced in neurointensive care after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) to explore the adequacy of brain perfusion and guide therapeutic interventions. The brain was considered homogeneous, and oxygen saturation was taken as representative of the whole organ. We investigated whether venous outflow from the brain was homogeneous by measuring oxygen saturation simultaneously from the two jugular veins.

   METHODS: In 32 comatose TBI patients both internal jugular veins (IJs) were simultaneously explored using intermittent samples; hemoglobin saturation was also recorded continuously by fiber-optic catheters in five patients. In five cases long catheters were inserted bilaterally upstream, up to the sigmoid sinuses.

   MAIN FINDINGS: On average, measurements from the two sides were in agreement (mean and standard deviation of the differences between the saturation of the two IJs were respectively 5.32 and 5.15). However, 15 patients showed differences of more than 15 % in hemoglobin saturation at some point; three others showed differences larger than 10 %. No relationship was found between the computed tomographic scan data and the hemoglobin saturation pattern.

   DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Several groups have confirmed differences between oxygen saturation in the two jugular veins. After years of enthusiasm, interest for jugular saturation has decreased and more modern methods, such as tissue oxygenation monitoring, are now available. Jugular saturation monitoring has low sensitivity, with the risk of missing low saturation, but high specificity; moreover it is cheap, when used with intermittent sampling. Monitoring the adequacy of brain perfusion after severe TBI is essential. However the choice of a specific monitor depends on local resources and expertise.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few studies have examined collateral formation in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of baseline intracranial venous collaterals on the clinical outcome and imaging features of patients with acute CVT.

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: MRIs from consecutive patients with acute CVT were retrospectively analysed. The category system described by Qureshi was used to assess the pattern of venous collaterals. Clinical and imaging features and outcomes were analysed using bivariate and multivariate models to assess the association of collateral patterns with the type of parenchymal lesions and clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at 30 and 90 days.

   RESULTS: One hundred patients were included (77 women; median age 32 years; and median of 18 months of follow-up). Venous collaterals were present in 88% of the patients; type I collaterals in 3 patients, type II collaterals in 27 patients, and type III collaterals in 58 patients. Twelve patients did not exhibit any collaterals. Cohen's kappa coefficient between evaluators was 0.86. In the bivariate analysis, type III collaterals were associated with isolated intracranial hypertension and complete recovery, whereas type I collaterals were associated with encephalopathy. However, in the multivariate regression analysis, the collateral pattern was not associated with clinical presentation, type of brain lesion or outcome.

   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial venous collaterals are frequently found in patients with CVT during the acute phase. However, they do not have an independent effect on the type of brain damage, clinical manifestations or prognosis. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Seven astronauts after 6-mo missions to the International Space Station showed unexpected vision problems. Lumbar punctures performed in the four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal fluid pressure after returning to Earth. We hypothesized that lower body negative pressure (LBNP) imposed during head-down tilt (HDT) would reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) and transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitude, a noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) surrogate.

   METHODS: Participating in this study were 25 normal healthy nonsmoking volunteers (mean age: 36 yr). Subjects were positioned supine (5 min), sitting (5 min), 15degree whole body HDT (5 min), and 10 min of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg). The order of HDT and HDT+LBNP tests was balanced. Right and left IOP, transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitude, arm blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the last minute (steady state) of each testing condition.

   RESULTS: IOP significantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg (mean +/- SD: N = 25), and increased by 0.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg from supine to the HDT position. LBNP during HDT significantly lowered IOP to supine levels. In addition, LBNP significantly reduced transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitudes by 38% as compared to the HDT condition (N = 9). Sitting mean blood pressure (BP) was significantly higher (+5 mmHg) than BP values after 10 min of LBNP during HDT. However, heart rate was not significantly different across all conditions.

   DISCUSSION: These data suggest that short duration exposures to LBNP attenuate HDT-induced increases in IOP and ICP. Macias BR, Liu JHK, Grande-Gutierrez N, Hargens AR. Intraocular and intracranial pressures during head-down tilt with lower body negative pressure.

Abstract
  Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is a life-threatening complication of central nervous system (CNS) injuries. This review summarizes current knowledge about NPE etiology and pathophysiology with an emphasis on its experimental models, including our spinal cord compression model. NPE may develop as a result of activation of specific CNS trigger zones located in the brainstem, leading to a rapid sympathetic discharge, rise in systemic blood pressure, baroreflex-induced bradycardia, and enhanced venous return resulting in pulmonary vascular congestion characterized by interstitial edema, intra-alveolar accumulation of transudate, and intra-alveolar hemorrhages. The potential etiological role of neurotransmitter changes in NPE trigger zones leading to enhanced sympathetic nerve activity is discussed. Degree of anesthesia is a crucial determinant for the extent of NPE development in experimental models because of its influence on sympathetic nervous system activity. Sympathetic hyperactivity is based on the major activation of either ascending spinal pathways by spinal cord injury or NPE trigger zones by increased intracranial pressure. Attenuation of sympathetic nerve activity or abolition of reflex bradycardia completely prevent NPE development in our experimental model. Suggestions for future research into NPE pathogenesis as well as therapeutic potential of particular drugs and interventions are discussed.

Abstract
  Intracranial pial arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are rare cerebrovascular lesions. The authors report a rare case of pediatric pial AVF treated by direct disconnection with the aid of indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography. A 3-year-old girl presented with developmental problems. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed brain atrophy and an anomalous left temporal vascular mass. Angiography showed a high-flow pial AVF in the early arterial phase fed by the M1 portion of the left middle cerebral artery and draining into the superficial sylvian vein and the vein of Trolard with a large varix. Given that her fistula was located in a superficial region that was easily accessible by craniotomy, the authors successfully disconnected her pial AVF by direct surgery aided by ICG videoangiography, which clearly confirmed the shunting point. In this report, the authors discuss the existing literature and compare the relative merits of endovascular versus surgical options for the treatment of pial AVF.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) when no underlying etiology is found, is a clinical syndrome characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) (>25 cm H2O), which may lead to headaches and visual symptoms. In patients with IIH who are found to have transverse sinus stenosis, placement of a venous stent across the stenosis has been shown to lower ICP and to resolve the symptoms in several case series, with generally favorable results. In this study, we examine common risk factors associated with failure of transvenous stenting for IIH. If venous sinus stenting fails, CSF diversion should be considered as the next line of treatment.

   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of eighteen patients diagnosed with IIH who underwent venous sinus stenting for transverse sinus stenosis with a mean pressure gradient (MPG) of at least 4 mmHg. Fifteen of these patients did not need further treatment. We compared their pre- and post-treatment, neurological and neuro-ophthalmological evaluations to the three patients who went on to have a shunt placement as a second line treatment.

   RESULTS: Shunting after stent placement patients (n=3) had a mean age of 30 years and a mean body mass index of 36.6 kg/m(2), whereas the group that underwent stent placement alone (n=15) had a mean age of 40.7 years and a mean body mass index of 33.3 kg/m(2). In the shunting after stent placement group, the mean opening pressure on the most recent lumbar puncture obtained prior to any intervention was 50 cm of H2O, whereas the group that underwent stent placement alone had an opening CSF pressure of 37 cm of H2O which was statistically significant (p<0.05). There were no other significant differences in pre- or post-intervention factors between the two groups.

   CONCLUSION: In patients with IIH and documented evidence of venous sinus stenosis with a pressure gradient, venous sinus stenting should be the primary treatment of choice; however, some patients may be refractory to stenting and still require permanent CSF diversion, which can be complicated in these chronically anticoagulated patients. Patients with persistent papilledema post-stenting and highly elevated opening pressure pre-stenting should be followed closely as they are at greatest risk of requiring a shunt and failing stenting.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome contribute significantly to increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. This study describes pathophysiologic effects of the acutely elevated intra-abdominal pressure on microvascular fluid exchange and microcirculation. The resulting changes could contribute to development of organ dysfunction or failure.

   METHODS: 16 pigs were randomly allocated to a control-group (C-group) or an interventional group (P-group). After 60 min of stabilization, intra-abdominal pressure of the P-group animals was elevated to 15 mmHg by Helium insufflation and after 120 min to a level of 30 mmHg for two more hours. The C-group animals were observed without insufflation of gas. Laboratory and hemodynamic parameters, plasma volume, plasma colloid osmotic pressure, total tissue water content, tissue perfusion, markers of inflammation and cerebral energy metabolism were measured and net fluid balance and fluid extravasation rates calculated. Analysis of variance for repeated measurements with post-tests were used to evaluate the results with respect to differences within or between the groups.

   RESULTS: In the C-group hematocrit, net fluid balance, plasma volume and the fluid extravasation rate remained essentially unchanged throughout the study as opposed to the increase in hematocrit (P < 0.001), fluid extravasation rate (P < 0.05) and decrease in plasma volume (P < 0.001) of the P-group. Hemodynamic parameters remained stable or were slightly elevated in the C-group while the P-group demonstrated an increase in femoral venous pressure (P < 0.001), right atrial pressure (P < 0.001), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (P < 0.01) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (P < 0.001). The protein mass decreased in both study groups but was significantly lower in the P-group as compared with the C-group, after 240 min of intervention. The increased intra-abdominal pressure was associated with elevated intracranial pressure and reduced tissue perfusion of the pancreas and the gastric- and intestinal mucosa.

   CONCLUSION: Elevation of intra-abdominal pressure has an immediate impact on microvascular fluid extravasation leading to plasma volume contraction, reduced cardiac output and deranged perfusion of abdominal organs.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: The combination of the LUCAS 2 (L-CPR) automated CPR device and an impedance threshold device (ITD) has been widely implemented in the clinical field. This animal study tested the hypothesis that the addition of an ITD on L-CPR would enhance cerebral and coronary perfusion pressures.

   METHODS: Ten female pigs (39.0 +/- 2.0 kg) were sedated, intubated, anesthetized with isofluorane, and paralyzed with succinylcholine (93.3 mcg/kg/min) to inhibit the potential confounding effect of gasping. After 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation, 4 min of L-CPR+an active ITD or L-CPR+a sham ITD was initiated and followed by another 4 min of the alternative method of CPR. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), diastolic right atrial pressure (RAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), airway pressure, and end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) were recorded continuously. Data expressed as mean mmHg +/- SD.

   RESULTS: Decompression phase airway pressure was significantly lower with L-CPR+active ITD versus L-CPR+sham ITD (-5.3 +/- 2.2 vs. -0.5 +/- 0.6; p<0.001). L-CPR+active ITD treatment resulted in significantly improved hemodynamics versus L-CPR+sham ITD: ETCO2, 35 +/- 6 vs. 29 +/- 7 (p=0.015); SBP, 99 +/- 9 vs. 93 +/- 15 (p=0.050); DBP, 24 +/- 12 vs. 19 +/- 15 (p=0.006); coronary perfusion pressure, 29 +/- 8 vs. 26 +/- 7 (p=0.004) and cerebral perfusion pressure, 24 +/- 13 vs. 21 +/- 12 (p=0.028).

   CONCLUSIONS: In pigs undergoing L-CPR the addition of the active ITD significantly reduced intrathoracic pressure and increased vital organ perfusion pressures. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Acute thrombosis of cerebral veins and sinuses (ATCVS) is a multifactorial disease with grave consequences. Because of its rare occurrence there are no proven treatment guidelines. Sixteen patients with ATCVS were treated. The final diagnosis was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography. Sinus catheterization was performed via transfemoral venous access. Treatment included mechanical manipulation of thrombi and thrombolytic therapy. A regression of clinical symptoms with a concomitant decrease of intracranial hypertension was achieved in all patients. Long-term results were studied in eight patients: none presented clinical signs of intracranial hypertension. Endovascular transvenous recanalization is an effective treatment for acute thrombosis of cerebral veins and sinuses. Along with the local thrombolysis, significant potential in the treatment of this complex pathology lies in the transvenous endovascular techniques of mechanical thrombus extraction, especially in patients with intracranial hemorrhage for whom the use of thrombolytic agents is restricted.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Central venous catheters are frequently used as access for hemodialysis (HD) in children. One of the known complications is central venous stenosis. Although this complication is not rare, it is often asymptomatic and therefore unacknowledged. Superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis is obviously suspected in the presence of upper body edema, but several other signs and symptoms are often unrecognized as being part of this syndrome.

   CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: We describe four patients with various manifestations of central venous stenosis and SVC syndrome. These sometimes life- or organ-threatening conditions include obstructive sleep apnea, unresolving stridor, increased intracranial pressure, increased intraocular pressure, right-sided pleural effusion, protein-losing enteropathy and lymphadenopathy. The temporal relationship of these complications associated with the use of central venous catheters and documentation of venous stenosis, together with their resolution after alleviation of high venous pressure, points to a causal role. We suggest pathophysiological mechanisms for the formation of each of these complications.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with occlusion of the SVC, various unexpected clinical entities can be caused by high central venous pressure. As often the etiology is not obvious, a high index of suspicion is needed as in some cases prompt alleviation of the high pressure is mandatory.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: We present an unusual complication following robotic assisted radical hysterectomy.

   CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old female with stage 1B1 cervical cancer underwent a robotic assisted radical hysterectomy. The procedure was prolonged with difficulties dissecting the left parametrium and vaginal fornix with persistent bleeding from the left vaginal vault. Post-operatively the patient was electively sedated and ventilated. Extubation was difficult due to patient agitation but achieved on day 2. Agitation persisted and a head CT scan was performed and a diagnosis of cerebral oedema was made.

   DISCUSSION: Factors contributing to this case include prolonged operating time, prolonged Trendelenburg position with high pressures of CO2 pneumoperitoneum and excessive blood loss. These factors may contribute to poor cerebral venous outflow, increasing intracranial pressure leading to increased risk of cerebral oedema.

   CONCLUSION: The mechanics of robotic assistance may be used to reduce these risks by significantly reducing intra-abdominal pressure improving venous return. The use of robotics in surgery has been increasing over the last 10 years, and the benefits have been well documented. We present an unusual complication following robotic assisted radical hysterectomy performed for cervical cancer.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate intracranial pressure and associated hemo- and hydrodynamic parameters in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations AVMs.

   METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients with arteriovenous malformations (median age 38.7 years, 27/30 previously treated with radiosurgery) and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were investigated on a 3.0T MR scanner. Nidus volume was quantified on dynamic MR angiography. Total arterial cerebral blood flow (tCBF), venous outflow as well as aqueductal and craniospinal stroke volumes were obtained using velocity-encoded cine-phase contrast MRI. Intracranial volume change during the cardiac cycle was calculated and intracranial pressure (ICP) was derived from systolic intracranial volume change (ICVC) and pulse pressure gradient.

   RESULTS: TCBF was significantly higher in AVM patients as compared to healthy controls (median 799 vs. 692 mL/min, p=0.007). There was a trend for venous flow to be increased in both the ipsilateral internal jugular vein (IJV, 282 vs. 225 mL/min, p=0.16), and in the contralateral IJV (322 vs. 285 mL/min, p=0.09), but not in secondary veins. There was no significant difference in median ICP between AVM patients and control subjects (6.9 vs. 8.6 mmHg, p=0.30) and ICP did not correlate with nidus volume in AVM patients (rho=-0.06, p=0.74). There was a significant positive correlation between tCBF and craniospinal CSF stroke volume (rho=0.69, p=0.02).

   CONCLUSIONS: The elevated cerebral blood flow in patients with AVMs is drained through an increased flow in IJVs but not secondary veins. ICP is maintained within ranges of normal and does not correlate with nidus volume. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Concern has been raised that cervical collars may increase intracranial pressure in traumatic brain injury. The purpose of this study was to compare four types of cervical collars regarding efficacy of immobilizing the neck, effect on jugular venous pressure (JVP), as a surrogate for possible effect on intracranial pressure, and patient comfort in healthy volunteers.

   METHODS: The characteristics of four widely used cervical collars (Laerdal Stifneck( R) (SN), Vista( R) (VI), Miami J Advanced( R) (MJ), Philadelphia( R) (PH)) were studied in ten volunteers. Neck movement was measured with goniometry, JVP was measured directly through an endovascular catheter and participants graded the collars according to comfort on a scale 1-5.

   RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 27 +/- 5 yr and BMI 26 +/- 5. The mean neck movement (53 +/- 9degree) decreased significantly with all the collars (p < 0.001) from 18 +/- 7degree to 25 +/- 9degree (SN < MJ < PH < VI). There was a significant increase in mean JVP (9.4 +/- 1.4 mmHg) with three of the collars, but not with SN, from 10.5 +/- 2.1 mmHg to 16.3 +/- 3.3 mmHg (SN < MJ < VI < PH). The grade of comfort between collars varied from 4.2 +/- 0.8 to 2.2 +/- 0.8 (VI > MJ > SN > PH).

   CONCLUSION: Stifneck and Miami J collars offered the most efficient immobilization of the neck with the least effect on JVP. Vista and Miami J were the most comfortable ones. The methodology used in this study may offer a new approach to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of neck collars and aid their continued development.

Abstract
  The co-occurrence of epistaxis and headache is not uncommon in migraine patients, although only few case reports have been published. A trigeminovascular activation may be causally involved although the exact mechanisms linking epistaxis and migraine remain unclear. Significant dural sinus stenosis may sustain or worsen an increased cerebral venous pressure and is considered a radiological predictor of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. We report a 49-year-old female patient with chronic migraine associated to stabbing headache-like attacks followed by epistaxis and by the resolution or the significant improvement of pain. As she also reported adjunctive symptoms suggestive of raised intracranial pressure and showed a bilateral narrowing of transverse sinuses at MR-venography, a possible intracranial hypertension was hypothesized despite the lack of papilledema. Acetazolamide 250 mg twice/day was added to therapy and the patient reported sudden reduction of headache severity and frequency and complete resolution of both the stabbing pain and the recurrent epistaxis, maintained for 5 months. At treatment discontinuation she complained the worsening of migraine headache and the reoccurrence of the superimposed stabbing pain followed by epistaxis. The mechanism linking the sequential occurrence of painful stabs, epistaxis and relief from pain with raised intracranial pressure in our patients remains unclear. We speculate that the sudden reopening of collapsed collateral veins of the anterior venous circle, possibly prompted by periodic waves of central venous hypertension coupled with intracranial hypertensive peaks, could explain the unusual strict time succession of painful stabs, epistaxis, and subsequent resolution of pain.

Abstract
  In recent years the efficacy of endovascular venous stenting in idiopathic IIH treatment has been consistently reported, strongly suggesting that sinus stenosis should be viewed as a causative factor rather than a secondary phenomenon. We propose that in subjects carrying one or more collapsible segments of large cerebral venous collectors and exposed to a number of different promoting factors, sinus venous compression and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypertension may influence each other in a circular way, leading to a new relatively stable venous/CSF pressures balance state at higher values. The mechanism relay on self-limiting venous collapse (SVC) feedback-loop between the CSF pressure, that compresses the sinus, and the consequent venous pressure rise, that increases the CSF pressure. The result is the "coupled" increase of both pressure values, a phenomenon not expected in presence of sufficiently rigid central veins. Once the maximum stretch of venous wall is reached the loop stabilize at higher venous/CSF pressure values and become self-sustaining, therefore persisting even after the ceasing of the promoting factor. Notably, the SVC is reversible provided an adequate perturbation is carried to whichever side of the loop such as sinus venous stenting, on one hand, and CSF diversion or even a single CSF withdrawal by lumbar puncture (LP), on the other. The SVC model predicts that any condition leading to an increase of either, cerebral venous pressure or CSF pressure may trigger the feedback loop in predisposed individuals. Migraine with and without aura, a disease sharing with IIH a much higher prevalence among women of childbearing age, is associated with waves of significant brain hyperperfusion. These may lead to the congestion of large cerebral venous collectors and could represent a common SVC promoting condition in susceptible individuals. The SVC model give reason of the high specificity and sensitivity of sinus stenosis as IIH predictor and of the multiplicity of the factors that have been found associated with IIH. Moreover it might explain why, among the sinus stenosis carriers, young and overweight women are at higher risk of developing the disease. Finally, the SVC model fully explain the enigmatic longstanding remissions that can be commonly observed after a single LP with CSF subtraction in IIH with or without papilledema.

Abstract
  Intracranial hypertension is a severe therapeutic problem, as there is insufficient knowledge about the physiology of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. In this paper a new CSF pressure regulation hypothesis is proposed. According to this hypothesis, the CSF pressure depends on the laws of fluid mechanics and on the anatomical characteristics inside the cranial and spinal space, and not, as is today generally believed, on CSF secretion, circulation and absorption. The volume and pressure changes in the newly developed CSF model, which by its anatomical dimensions and basic biophysical features imitates the craniospinal system in cats, are compared to those obtained on cats with and without the blockade of craniospinal communication in different body positions. During verticalization, a long-lasting occurrence of negative CSF pressure inside the cranium in animals with normal cranio-spinal communication was observed. CSF pressure gradients change depending on the body position, but those gradients do not enable unidirectional CSF circulation from the hypothetical site of secretion to the site of absorption in any of them. Thus, our results indicate the existence of new physiological/pathophysiological correlations between intracranial fluids, which opens up the possibility of new therapeutic approaches to intracranial hypertension.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Isolated cortical vein thrombosis is a distinct subtype of cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis. Because of the rarity of isolated cortical vein thrombosis, limited knowledge on its clinical and radiological manifestations is available.

   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published data. Isolated cortical vein thrombosis had to have been diagnosed by MRI, conventional angiography, computed tomography venography, autopsy, or surgery. Cases with concurrent thrombosis of a cerebral sinus were excluded.

   RESULTS: Of 175 potentially relevant studies, 47 were included in the analysis, with a total of 116 patients. All studies were case reports and case series. Mean age was 41 years and 68% were women. The most common symptoms were headache (71%), seizures (58%), and focal neurological deficits (62%). Papilledema was not reported in any patient, and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure was reported only in 2. Infection (19%), pregnancy or puerperium (35% of women), and oral contraceptive use (21% of women) were the most common risk factors. Most cases (73%) were diagnosed with MRI, but conventional angiography was also performed in 47%. A total of 81% had a parenchymal brain lesion and 80% were treated with anticoagulation. In-hospital mortality was 6%.

   CONCLUSIONS: Signs of increased intracranial pressure seem to be less common in isolated cortical vein thrombosis compared with cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis. MRI and in some cases conventional angiography are the most frequently used diagnostic modalities and anticoagulation is the most widely used therapy.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Intracranial pressure changes during head impact cause brain injuries such as vasogenic edema and cerebral contusion. However, the influence of impulsive pressure on endothelial function has not yet been fully studied in vitro. In this study, we developed a pressure loading device that produced positive and negative pressures by modifying an in vitro fluid percussion model and examined the effects of the amplitude and duration of the pressures on endothelial permeability.

   METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were subjected to three types of positive pressure (average amplitude/average duration of 352 kPa/23 ms, 73 kPa/27 ms, and 70 kPa/44 ms) and three types of negative pressure (-72 kPa/41 ms, -67 kPa/104 ms, and -91 kPa/108 ms), and the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured between 15 min and 24 h after pressure loading for quantifying the formation of an integral monolayer of endothelial cells. After loading, vascular endothelial- (VE-) cadherin, an endothelium-specific cell-cell adhesion molecule involved in endothelial barrier function, was stained and observed using fluorescence microscopy.

   RESULTS: The pressure loading device could produce positive pressure pulses with amplitudes of 53-1348 kPa and durations of 9-29.1 ms and negative pressure pulses with amplitudes of -52 - -93 kPa and durations of 42.9-179.5 ms. The impulsive pressure reduced the TEER associated with the change in VE-cadherin localization. Additionally, TEER decreased considerably at 15 min and 6 h post-loading, with these changes being significant in positive pressure with larger amplitude and shorter duration and in all types of negative pressures compared to pre-loading.

   CONCLUSIONS: The changes in intracranial pressure during head impact impair endothelial barrier function by the disruption of the integrity of endothelial cell-cell junctions, and the degree of increase in endothelial permeability depends on the amplitude, duration, and direction (compressive and tensile) of the impulsive pressure.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Intracranial pressure (ICP) control is a mainstay of traumatic brain injury (TBI) management. However, development of intracranial hypertension (ICH) may be affected by factors outside of the cranial vault in addition to the local effects of the TBI. This review will examine the pathophysiology of multiple compartment syndrome (MCS) and current treatment considerations for patients with TBI given the effects of MCS.

   RECENT FINDINGS: Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is associated with ICP elevation, and decompressive laparotomy in patients with concurrent elevations in IAP and ICP can reduce ICP. Elevated intrathoracic pressure may be similarly associated with ICP elevation, although the ideal ventilator management strategy for TBI patients when considering MCS is unclear.

   SUMMARY: In MCS, intracranial, intrathoracic and intra-abdominal compartment pressures are interrelated. TBI patient care should include ICP control as well as minimization of intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure as clinically possible.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: One of the major goals of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is to provide adequate oxygen delivery to the brain for minimizing cerebral injury resulted from cardiac arrest. The optimal chest compression during CPR should effectively improve brain perfusion without compromising intracranial pressure (ICP). Our previous study has demonstrated that the miniaturized mechanical chest compressor improved hemodynamic efficacy and the success of CPR. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the miniaturized chest compressor (MCC) on calculated cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP) and ICP.

   METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced and untreated for 7min in 13 male domestic pigs weighing 39+/-3kg. The animals were randomized to receive mechanical chest compression with the MCC (n=7), or the Thumper device (n=6). CPR was performed for 5min before defibrillation attempt by a single 150J shock. At 2.5min of CPR, the epinephrine at a dose of 20mcg/kg was administered. Additional epinephrine was administered at an interval of 3min thereafter. If resuscitation was not successful, CPR was resumed for an additional 2min prior to the next defibrillation until successful resuscitation or for a total of 15min. Post-resuscitated animals were observed for 2h.

   RESULTS: Significantly greater intrathoracic positive and negative pressures during compression and decompression phases of CPR were observed with the MCC when compared with the Thumper device. The MCC produced significantly greater coronary perfusion pressure and end-tidal carbon dioxide. There were no statistically significant differences in systolic and mean ICP between the two groups; however, both of the measurements were slightly greater in the MCC treated animals. Interestingly, the diastolic ICP was significantly lower in the MCC group, which was closely related to the significantly lower negative intrathoracic pressure in the animals that received the MCC. Most important, systolic, diastolic and mean calculated CerPP were all significantly greater in the animals receiving the MCC.

   CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, mechanical chest compression with the MCC significantly improved calculated CerPP but did not compromise ICP during CPR. It may provide a safe and effective chest compression during CPR. Protocol number: P1205. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Dural arteriovenous fistulas are abnormal connections of dural arteries to dural veins or venous sinuses originating from within the dural leaflets. They are usually located near or within the wall of a dural venous sinus that is frequently obstructed or stenosed. The dural fistula sac is contained within the dural leaflets, and drainage can be via a dural sinus or retrograde through cortical veins (leptomeningeal drainage). Dural arteriovenous fistulas can occur at any dural sinus but are found most frequently at the cavernous or transverse sinus. Leptomeningeal venous drainage can lead to venous hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage. The various treatment options include transarterial and transvenous embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery, and open surgery. Although many of the advances in dural arteriovenous fistula treatment have occurred in the endovascular arena, open microsurgical advances in the past decade have primarily been in the tools available to the surgeon. Improvements in microsurgical and skull base approaches have allowed surgeons to approach and obliterate fistulas with little or no retraction of the brain. Image-guided systems have also allowed better localization and more efficient approaches. A better understanding of the need to simply obliterate the venous drainage at the site of the fistula has eliminated the riskier resections of the past. Finally, the use of intraoperative angiography or indocyanine green videoangiography confirms the complete disconnection of fistula while the patient is still on the operating room table, preventing reoperation for residual fistulas.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The use of thrombolytics is frequently considered in patients with cerebral venous and dural sinus thrombosis (CVT) who deteriorate despite anticoagulant therapy.

   PURPOSE: To collect all the published information about the use of systemic thrombolysis in CVT in order to assess its efficacy and safety.

   METHODS: We performed a PubMed search, checked all reference lists of studies found and used data from the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT). Outcome was classified at the last available follow-up by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The cases were stratified according to variables that might influence outcome.

   RESULTS: A total of 16 reports (26 patients, 2 from the ISCVT and 24 from the systematic review of the literature) were included. No randomized clinical trial was found. Seven patients presented with isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome (26.9%), 17 with encephalopathy (65.4%) and 2 were comatose (7.7%). The superior sagittal sinus was the one most often affected (n = 21; 80.8%), and there was thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system in 5 patients (19.2%). Urokinase was the thrombolytic agent most frequently administered (n = 19; 73.1%), whereas streptokinase and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator were used in 2 cases each (7.7%). Intracranial hemorrhages occurred in 3 cases (11.5%). Extracranial hemorrhages occurred in 5 cases (19.2%), and overall there were 3 cases of serious bleeding (11.5%), including 2 deaths (7.7%). Partial or complete recanalization was verified in most patients (n = 16; 61.5%). The survival rate was 92.3% (24/26 patients). At the last available follow-up, 22/25 patients regained independency (mRS scores 0-2; 88%), 2/25 died (mRS score 6; 8%) and 1/25 was severely dependent (mRS scores 3-5; 4%).

   CONCLUSIONS: In all, 88% of the CVT patients treated with systemic thrombolysis regained their independency, but 2 deaths associated with intracranial hemorrhage occurred. The mortality rate and disability at the last available follow-up were similar to those found in 2 previous systematic reviews concerning the use of thrombolytics in CVT. Due to the small sample size and lack of controls, the efficacy of systemic thrombolysis in acute CVT cannot be assessed from the published information. Concerning safety, a nonnegligible proportion of bleedings was reported. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The efficacy of cerebrospinal fluid shunting to reduce intracranial hypertension and prevent fatal brain herniation in acute cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is unknown.

   METHOD: From the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT) and a systematic literature review, we retrieved acute CVT patients treated only with shunting (external ventricular drain, ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculojugular shunt). Outcome was classified at 6 months and final follow-up by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).

   RESULTS: 15 patients were collected (9 from the ISCVT and 6 from the review) who were treated with a shunt (external ventricular drain in 6 patients, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in 8 patients or an unspecified type of shunt in another one). Eight patients (53.3%) regained independence (mRS 0-2), while 2 patients (13.3%) were left with a severe handicap (mRS 4-6) and 4 (26.7%) died despite treatment. Five patients with parenchymal lesions were shunted within 48 h from admission deterioration, 4 with an external ventricular drain: 2 (40%) recovered to independence, 2 (40%) had a severe handicap and 1 (20%) died. In contrast, all 3 patients with intracranial hypertension and no parenchymal lesions receiving a ventriculoperitoneal shunt later than 48 h regained independence.

   CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: A quarter of acute CVT patients treated with a shunt died, and only half regained independence. With the limitation of the small number of subjects, this review suggests that shunting does not appear to be effective in preventing death from brain herniation in acute CVT. We cannot exclude that shunting may benefit patients with sustained intracranial hypertension and no parenchymal lesions. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Negative-pressure hydrocephalus (NegPH) is a rare clinical entity characterised by enlarged ventricles and symptoms consistent with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in the setting of negative ICP. Little has been published regarding appropriate treatment and outcomes of negative-pressure hydrocephalus patients, and no data have been published demonstrating successful therapy producing acceptable long-term outcomes. Here we present 8 cases successfully treated by titrated external ventricular drainage (TEVD), including drainage at negative (subatmospheric) pressure, and subsequent low-pressure ventriculoperitoneal shunting.

   METHODS: A retrospective audit of all cases of negative-pressure hydrocephalus occurring at a university teaching hospital between 2006 and 2012 was undertaken. The clinical features of these cases, results of radiological investigations, treatment, and outcome were drawn from the patients' records.

   RESULTS: Eight cases of NegPH were identified. All patients had at least one preceding intracranial procedure (mean number of procedures 3.0). All cases were treated using TEVD, titrated to produce between 5 and 15 mL per hour of CSF drainage, including drainage under subatmospheric pressure if this was required to maintain CSF flow. Mean delay from first negative ICP to TEVD was 1.8 days. All 8 patients demonstrated clinical improvement. TEVD resulted in improvement in Glasgow Coma Scale (mean increase 4.6, p=0.003), and increases in ICP (mean increase 8.5, p<0.001). Mean length of follow-up was 471.8 days. At follow-up, four patients had returned to pre-morbid functioning, three had a reduction in functioning attributable to their initial presentation (not NegPH), and one had died of unknown cause. Illustrative case descriptions are included.

   CONCLUSIONS: Negative-pressure hydrocephalus is a rare but underrecognised syndrome that can be successfully treated by timely external ventricular drainage titrated to maintain CSF flow, and subsequent low-pressure ventriculoperitoneal shunting.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a variety of intracranial hypertension that is extremely rare in men. Obesity and hypogonadism are the most important predictive factors. Etiological hypotheses include increased central venous pressure, and various hormonal and metabolic changes commonly found in obese patients. We described the case of an obese man with prostate cancer who showed a consistent bodyweight increase during treatment with taxanes and prednisone. He was hospitalized because of a severe loss of vision as a consequence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A complete symptom remission was obtained after 3 weeks of anti-edema therapies (steroids, acetazolamide). Castration-resistant prostate cancer is a risk factor for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Long-term androgen deprivation therapy, bodyweight increase, and fluid retention during chronic steroid administration and taxane chemotherapy might favor the disease onset. This severe complication has a good outcome, and should be suspected in the presence of symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension. Copyright © 2013 The Japanese Urological Association.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare condition with various clinical presentations which may delay diagnosis. It is frequently associated with severe consequences. We present the first documented case of thrombosis of the great cerebral vein in a hemodialysis patient. A 29-year-old female patient with end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology was admitted to a hospital with altered consciousness and nausea. Severe headache in the right parietal area had started 2 days before. On examination, she was in the poor overall condition, dysartric, with a severe nystagmus. Urgent brain multislice computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed thrombosis of the great cerebral vein with hypodense zones in hypothalamus, thalamus and basal ganglia. She was treated with heparin bolus of 25000 IU with a favorable outcome. Detailed examination demonstrated increased lupus anticoagulant (LA) 1 and LA2 and increased LA1/LA2. Control magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 year later revealed multiple vascular lesions within the brain. Acetylsalicylate was introduced in therapy. Thrombosis of the cerebral veins should be suspected in patients with end-stage renal disease, altered neurological status and signs of increased intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  Headache is a clinical diagnosis linked to a number of medical and surgical disorders. A common etiology has not yet been established. It would seem that these cases can be related to some degree of cerebral venous outflow obstruction. We report 2 cases of chronic superior sagittal sinus thrombosis causing isolated intracranial hypertension. The patients were treated with intrasinus thrombolytic therapy. Copyright © 2014.

Abstract
  Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a syndrome of low pressure headache associated with low CSF pressure. The condition is generally considered benign but extreme cases of SIH can lead to changes in the level of consciousness. We describe a case in which alteration in the level of consciousness was prolonged and severe, and could not be explained solely by the presence of subdural collections. MRI of the brain showed evidence of impaired venous flow secondary to brain sagging causing distortion of deep venous structures.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: In this article, we review the effects of the respiratory pump to improve vital organ perfusion by the use of an inspiratory threshold device.

   DATA SOURCES: Medline and MeSH database.

   STUDY SELECTION: All papers with a level of proof of I to III have been used.

   DATA EXTRACTION: The analysis of the papers has focused on the physiological modifications induced by intrathoracic pressure regulation.

   DATA SYNTHESIS: Primary function of breathing is to provide gas exchange. Studies of the mechanisms involved in animals and humans provide the physiological underpinnings for "the other side of breathing": to increase circulation to the heart and brain. We describe studies that focus on the fundamental relationship between the generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration through a low-level of resistance created by an impedance threshold device and the physiologic effects of a respiratory pump. A decrease in intrathoracic pressure during inspiration through a fixed resistance resulting in an intrathoracic pressure of -7 cmH2O has multiple physiological benefits including: enhanced venous return, cardiac stroke volume and aortic blood pressure; lower intracranial pressure; resetting of the cardiac baroreflex; elevated cerebral blood flow oscillations and increased tissue blood flow/pressure gradient.

   CONCLUSION: The clinical and animal studies support the use of the intrathoracic pump to treat different clinical conditions: hemorrhagic shock, orthostatic hypotension, septic shock, and cardiac arrest.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is characterized by ventriculomegaly with persistent low intracranial pressure (ICP). Sub-zero drainage is needed for its management and multiple solutions have been described. Our aim is to report our experience with custom-made peritoneal catheters with larger inner diameter as an alternative treatment option.

   METHODS: We made a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with LPH and treated with custom-made peritoneal catheters at the Virgen del Rocio Pediatric Neurosurgical Unit. Catheters were coated with antibiotic or silver. The inner diameter of ventricular catheters was 1.4 mm; peritoneal catheters were larger than usual (1.9 mm inner diameter).

   RESULTS: We identified four patients in whom five custom-made peritoneal catheters were used over a 3-year period. There were two males and the mean age was 10 years (6 months-17 years). In all patients, placement of an EVD was necessary for sub-zero drainage, with maximum negative pressure of -8 cm H20. The mean time of maintenance of EVD was 102 days (10 days-1 year). Finally, three ventriculoperitoneal (VP) valveless systems, one with antigravitation device, and one Pro-GAV VP shunt were placed, all of them with larger custom-made peritoneal catheters. After a mean follow-up period of 2.3 years (6 months-3 years), two patients are completely recovered, one patient is partially dependent for daily activities with good cognitive status, and the last one is a child who died due to his brain tumor.

   CONCLUSION: The custom-made peritoneal catheters with larger inner diameter could be a good option for the management of this complex pathology.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Superior venous outflow obstruction affects cerebral perfusion negatively by reducing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). We present a randomized study designed to compare two alternative strategies to preserve the CPP during superior vena cava (SVC) congestion and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

   METHODS: Fourteen pigs on bi-caval CPB were subjected to 75% occlusion of the SVC flow. CPP was restored either by vasopressor treatment (VP, n = 7) or by partial relief (PR) of the congestion (n = 7). The cerebral effects of the interventions were studied for 60 min with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, cerebral blood flow measurement, the near-infrared light spectroscopy tissue oxygen saturation index (StO2), arterial and venous blood gas analyses and serial measurements of the glial cell damage marker protein S100beta.

   RESULTS: Both strategies restored the CPP to baseline levels and no signs of severe ischaemia were observed. In the PR group, the venous and ICPs were normalized in response to the intervention, while in the VP group those parameters remained elevated throughout the experiment. The haemoglobin oxygen saturation in the sagittal sinus (SsagO2) was increased by both VP and PR, while significant improvement in the StO2 was observed only in the PR group. The S100beta concentrations were similar in the two groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Experimental SVC obstruction during CPB may reduce the CPP, resulting in impaired cerebral perfusion. Both vasopressor treatment and improved venous drainage can, in the short term, individually restore the CPP during these circumstances.

Abstract
  OBJECT: The intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR) is a novel noninvasive device designed to increase circulation and blood pressure. By applying negative pressure during the expiratory phase of ventilation it decreases intrathoracic pressure and enhances venous return, which increases cardiac output. It is possible that the ITPR may both decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) and increase cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in brain-injured patients by decreasing cerebral venous blood volume and increasing cardiac output. The authors conducted an open-label, "first-in-humans" study of the ITPR in patients with an ICP monitor or external ventricular drain and altered intracranial elastance.

   METHODS: This prospective randomized trial commenced July 2009. Baseline hemodynamic variables and ICP were recorded prior to inserting one of the two ITPRs into the ventilator circuit based on a randomization scheme. Depending on the device selected, activation provided either -5 or -9 mm Hg endotracheal tube pressure. Hemodynamic and ICP data were recorded sequentially every 2 minutes for 10 minutes. The first device was turned off for 10 minutes, then it was removed and the second device was applied, and then the procedure was repeated for the second device.

   RESULTS: Ten patients with elevated ICP secondary to intracranial hemorrhage (n = 4), trauma (n = 2), obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 2), or diffuse cerebral processes (n = 2) were enrolled. Baseline ICP ranged from 12 to 38 mm Hg. With device application, a decrease in ICP was observed in 16 of 20 applications. During treatment with the -5 mm Hg device, there was a mean maximal decrease of 3.3 mm Hg in ICP (21.7 vs 18.4 mm Hg, p = 0.003), which was associated with an increase in CPP of 6.5 mm Hg (58.2 vs 64.7 mm Hg, p = 0.019). During treatment with the -9 mm Hg device, there was a mean maximal decrease of 2.4 mm Hg in ICP (21.1 vs 18.7 mm Hg, p = 0.044), which was associated with an increase in CPP of 6.5 mm Hg (59.2 vs 65.7 mm Hg, p = 0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that use of the ITPR in patients with altered intracranial elastance is feasible. Although this study was not powered to demonstrate efficacy, these data strongly suggest that the ITPR may be used to rapidly lower ICP and increase CPP without apparent adverse effects. Additional studies will be needed to assess longitudinal changes in ICP when the device is in use and to delineate treatment parameters.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the pressure setting of the ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt valve and a magnetic resonance (MR)-based estimate of intracranial pressure (ICP) in children with shunt-treated hydrocephalus without clinical signs of shunt malfunction.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained before the study, and all subjects and/or their legal guardians provided written informed consent. In this prospective study, 15 consecutive patients (median age, 8.25 years; range, 2.2-18.4 years; 6 girls and 9 boys) with shunt-treated hydrocephalus without signs of shunt malfunction were examined with retrospectively gated phase contrast sequences to quantify arterial inflow, venous outflow, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow to and from the cranial vault. The ratio of the maximal intracranial volume change and the pulse pressure gradient change was used to derive MR-ICP. Spearman rho was used to test for the association of setting of the shunt valve opening pressure and MR-ICP.

   RESULTS: Shunt valve opening pressure settings and MR-ICP were positively correlated (Spearman rho = 0.64, P < 0.01). Median MR-ICP was 8.67 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR], 1.59 mm Hg) and median setting of the VP-shunt valve was 6.62 mm Hg (IQR, 1.47 mm Hg). The median MR-ICP was 1.9 mm Hg (IQR, 0.73 mm Hg) higher than the setting of the shunt valve.

   CONCLUSION: There is a positive correlation between MR-ICP and VP shunt valve opening pressure setting. The systematically higher assessment of MR-ICP is most likely a result of outflow resistance within the shunt tubing system and well within the known fluctuation rates of VP shunt systems.

Abstract
  Primary stabbing headache (PSH) is a primary syndrome of unknown aetiology, characterised by brief, jabbing stabs predominantly felt in the orbital, temporal and parietal areas, whose frequency may vary from one to many per day, usually responding to indomethacin. PSH frequency in the general population is not well defined, but recent evidence suggests it could be more frequent than previously thought. In clinical series, PSH incidence was 33/100,000 per year, while in a population study 35.2 % prevalence was found. PSH was previously described as isolated or associated to other headache syndromes, most frequently with migraine. There is evidence that an idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema, a condition usually associated to significant stenosis of dural sinuses (93 % sensitivity and specificity), is much more prevalent than believed and may run asymptomatically in up to 11 % of otherwise healthy individuals. In migrainous prone people, a sinus stenosis-associated intracranial hypertension without papilledema (ss-IHWOP) comorbidity may represent a powerful risk factor for progression of pain. Besides migraine, significant sinus stenosis has been found overrepresented also in chronic tension type headache as well as in exertional, cough, sexual activity-associated headaches (all indomethacin responsive primary headaches) and in altitude headache (an acetazolamide responsive condition). To explore the possible association between venous outflow disturbances and PSH, we retrospectively investigated the co-occurrence of sinus venous stenosis in patients referring to our headache centre since 2004 diagnosed with PSH who completed the diagnostic protocol. Out of 50 consecutive patients reporting PSH as the main or as accessory complaint, 8 (6 females, 2 males) performed MR venography (MRV). All MRV revealed significant unilateral or bilateral sinus stenosis. Mean age at PSH onset was 35.3 +/- 18.9 years (range 11-67 years). Duration of attacks ranged 1-3 s. Median daily frequency of attacks was 4 (range 2-20); median number of days per month with PSH presentation was 14 (range 4-30). Six patients described attacks in temporal or parietal areas, one at the top of the head, and one in the occipital area. Only one patient had isolated PSH; all the others were diagnosed also with migraine without aura. Seven out of eight patients responded to indomethacin 75 mg/die, and one to topiramate 100 mg/die. Interestingly, both drugs share with acetazolamide a CSF pressure lowering effect. Our findings indicate that PSH is associated with central sinus stenosis and suggest that an undiagnosed ss-IHWOP might be involved in PSH pathogenesis.

Abstract
  We report a patient with intracranial hemorrhage secondary to venous hypertension as a result of a giant aortic pseudoaneurysm that compressed the superior vena cava and caused obstruction of the venous return from the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first patient reported to have an intracranial hemorrhage secondary to a superior vena cava syndrome. The condition appears to be caused by a reversible transient rise in intracranial pressure, as a result of compression of the venous return from the brain. Treatment consisted of surgery for the aortic pseudoaneurysm, which led to normalization of the intracranial pressure and resorption of the intracranial hemorrhage. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  Intensivists use neuromuscular blocking agents for a variety of clinical conditions, including for emergency intubation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, status asthmaticus, elevated intracranial pressure, elevated intra-abdominal pressure, and therapeutic hypothermia after ventricular fibrillation-associated cardiac arrest. The continued creation and use of evidence-based guidelines and protocols could ensure that neuromuscular blocking agents are used and monitored appropriately. A collaborative multidisciplinary approach coupled with constant review of the pharmacology, dosing, drug interactions, and monitoring techniques may reduce the adverse events associated with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents.

Abstract
  A 1-year-old female was admitted with a subcutaneous, pulsatile soft mass in the midline parietal region, and abnormal head shape. Fundus examination showed papilledema, suggesting elevated intracranial pressure. Radiological findings showed sagittal suture craniosynostosis with sinus pericranii. Magnetic resonance venography showed that the drainage through the sinus pericranii was not essential for the venous outflow from the brain. The patient underwent surgical resection of the sinus pericranii and total cranial remodeling. Ligation of the stalk-like orifice attached to the superior sagittal sinus with resection of the sinus pericranii and total cranial reconstruction were performed concurrently. The postoperative course was uneventful, and her papilledema resolved. No recurrence of the sinus pericranii has occurred for 3 years. This case describes a unique one-staged operation to treat sinus pericranii with sagittal suture craniosynostosis.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of isoflurane and sevoflurane on intracranial pressure and cardiovascular variables at 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 times the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) in mechanically ventilated normocapnic dogs.

   ANIMALS: 6 healthy male Beagles.

   PROCEDURES: The individual MAC was determined for each agent with an electrical stimulus. After a minimum of 1 week, anesthetic induction by use of a mask with one of the inhalation anesthetics selected randomly was followed by mechanical ventilation and instrumentation for measurement of intracranial pressure and cardiovascular variables. Heart rate; systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial blood pressures; central venous pressure; mean pulmonary arterial pressure; pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; cardiac output; intracranial pressure (ICP); core body temperature; end-tidal inhalation anesthetic and carbon dioxide concentration; and arterial blood gas values were measured after attaining equilibrium at 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 MAC of each inhalation anesthetic. Cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were calculated.

   RESULTS: Mean ICP did not differ within and between anesthetics at any MAC. Compared with equipotent concentrations of isoflurane, the CPP and mean values for systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial blood pressures were increased at 2.0 MAC for sevoflurane, whereas mean values for mean and diastolic arterial blood pressures and systemic vascular resistance were increased at 1.5 MAC for sevoflurane.

   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although ICP was similar in healthy normocapnic dogs, CPP was better maintained during 2.0 MAC for sevoflurane, compared with isoflurane.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: The extracranial venous drainage of the brain is provided mainly by the jugular veins with the variable participation of extrajugular pathways.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two cases of occipital sinus pericranii (SP) were observed. A 6-year-old girl presented with a progressively enlarging occipital lump; she was otherwise asymptomatic. An 8-year-old boy presented with mild nuchal headache. In the former case, neuroimaging examinations confirmed the diagnosis of SP; in the latter, SP was noticed on magnetic resonance imaging because it was neglected at physical examination. In both subjects, the radiological examination also showed bilateral occlusion of the jugular veins with ventricular dilation and herniation of cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum.

   CONCLUSION: Exceptionally, SP was noticed to represent the main venous drainage of the underlying brain, thereby compensating for the intracranial hypertension due to venous engorgement. Preservation of SP was advised, and any surgical or endovascular treatment was contraindicated.

Abstract
  Low-pressure hydrocephalus is a rare type of hydrocephalus characterized by negative intracranial pressure (ICP) and ventriculomegaly. Given the shortcomings of available methods to treat refractory low-pressure hydrocephalus, we set out to develop a new system for evacuation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricular system where existing shunt systems do not produce the necessary gradient for CSF drainage. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of two patients with the diagnosis of negative-pressure hydrocephalus refractory to traditional treatments. We combined a traditional low-pressure, non-siphoning valve with a pumping chamber placed distal to the valve to create a system that could be actively pumped to remove excess CSF. Treatment of negative-pressure hydrocephalus requires the establishment of a lower ventricular drainage pressure than the drainage pressure in the subarachnoid space. In refractory cases, we propose the use of this active negative-pressure pumping system. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Stenosis of central veins (brachiocephalic vein [BCV] and superior vena cava) occurs in 30% of hemodialysis patients, rarely producing intracranial pathology. The authors present the first cases of BCV stenosis causing perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage and myoclonic epilepsy. In the first case, a 73-year-old man on hemodialysis presented with headache and blurry vision, and was admitted with presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension after negative CT studies and confirmatory lumbar puncture. The patient mildly improved until hospital Day 3, when he experienced a seizure; emergency CT scans showed perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography failed to find any vascular abnormality, but demonstrated venous congestion. A fistulogram found left BCV occlusion with jugular reflux. The occlusion could not be reopened percutaneously and required open fistula ligation. Postoperatively, symptoms resolved and the patient remained intact at 7-month follow-up. In the second case, a 67-year-old woman on hemodialysis presented with right arm weakness and myoclonic jerks. Admission MRI revealed subcortical edema and a possible dural arteriovenous fistula. Cerebral angiography showed venous engorgement, but no vascular malformation. A fistulogram found left BCV stenosis with jugular reflux, which was immediately reversed with angioplasty and stent placement. Postprocedure the patient was seizure free, and her strength improved. Seven months later the patient presented in myoclonic status epilepticus, and a fistulogram revealed stent occlusion. Angioplasty successfully reopened the stent and she returned to baseline; she was seizure free at 4-month follow-up. Central venous stenosis is common with hemodialysis, but rarely presents with neurological findings. Prompt recognition and endovascular intervention can restore normal venous drainage and resolve symptoms.

Abstract
  OBJECT: The authors examined the role of venous sinus obstruction in the etiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) by reviewing more than 200 MR venograms performed in suspected cases of IIH.

   METHODS: Individual MR venograms performed in cases of suspected IIH at the Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney, Australia, were reviewed. The authors excluded cases in which an intervention was performed before the scan or a structural cause for venous obstruction was identified. Cases with confirmed hydrocephalus were also excluded. For each of the 145 remaining scans, the authors completed a detailed review on a slice-by-slice basis of the 2D source images used to compile the rendered 3D MR venogram. The anatomical configuration of the dural venous sinuses and any areas of decreased flow in circulation were then noted. Where possible, they correlated their radiological findings with evidence of raised intracranial pressure based on LP opening pressures. They also reviewed a control group of 50 MR venograms.

   RESULTS: Seventy-six (52%) of 145 scans showed evidence of venous obstruction in the dominant-side circulation. Substantial nonphysiological collateral circulation was seen in 68% of cases with dominant-sided obstruction, suggesting a process of recanalization. In contrast, in the absence of dominant-sided obstruction, collateral circulation was uncommon. In 27 cases, CSF opening pressure measurements were available. In 20 cases the opening pressures were in excess of 20 cm H(2)O. Of those, 17 demonstrated evidence of dominant-sided venous outflow obstruction. Among those cases, the median opening pressure was 34 cm H(2)O. Dominant-sided venous outflow obstruction was seen in only 2 of 50 MR venograms in the control group. Furthermore, evidence of collateral circulation was also uncommon in the control group. There was a highly statistically significant difference between rates of dominant-sided venous obstruction in the suspected IIH and control groups (p <= 0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients presenting for investigation of suspected IIH demonstrated evidence of dominant-sided venous obstruction on MR venogram. In addition there was a high correlation between elevated CSF opening pressures and dominant-sided venous sinus obstruction. This correlation was further supported by evidence of collateral recanalization in patients with elevated CSF pressures and dominant-sided venous obstruction. A control group of 50 MR venograms indicated that dominant-sided venous outflow obstruction is an unlikely incidental finding, and a highly statistically significant difference was found between rates of obstruction in the suspected IIH and control groups.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To explore and evaluate the efficacy of intrasinus thrombolysis (IST) in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) during postpartum period.

   METHODS: 11 patients during postpartum period with CVST who received IST during July 2007-November 2011 were included. Urokinase was infused into the sinuses via a microcatheter. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) was performed to assess the recanalization of venous sinuses.

   RESULTS: Before discharge, the intracranial pressure in 11 patients was under 200 mmH(2)O. MRV confirmed that venous sinus of 9 patients were smooth. The cortex venous and deep venous recovered to normal. Venous sinus of 2 patients recanalized partly, and cortex venous and deep venous had compensation. 9 patients had good outcome and 2 patients had only mild deficits.

   CONCLUSION: Intrasinus thrombolysis is safe and effective in patients with severe cerebral venous sinus thrombosis during postpartum period. Copyright © 2012. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cerebral venography and manometry are used for the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant venous sinus stenosis in patients with the syndrome of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Intravenous pressure measurements using the traditional microcatheter technique can be cumbersome, time consuming and potentially unreliable. The PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire conducts pressure electrically and can be used as a guidewire for intervention. It has been validated in interventional cardiology procedures.

   OBJECTIVE: We describe our initial clinical experience with the PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire system for cerebral venous manometry and intervention.

   METHOD: Cerebral venous pressure gradient was directly measured by advancing the pressure wire across a region of stenosis. The pressure wire was also used as a guidewire for intravascular ultrasound, angioplasty and stenting.

   RESULTS: The PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire successfully navigated the intracranial venous sinus anatomy. Transfer of devices over the guidewire in a monorail fashion was uncomplicated, and measurement of sinus pressure between the steps of the intervention was efficiently performed.

   CONCLUSION: The PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire system provided a safe, fast and effective method for intracranial venous sinus manometry and intervention. It has several potential advantages over the traditional microcatheter method, including efficiency, accuracy and cost.

Abstract
  Surgical treatment of functional single-ventricle heart disease with a modified Fontan procedure results in elevated central venous pressure. The case report describes a 19-year-old boy with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and Fontan palliation that resulted in frequent debilitating headaches after transcatheter closure of systemic venous-to-pulmonary venous collaterals. Measured increased intracranial pressure and prompt relief of the headaches with lumbar puncture favored a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri. After implantation of a lumboperitoneal shunt, the patient's headaches improved dramatically. Headaches are frequent in patients with Fontan circulation. The current literature supports a pivotal role of elevated dural venous sinus pressure in the pathogenesis of pseudotumor cerebri. The high superior and inferior vena caval pressures characteristic of modified Fontan anatomy may account for headaches in some of these patients.

Abstract
  A 39-year-old white man presented with intractable headaches and papilledema. The initial workup, with normal MRI and MRV but elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein raised concerns about the putative diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and his condition remained refractory to maximum medical treatment. Angiography revealed cerebral venous sinus stenosis, thought to represent chronic thrombosis. The diagnosis and treatment of cerebral venous sinus stenosis and thrombosis are discussed.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) and optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) are accepted surgical therapies for medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). In the subset of patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis, dural venous sinus stenting has emerged as an alternative surgical approach.

   METHODS: All cases of dural stents for IIH at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Eligibility criteria included medically refractory IIH with documented papilledema and dural venous sinus stenosis of the dominant venous outflow system (gradient >=10 mm Hg).

   RESULTS: Fifteen cases (all women) of mean age 34 years were identified. All had failed medical therapy and six had failed surgical intervention. Technical success was achieved in all patients without major periprocedural complications. The mean preprocedural gradient across the venous stenosis was reduced from 24 mm Hg before the procedure to 4 mm Hg after the procedure. Headache resolved or improved in 10 patients. Papilledema resolved in all patients and visual acuity stabilized or improved in 14 patients. There were no instances of restenosis among the 14 patients with follow-up imaging.

   CONCLUSION: In this small case series, dural sinus stenting for IIH was performed safely with a high degree of technical success and with excellent clinical outcomes. These results suggest that angioplasty and stenting for the treatment of medically refractory IIH in patients with dural sinus stenosis warrants further investigation as an alternative to LPS, VPS and ONSF.

Abstract
  Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are abnormal communications between arteries and veins or dural venous sinuses, which sit between the sheets of the dura. They represent 10% to 15% of intracranial vascular malformations. Clinical manifestations and prognosis depend on the pattern of venous drainage and location. The clinical presentation of DAVF may be mistaken for vascular or nonvascular brain pathologies. For that reason, within the differential diagnosis come a wide range of conditions, such as secondary headaches, encephalopathies, dementias including those with rapid progression, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory processes, or tumors typically at the orbital level or in the cavernous sinus. Diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion because of the multiplicity of symptoms and presentations, making this pathology an entity that provides a major challenge for clinicians, yet early and multidisciplinary treatment of high-grade fistulas improve the possibility of avoiding poor or unfavorable outcomes for the patient.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Acute lower extremity compartment syndrome (CS) is a condition that untreated causes irreversible nerve and muscle ischemia. Treatment by decompression fasciotomy without delay prevents permanent disability. The use of intracompartmental pressure (iCP) measurement in uncertain situations aids in diagnosis of severe leg pain. As an infrequent complication of lower extremity trauma, consequences of CS include chronic pain, nerve injury, and contractures. The purpose of this study was to observe the clinical and functional outcomes for patients with lower extremity CS after fasciotomy.

   METHODS: Retrospective chart analysis for patients with a discharge diagnosis of CS was performed. Physical demographics, employment status, activity at time of injury, injury severity score, fracture types, pain scores, hours to fasciotomy, iCP, serum creatine kinase levels, wound treatment regimen, length of hospital stay, and discharge facility were collected. Lower extremity neurologic examination, pain scores, orthopedic complications, and employment status at 30 days and 12 months after discharge were noted.

   RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients were enrolled in this study. One hundred and eight patients were assessed at 12 months. Eighty-one percent were male. Motorized vehicles caused 51% of injuries in males. Forty-one percent of injuries were tibia fractures. Acute kidney injury occurred in 2.4%. Mean peak serum creatine kinase levels were 58,600 units/ml. Gauze dressing was used in 78.9% of nonfracture patients and negative pressure wound vacuum therapy in 78.2% of fracture patients. About 21.6% of patients with CS had prior surgery. Nearly 12.9% of patients required leg amputation. Around 81.8% of amputees were male. Sixty-seven percent of amputees had associated vascular injuries. Foot numbness occurred in 20.5% of patients and drop foot palsy in 18.2%. Osteomyelitis developed in 10.2% of patients and fracture nonunion in 6.8%. About 14.7% of patients underwent further orthopedic surgery. At long-term follow-up, 10.2% of patients reported moderate lower extremity pain and 69.2% had returned to work.

   CONCLUSION: Escalation in leg pain and changes in sensation are the cardinal signs for CS rather than reliance on assessing for firm compartments and pressures. The severity of nerve injury worsens with the delay in performing fasciotomy. Standardized diagnostic protocols and wound treatment strategies will result in improved outcomes from this complication.

Abstract
  Intracranial hypertension and papilloedema are known to develop secondary to cerebral sinus or bilateral jugular vein thrombosis. However, in rare cases, unilateral jugular vein thrombosis may lead to increased intracranial pressure and papilloedema with resultant headache and vision changes. We describe a 45-year-old patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx that developed right jugular vein thrombosis after chemoradiation therapy with cetuximab. This was later complicated by intracranial hypertension and papilloedema. The normal cerebral venous drainage, the potential role of chemoradiation therapy on the aetiology of jugular vein thrombosis, and the mechanism of increased intracranial pressure secondary to unilateral jugular vein occlusion are discussed.

Abstract
  Intracranial hypertension is a syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure that can be primary or secondary. The primary form, now termed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), was in the past a disease of exclusion and imaging played a limited role of excluding organic causes of raised intracranial pressure. However imaging markers have been described with patients with IIH at the orbit, sella and cerebral venous system. We wish to reiterate the characteristic imaging features of this poorly understood disease and also emphasise that stenting of the transverse sinus in select cases of IIH is an efficacious option.

Abstract
  Spontaneous intracranial hypotension, of which brain slump is an extreme expression, is caused by a cerebrospinal fluid leak. The reason the leak develops in the first place, however, is unknown, and some cases can be very difficult to manage. We describe a patient with severe symptoms of spontaneous intracranial hypotension and brain slump documented by magnetic resonance imaging whose clinical syndrome and structural brain anomaly resolved completely after treatment directed exclusively at improving cranial venous outflow. Diagnostics included computed tomography (CT) venography, catheter venography, and jugular venoplasty. CT venography showed narrowing of both internal jugular veins below the skull base. Catheter venography confirmed that these were associated with pressure gradients. Jugular venoplasty performed on two separate occasions as a clinical test gave temporary respite. Lasting remission (2 years of follow-up) was achieved by stenting the dominant internal jugular vein. These findings and this outcome suggest a mechanism for the development of spontaneous intracranial hypotension that would link it to idiopathic intracranial hypertension and have cranial venous outflow obstruction as the underlying cause.

Abstract
  OBJECT Decompressive craniectomy (DC) for the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is controversial. The authors sought to determine if DC improves the outcome of children with severe TBI. METHODS In a retrospective, case-control study, medical records of all patients admitted to the pediatric ICU between May 1998 and May 2008 with severe TBI and treated with DC were identified and matched to patients who were treated medically without DC. Medical records were reviewed for patients' demographic data and baseline characteristics. RESULTS During the study period, 17 patients with severe TBI treated with DC at a median of 2 hours (interquartile range [IQR] 1-14 hours) after admission were identified and matched to 17 contemporary controls. On admission, there were no differences between DC and control patients regarding age (10.2 +/- 5.9 years vs 12.4 +/- 5.4 years, respectively [mean +/- SD]), sex, weight, Glasgow Coma Scale score (median 5 [IQR 3-7] vs 4 [IQR 3-6], respectively; p = 0.14), or the highest intracranial pressure (median 42 [IQR 22-54] vs 30 [IQR 21-36], respectively; p = 0.77). However, CT findings were significant for a higher rate of herniation and cerebral edema among patients with DC versus controls (7/17 vs 2/17, respectively, had herniation [p = 0.05] and 14/17 vs 6/17, respectively, had cerebral edema [p = 0.006]). Overall there were no significant differences in survival between patients with DC and controls (71% [12/17] vs 82% [14/17], respectively; p = 0.34). However, among survivors, at 4 years (IQR 1-6 years) after the TBI, 42% (5/12) of the DC patients had mild disability or a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 5 vs none (0/14) of the controls (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS In this retrospective, small case-control study, the authors have shown that early DC in pediatric patients with severe TBI improves outcome in survivors. Future prospective randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Osmotherapy is the frequently used for the treatment of intracranial pressure. The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of equiosmolar solution of 3% hypertonic saline and 20% mannitol on brain relaxation in supratentorial tumor surgery.

   METHODS: After institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 50 patients aged >18, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) >13 with ASA physical status 1, 2, and 3 scheduled to undergo craniotomy for supratentorial tumors were enrolled in this prospective, randomized study. Patients received 5 ml/kg of either 3% hypertonic saline (n = 25) or 20% mannitol (n = 25). Hemodynamic variables (heart rate [HR], SBP, DBP, MBP, and central venous pressure [CVP]), serum electrolytes, serum osmolality, urine output, and fluid balance were measured. The surgeon assessed the brain condition on four point scale (1 = perfectly relaxed, 2 = satisfactorily relaxed, 3 = firm brain, and 4 = bulging brain), who was blinded to study drug.

   RESULTS: Brain relaxation was comparable in two groups and there was no significant difference (P = 0.633). The number of brain conditions classified as perfectly relaxed, satisfactorily relaxed, firm brain, and bulging brain in the HS group was 8, 13, 3, and 1, respectively, whereas it was 5, 17, 3, and 0, respectively, in the M group. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic variables between the two groups except CVP at 30 min (P = 048). Compared with mannitol, hypertonic saline caused increase in the serum osmolality at 120 min (P = 0.008) and in serum sodium at 120 min (P = 0.001). Urine output was higher with mannitol than hypertonic saline (P = 0.001).

   CONCLUSION: 3% hypertonic saline and 20% mannitol are equally effective for brain relaxation in elective supratentorial tumor surgery and compared with mannitol, hypertonic saline was associated with less diuretic effect.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: We present a rare case of tension pneumocephalus (TP) after head trauma not involving mask ventilation but based on pathological respiration pattern, kussmaul breathing. TP is rare condition and exceptionally rare when positive airway pressure has not been applied. In this particular case, the vacuum and one-valve intracranial effects causing pneumocephalon were instead accentuated by a pathological pattern of respiration due to severe ketoacidosis - a condition not previously reported in the literature.

   METHODS: This is a case report showing a rare cause of pneumocephalon caused by patients own respiration. We retrospectively reviewed the patients' journal to find the cause of his severe pneumocephalon. The patient has not been ventilated and the only cause of TP in this case seems to be his own rapid and pathological breathing caused by ketoacidosis.

   CONCLUSION: In the presented case, pathologic deep and rapid respiration exerted additional pressure on the dural fistula allowing ambient air at a pressure above ICP to drive itself into the intracranial space. The loss of CSF from skull base fractures created a void space and relative negative pressure, allowing air to bubble in and fill the void. Copyright © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Abstract
  Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) is a rare phenomenon that can be seen with some frequency in young patients. CSVT is a multifactorial condition with gender-related specific causes, with a wide clinical presentation, the leading causes differ between developed and developing countries, converting CSVT in a condition characterized by a highly variable clinical spectra, difficult diagnosis, variable etiologies and prognosis that requires fine medical skills and a high suspicious index. Patients who presents with CSVT should underwent to CT-scan venography (CVT) and to the proper inquiry of the generating cause. This disease can affect the cerebral venous drainage and related anatomical structure. The symptoms may appear in relation to increased intracranial pressure imitating a pseudotumorcerebri. Prognosis depends on the early detection. Correcting the cause, generally the complications can be prevented. Mortality trends have diminished, and with the new technologies, surely it will continue. This work aims to review current knowledge about CSVT including its pathogenesis, etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral venous flow obstruction (CVFO) is a fatal complication of traumatic brain injury. To compare the outcomes of patients with CVFO secondary to traumatic-brain-injury-induced transsinus fracture who were diagnosed early versus those diagnosed late in the therapeutic course.

   METHODS: In total, 403 patients with transsinus fracture were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were divided into an early-diagnosis group (n=338) and a delayed-diagnosis group (n=65). The patients submitted to 2D time-of-flight magnetic resonance venography (2D-TOF MRV) and/or CT venography (CTV), depending upon the findings of intracranial pressure monitoring, in order to identify potentially complicated CVFO. These examinations took place within 3 days of the onset of malignant intracranial hypertension symptoms in the early-diagnosis group, and after an average of 7 days in the delayed-diagnosis group. Once diagnosed, patients received intravenous thrombolytic therapy with low-dose urokinase. Patients with massive transsinus epidural hematoma, depressed fracture, or cerebral hernia were treated surgically to relieve the compression and repair any damage to the venous sinuses.

   RESULTS: Cerebral venous flow obstruction was much more severe in the delayed-diagnosis group than in the early-diagnosis group (p<0.001), and hence patients in the former group were given a higher dose of urokinase (p<0.001) for thrombolytic therapy. They were also significantly more likely to need surgery (48.1% vs. 20.6%, p=0.003) and had a higher mortality rate (37.0% vs. 4.1%, p<0.001). However, patients in both groups experienced a similarly favorable prognosis, not only with regard to functional outcome but also with respect to neuroradiological improvement, as evaluated by 2D-TOF MRV/CTV at the final follow-up (p=0.218).

   CONCLUSIONS: Delayed diagnosis can result in increased risk of surgery and death in the acute phase. Thrombolytic therapy with low-dose urokinase resulted in promising improvements in both functional and neuroradiological outcomes in all of the patients in this study, regardless of the time to diagnosis.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) can cause elevated intracranial pressure, hemorrhagic venous infarct, and cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage. We present a case series and literature review to illustrate that CVST can also present with subdural hematoma (SDH).

   CASE DESCRIPTION: Chart review was completed on a retrospective case series of CVST with spontaneous SDH. We also conducted a literature search. Over a 6 year interval, three patients with CVST and SDH were admitted to the neurointensive care unit. A 38-year-old woman had both SDH and a hemorrhagic venous infarct associated with a transverse sinus thrombosis. She was managed conservatively with long-term anticoagulation. A 68-year-old woman presented with an acute SDH requiring craniotomy and a thrombosed cortical vein was noted intraoperatively. Computed tomography venography showed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. She had polycythemia vera with the V617 Jak2 gene mutation and was managed with aspirin and hydroxyurea. A 60-year-old male had recurrence of a spontaneous convexity SDH requiring reoperation. Neuroimaging identified ipsilateral transverse sinus thrombosis with retrograde flow into the opposite sinus. Manometry demonstrated elevated venous pressures and these normalized after thrombectomy. Angiography performed after endovascular treatment demonstrated a normal venous drainage pattern. There have been limited reports of SDH complicating CVST in the literature.

   CONCLUSION: This case series and literature review demonstrates that CVST can also present with spontaneous SDH with or without associated venous infarctions. Treatment must be individualized. This is the first published description of endovascular thrombectomy for recurrent symptomatic SDH due to CVST.

Abstract
  Physiologic and developmental role of mastoid pneumatisation in children with otitis media with effusion (OME) is still controversial. For measuring mastoid pneumatisation and examine developmental characteristics, we used children with orofacial malformation of high risk for long term negative pressure in the middle ear and are expected to have lower rate of size and growth of pneumatisation. Mastoid were measured on Schuller's mastoid X-ray pictures planimetrically in study group of 146 children with bilateral (BCLP), unilateral (UCLP) and isolated (ICP) cleft palate, and control group of non-cleft 52 children, both groups with confirmed otitis media with effusion and no previous otological surgery. The lowest pneumatisation found in BCLE, BCLP and UCLP showed no growth of mastoid with age and lower mastoid size than OME controls. ICP is the only cleft type with growth of mastoid with aging. OME patients has the highest size of mastoid and growth rate with aging.

Abstract
  A 69-year-old woman presented with a rare case of multiple supra- and infratentorial intracranial hemorrhages after cervical laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy without intraoperative liquorrhea. A wound drainage tube under negative pressure was placed with subsequent 380 ml of drainage in the first 12 hours. She had no complaint of headache and nausea at that time. Computed tomography of the brain obtained at 15 hours after surgery demonstrated cerebellar hemorrhage, acute subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, supratentorial intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and pneumocephalus. She was treated medically without consequent neurological deficits other than right hemianopsia. Overdrainage of cerebrospinal fluid through an occult dural tear might cause severely low intracranial pressure with subsequent multiple intracranial hemorrhages. Wound drainage should be controlled thoroughly even in patients without intraoperative liquorrhea.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) remains a poorly understood and therapeutically challenging disease. Enthusiasm has emerged for endovascular therapy with stent reconstruction of dural sinus narrowing; however, a complete understanding of the hydrodynamic dysequilibrium is lacking.

   OBJECTIVE: To review and characterize catheter manometry findings including pulsatility changes within the venous sinuses in IIH.

   METHODS: Cases of venous sinus stent implantation for IIH were retrospectively reviewed.

   RESULTS: Three cases of venous sinus stent implantation for treatment of IIH are reported. All cases demonstrated severe narrowing (>70%) within the transverse sinus and a high pressure gradient across the lesion (>30 mm Hg). Stent implantation resulted in pulsatility attenuation, correction of pressure gradient, and improvement of flow.

   CONCLUSION: We report the finding of high venous sinus pulsatility attenuation after stent implantation for dural sinus narrowing and propose the hypothesis that this finding is a marker of advanced dural sinus incompetence. This characteristic may be useful in identifying patients who would benefit from endovascular stent remodeling.

Abstract
  The pathogenesis and treatment paradigm for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are controversial. Transverse sinus stenosis is seen in the majority of patients with IIH and appears to play a role in the disease process. The debate continues as to whether transverse sinus stenosis is a primary or secondary process relative to raised intracranial pressure. While the role of transverse sinus stenosis in IIH pathogenesis remains controversial, modeling studies suggest that stent placement within a transverse sinus stenosis with a significant pressure gradient should decrease cerebral venous pressure, improve CSF resorption in the venous system, and thereby reduce intracranial (CSF) pressure, improving the symptoms of IIH and reducing papilledema. Beside the classical surgical treatments, venous sinus stenting could be a treatment option for many patients with IIH. However, additional work, preferably controlled prospective studies, needs to be performed to prove its safety and efficacy. The goal of this article is to review the current literature on dural venous sinus stenting. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  CLINICAL/METHODICAL ISSUE: The intracranial pressure (ICP) is a crucially important parameter for diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making in patients with hydrocephalus.

   STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: So far there is no standard method to non-invasively assess the ICP. Various approaches to obtain the ICP semi-invasively or non-invasively are discussed and the clinical application of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method to estimate ICP (MR-ICP) is demonstrated in a group of pediatric patients with hydrocephalus.

   METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: Arterial inflow, venous drainage and craniospinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow were quantified using phase-contrast imaging to derive the MR-ICP.

   PERFORMANCE: A total of 15 patients with hydrocephalus (n=9 treated with shunt placement or ventriculostomy) underwent MRI on a 3 T scanner applying retrospectively-gated cine phase contrast sequences. Of the patients six had clinical symptoms indicating increased ICP (age 2.5-14.61 years, mean 7.4 years) and nine patients had no clinical signs of elevated ICP (age 2.1-15.9 years; mean 9.8 years; all treated with shunt or ventriculostomy). Median MR-ICP in symptomatic patients was 24.5 mmHg (25th percentile 20.4 mmHg; 75th percentile 44.6 mmHg). Median MR-ICP in patients without acute signs of increased ICP was 9.8 mmHg (25th percentile 8.6 mmHg; 75th percentile 11.4 mmHg). Group differences were significant (p < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U-test).

   ACHIEVEMENTS: The MR-ICP technique is a promising non-invasive tool for estimating ICP.

   PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Further studies in larger patient cohorts are warranted to investigate its application in children with hydrocephalus.

Abstract
  The protocols for clinical evaluation and management of children with complex craniosynostoses are significantly different from those used in single suture forms. The time at which the various anatomical and functional anomalies observed in the affected subjects become clinically relevant varies from patient to patient, consequently requiring a tailored approach. The clinical course is variable and influenced by multiple factors, acting at different steps of the children growth. Intracranial hypertension is a major concern already in the first months of life; active cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics disorders, venous hypertension, and progressive craniocerebral disproportion are considered the main pathogenetic factors. Cranial vault and skull base sutures synostoses account for the frequently observed increased venous pressure. Skull base abnormalities lead to upper airways obstruction, which, on one side, might create significant upper airways obstructive problems and, on the other, contribute to the increase in the intracranial pressure. Secondary Chiari malformation is common and considered as a progressive disorder, mainly due to progressive craniocerebral disproportion, venous hypertension, and CSF dynamics disorders. Optic nerve and orbit-related eye-globe diseases are also a major concern. Papilledema is mostly related to increased intracranial pressure. The skull base synostotic process is the base of significant abnormalities of the orbital space, ending in the common feature of significant proptosis with the consequent risk of corneal ulcers. Aims of this paper are to analyze the physiopathogenetic mechanisms at the base of the clinical manifestations presented by children with complex craniosynostoses, and the therapeutic options currently available.

Abstract
  STUDY DESIGN: In vivo large animal (pig) model study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures after acute experimental spinal cord injury (SCI).

   OBJECTIVE: To determine how the CSF pressure (CSFP) and CSF pulse pressure amplitude (CSFPPA) cranial and caudal to the injury site change after an acute SCI with subsequent thecal occlusion and decompression.

   SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lowering intrathecal pressure via CSF drainage is currently instituted to prevent ischemia-induced SCI during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery and was recently investigated as a potential intervention for acute traumatic SCI. However, in SCI patients, persistent extradural compression commonly occludes the subarachnoid space. This may generate a CSFP differential across the injury site, which cannot be appreciated with lumbar catheter pressure measurements.

   METHODS: Anesthetized pigs were subjected to an acute contusive SCI at T11 and 8 hours of sustained compression (n = 12), or sham surgery (n = 2). CSFP was measured cranial and caudal to the injury site, using miniature pressure transducers, during compression and for 6 hours after decompression.

   RESULTS: The cranial-caudal CSFP differential increased (mean, 0.39 mm Hg/h), predominantly due to increased cranial pressure. On decompression, cranial CSFP decreased (mean, -1.16 mm Hg) and caudal CSFP increased (mean, 0.65 mm Hg). The CSFP differential did not change significantly after decompression. Cranial CSFPPA was greater than caudal CSFPPA, but this differential did not change during compression. On decompression, the caudal CSFPPA increased in some but not all animals.

   CONCLUSION: Although extradural compression exists at the site of injury, lumbar CSFP may not accurately indicate CSFP cranial to the injury. Decompression may provide immediate, though perhaps partial, resolution of the pressure differential. CSFPPA was not a consistent indicator of decompression in this animal model. These findings may have implications for the design of future clinical protocols in which CSFP is monitored after acute SCI.

Abstract
  A suction-free interfacing method was developed for microchip electrophoresis hyphenated with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MCE-ICP-MS). The hyphenated system was composed of a microchip, a demountable capillary microflow nebulizer (d-CMN) combined with a heated single pass spray chamber, a negative pressure sampling device, a high voltage power supply, a syringe pump and an ICP-MS. To eliminate the nebulizer suction generated by the pneumatic nebulizer and to ensure that the makeup solution flowed into the nebulizer, two porous polymer plugs were fabricated in the microchip. As a result, reasonably true electropherograms were obtained when compared to the CE separation performed in the traditional MCE-ICP-MS mode without porous polymer plugs. Electrophoretic separation of I(-) and IO(3)(-) was achieved within 25 s in a microchip with an effective separation length of only 15 mm at an electric field of 857 V cm(-1) using 10 mmol L(-1) borate (pH 9.2) as the running buffer. A resolution of 1.3 was obtained and the absolute detection limits for I(-) and IO(3)(-) were 0.12 and 0.13 fg, respectively. The precisions (RSD, n = 10) of the migration time and peak height for I(-) and IO(3)(-) were in the range of 1.1-1.6% and 2.5-2.8%, respectively. Two table salt samples were analyzed by an external calibration method. The iodate contents were in accordance with their labeled values. The recoveries of I(-) and IO(3)(-) in the table salt samples were in the range of 92-105%.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during the decompression phase of cardiopulmonary resuscitation enhances the refilling of the heart. We tested the hypothesis that when compared with closed-chest manual compressions at 80 chest compressions per min, treatment with active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation at 80 chest compressions/min combined with augmentation of negative intrathoracic pressure would lower intracranial pressure and increase cerebral perfusion, thereby improving neurologically intact survival rates following prolonged untreated cardiac arrest.

   DESIGN: Prospective, randomized animal study.

   SETTING: Animal laboratory facilities.

   SUBJECTS: A total of 26 female farm pigs in two different protocols (n = 17 and n = 9).

   INTERVENTIONS, MEASUREMENTS, AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen pigs were subjected to 8.5 mins of untreated ventricular fibrillation and prospectively randomized to cardiopulmonary resuscitation at 80 chest compressions/min or active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation at 80 chest compressions/min plus an impedance threshold device. Coronary perfusion pressures (29.5 +/- 2.7 mm Hg vs. 22.4 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p = .03), carotid blood flow (44.0 +/- 12.2 vs. 30.9 +/- 10.4, p = .03), and 24-hr neurological survival (88% vs. 22%, p = .015) were higher with active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation + an impedance threshold device. Cerebral perfusion pressures, measured in nine additional pigs, were improved with active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation + an impedance threshold device (21.9 +/- 1.2 mm Hg vs. 8.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, p < .0001). With active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation + impedance threshold device, mean diastolic intracranial pressure during decompression was lower (12.2 +/- 0.2 mm Hg vs. 16.6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, p = .02) and the downward slope of the decompression phase intracranial pressure curve was steeper (-60.3 +/- 12.9 mm Hg vs. -46.7 +/- 11.1 mm Hg/sec, p < .001).

   CONCLUSIONS: Active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation + an impedance threshold device increased cerebral perfusion pressures and lowered diastolic intracranial pressure and intracranial pressure rate during the decompression phase. These mechanisms may underlie the observed increase in cerebral perfusion pressure, carotid blood flow, and survival rates with favorable neurologic outcomes in this pig model of cardiac arrest.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To establish an animal model to replicate the blunt impact brain injury in forensic medicine.

   METHODS: Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into control group (n equal to 4), minor injury group (n equal to 10) and severe injury group (n equal to 10). Based on the BIM-II Horizontal Bio-impact Machine, self-designed iron bar was used to produce blunt brain injury. Two rabbits from each injury group were randomly selected to monitor the change of intracranial pressure (ICP) during the impacting process by pressure microsensors. Six hours after injury, all the rabbits were dissected to observe the injury morphology and underwent routine pathological examination.

   RESULTS: Varying degrees of nervous system positive signs were observed in all the injured rabbits. Within 6 hours, the mortality rate was 1/10 in the minor injury group and 6/10 in the severe injury group. Morphological changes consisted of different levels of scalp hematoma, skull fracture, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemo- rrhage and brain injury. At the moment of hitting, the ICP was greater in severe injury group than in mild injury group; and within the same group, the impact side showed positive pressure while the opposite side showed negative pressure.

   CONCLUSIONS: Under the rigidly-controlled experimental condition, this animal model has a good reproducibility and stable results. Meanwhile, it is able to simulate the morphology of iron strike-induced injury, thus can be used to study the mechanism of blunt head injury in forensic medicine.

Abstract
  Data from two recent studies strongly support the hypothesis that idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema (IIHWOP) could represent a powerful risk factor for the progression of pain in primary headache individuals. The first study highlights that an asymptomatic IIHWOP is much more prevalent than believed in the general population and occurs only in central venous stenosis carriers. In the second study, about one half of a large consecutive series of unresponsive primary chronic headache patients shows significant sinus venous stenosis. A continuous or intermittent IIHWOP was detectable in 91% of this subgroup and in no patient with normal venography. Moreover, after the lumbar puncture, a 2- to 4-week improvement in headache frequency was observed in most of the intracranial hypertensive patients. These findings strongly suggest that patients prone to primary headache who carry central venous outflow abnormalities are at high risk of developing a comorbid IIHWOP, which in turn is responsible for the progression and the unresponsiveness of the pain. Based on the available literature data, we propose that central sinus stenosis-related IIHWOP, although highly prevalent among otherwise healthy people, represents an important modifiable risk factor for the progression and refractoriness of pain in patients predisposed to primary headache. The mechanism could refer to up to one half of the primary chronic headache patients with minimal response to treatments referring to specialized headache clinics. Due to the clinical and taxonomic relevance of this hypothesis further studies are urgently needed.

Abstract
  Hydrocephalus in patients with achondroplasia is thought to be due to increased dural sinus venous pressure resulting from narrowing of the jugular foramen. In this setting, where hydrocephalus is presumed to be "vascular" in origin and therefore communicating, endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) would seem contraindicated. The authors describe 3 patients in whom ETV was successfully performed, resulting in MR imaging-documented decreases in ventricle size. The patients were 11 months, 33 months, and 13 years at the time of surgery. All patients had serial preoperative MR images demonstrating progressive hydrocephalus in a "triventricular" pattern with a small fourth ventricle but an open aqueduct. All patients had undergone suboccipital decompression for foramen magnum stenosis prior to the treatment of hydrocephalus. Preoperative retrograde venography revealed variable pressure gradients across the jugular foramen. It is postulated that the increase in intracranial venous pressure resulting from jugular foramen stenosis may lead to disproportionate venous engorgement of the cerebellum and some degree of obstructive hydrocephalus amenable to ETV. The authors discuss the role of suboccipital decompression in the progression of hydrocephalus in patients with achondroplasia.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Jugular foramen lesions are often associated with pathology of adjacent structures due to either compression or direct invasion. Common presenting symptoms include pulsatile tinnitus, a neck mass, hearing loss, and cranial nerve palsies, leading to changes in taste, vocal cord paralysis, dysphagia, and sternocleidomastoid/trapezius weakness (A. Hakuba, K. Hashi, K. Fujitani, et al., Jugular foramen neurinomas. Surg Neurol 1979; 11:83-94). This patient was found to have a jugular foramen mass after presenting with the unusual constellation of visual changes and headache.

   CASE PRESENTATION: A jugular foramen mass in a young woman was discovered after presenting with visual changes and headache; the patient was found to have papilledema on initial examination. Otologic and head and neck examination were normal. Subsequent imaging demonstrated a mass at the right jugular foramen with compression of this structure; a contralateral transverse sinus stenosis was also seen. This latter abnormality (along with obstruction of the jugular foramen) impeded venous drainage leading to papilledema and visual changes.

   DISCUSSION: In a patient presenting with papilledema and severe headache with an associated jugular foramen mass, a multidisciplinary approach benefits the patient with input from interventional neuroradiology, neurosurgery, and neuro-ophthalmology. Venous outflow was compromised through the left stenotic transverse sinus, and the normal outflow on the right side through the jugular bulb was impeded by the tumor; obstructions of both led to symptomatic impeded venous outflow. This compromise in venous outflow led to an increase in superior sagittal sinus pressure, with subsequent increase in intracranial pressure and resultant papilledema. In an attempt to increase blood flow, an angioplasty was performed on the patient's affected transverse sinus. In addition, symptomatology consistent with pseudotumor cerebri prompted the use of acetazolamide for medical management. After both therapies, the patient's symptoms dramatically improved and were stable. The tumor has also remained stable, with no immediate need for surgical resection, stereotactic radiation, or consideration of an intraluminal transverse sinus stent placement or shunting.

   CONCLUSION: The unique presentation of a jugular foramen mass in a young woman leading to papilledema highlights the need for high clinical suspicion of potential etiologies necessary for diagnosis. Despite the benign nature of her disease process, an unusual constellation of anatomical factors lead to the need for acute intervention. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECT: The use of unilateral dural sinus stent placement in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has been described by multiple investigators. To date there is a paucity of information on the angiographic and hemodynamic outcome of these procedures. The object of this study was to define the clinical, angiographic, and hemodynamic outcome of placement of unilateral dural sinus stents to treat intracranial venous hypertension in a subgroup of patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for IIH.

   METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of IIH were treated with unilateral stent placement in the transverse-sigmoid junction region. All patients had papilledema. All 12 female patients had headaches; 1 of 6 males had headaches previously that disappeared after weight loss. Seventeen patients had elevated opening pressures at lumbar puncture. Twelve patients had opening pressures of 33-55 cm H(2)O. All patients underwent diagnostic cerebral arteriography that showed venous outflow compromise by filling defects in the transverse-sigmoid junction region. All patients underwent intracranial selective venous pressure measurements across the filling defects. Follow-up arteriography was performed in 16 patients and follow-up venography/venous pressure measurements were performed in 15 patients.

   RESULTS: Initial pressure gradients across the filling defects ranged from 10.5 to 39 mm Hg. Nineteen stent procedures were performed in 18 patients. One patient underwent repeat stent placement for hemodynamic failure. Pressure gradients were reduced in every instance and ranged from 0 to 7 mm Hg after stenting. Fifteen of 16 patients in whom ophthalmological follow-up was performed experienced disappearance of papilledema. Follow-up arteriography in 16 patients at 5-99 months (mean 25.3 months, median 18.5 months) showed patency of all stents without in-stent restenosis. Two patients had filling defects immediately above the stent. Four other patients developed transverse sinus narrowing above the stent without filling defects. One of these patients underwent repeat stent placement because of hemodynamic deterioration. Two of the other 3 patients had hemodynamic deterioration with recurrent pressure gradients of 10.5 and 18 mm Hg.

   CONCLUSIONS: All stents remained patent without restenosis. Stent placement is durable and successfully eliminates papilledema in appropriately selected patients. Continuing hemodynamic success in this series was 80%, and was 87% with repeat stent placement in 1 patient.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) has detrimental effects on organ function and is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. IAH has also been shown to increase intracranial pressure. The exact mechanism is not known. This study tests the effect of an acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mice.

   METHODS: Male CD-1 mice weighing 30 g to 38 g were used. Mice in experimental groups underwent either 4 hours of IAH or 4 hours of IAH followed by 1 hour of decompression (DC). A set of control mice were anesthetized for either 4 hours or 5 hours. Femoral artery cannulation was used for blood pressure monitoring. IAH was induced by intraperitoneal infusion of mineral oil to a pressure of 20 mm Hg. DC was performed through an incision in the anterior abdominal wall. BBB integrity was determined by extravasation of 2% Evans blue (EB) dye administered through the femoral vein 1 hour before the mice were killed. BBB permeability was quantified by the EB extravasation method.

   RESULTS: EB content in brain tissue was higher in the IAH 4-hour group (n = 12) compared with their control group (n = 4; p < 0.05), indicating increased permeability of BBB. In the IAH 4-hour + DC 1-hour group (n = 6), EB content in brain tissue was not significantly higher than their respective control group (n = 6).

   CONCLUSION: IAH of 20 mm Hg in mice for 4 hours caused increased BBB permeability. This endothelial barrier dysfunction is reversed by abdominal DC.

Abstract
  The aim of this study was to examine how traumatic spinal cord injury is managed in the United Kingdom via a questionnaire survey of all neurosurgical units. We contacted consultant neurosurgeons and neuroanesthetists in all neurosurgical centers that manage patients with acute spinal cord injury. Two clinical scenarios-of complete and incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries-were given to determine local treatment policies. There were 175 responders from the 33 centers (36% response rate). We ascertained neurosurgical views on urgency of transfer, timing of surgery, nature and aim of surgery, as well as neuroanesthetic views on type of anesthetic, essential intraoperative monitoring, drug treatment, and intensive care management. Approximately 70% of neurosurgeons will admit patients with incomplete spinal cord injury immediately, but only 40% will admit patients with complete spinal cord injury immediately. There is no consensus on the timing or even the role of surgery for incomplete or complete injuries. Most (96%) neuroanesthetists avoid anesthetics known to elevate intracranial pressure. What was deemed essential intraoperative monitoring, however, varied widely. Many (22%) neuroanesthetists do not routinely measure arterial blood pressure invasively, central venous pressure (85%), or cardiac output (94%) during surgery. There is no consensus among neuroanesthetists on the optimal levels of arterial blood pressure, or oxygen and carbon dioxide partial arterial pressure. We report wide variability among U.K. neurosurgeons and neuroanesthetists in their treatment of acute traumatic spinal cord injury. Our findings reflect the lack of Class 1 evidence that early surgical decompression and intensive medical management of patients with spinal cord injury improves neurological outcome.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Intracranial venous hypertension is known to be associated with venous outflow obstruction. We discuss the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical venous outflow obstruction causing pseudotumor cerebri.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report 2 patients presenting with central venous outflow obstruction secondary to osseous compression of the internal jugular veins at the craniocervical junction. The point of jugular compression was between the lateral tubercle of C1 and a prominent, posteriorly located styloid process. In both cases, catheter venography showed high-grade jugular stenosis at the level of C1 with an associated pressure gradient. The dominant jugular vein was decompressed after the styloid process was resected. Postoperative imaging confirmed resolution of the jugular stenosis and normalization of preoperative pressure gradients. In both cases, the symptoms of intracranial hypertension resolved.

   CONCLUSION: Intracranial venous hypertension may result from extrinsic osseous compression of the jugular veins at the skull base. Although rare, this phenomenon is important to recognize because primary stenting not only is ineffective but also may actually exacerbate the outflow obstruction. The osseous impingement of the dominant jugular vein can be relieved via a decompressive styloidectomy, and the clinical results can be excellent.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to explore the volumetric alterations of dural sinuses in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

   METHODS: Standardized cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in 17 patients prior to and following treatment of IIH and in seven controls. Magnetic resonance venographies (MRV) were employed for (a) judgement of circumscript dural sinus stenoses and (b) computation of sinus volumes. Cross-sectional areas (CSA) of the superior sagittal sinuses (SSS) were measured on T2-weighted images. Results of the initial MRIs were compared to those on follow-up MRIs and to results of controls.

   RESULTS: Stenoses of the transverse sinuses (TS) resulting in cranial venous outflow obstruction (CVOO) were present in 15/17 (88%) patients, normalizing in 7/15 cases (47%) after treatment of IIH. CVOO was not detected in the control group. Segmentation of MRV revealed decreased dural sinus volumes in patients with IIH as compared to controls (P = 0.018). Sinus volumes increased significantly with normalization of intracranial pressure independent from disappearing of TS stenoses (P = 0.007). The CSA of the SSS were normal on the initial MRIs of patients with IIH and increased on follow-up after treatment (P < 0.001). However, volumetries displayed overlap in patients and controls.

   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IIH not only exhibit bilateral stenoses of the TS as has been reported, but volume changes of their entire dural sinus system also occur. The potential etiopathological and diagnostic roles of these changes are discussed.

   SETTING: Two tertiary pediatric critical care referral units.

   PATIENTS: Ten children admitted with severe traumatic brain injury defined as Glasgow Coma Score <= 8 necessitating intracranial pressure monitoring (10 yrs +/- 5 SD; range 2-16 yrs).

   INTERVENTIONS: Head elevation was randomly increased or decreased between 0 and 40 degrees from baseline level (30 degrees) in increments or decrements of 10 degrees.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intracranial pressure and arterial blood pressure were continuously recorded in combination with time-stamped clinical notations. Data were available for analysis in eight subjects (seven males and one female; mean age, 10 yrs +/- SD 5; range, 2-16 yrs) during 18 protocol sessions. This resulted in a total of 66 head-of-the-bed challenges. To compare results for a given change in head-of-the-bed elevation across age, we transformed head-of-the-bed angle to change in height (cm) at the level of Monro's foramen. An increase in head elevation of 10 cm resulted in an average change in intracranial pressure of -3.9 mm Hg (SD +/- 3.2 mm Hg; p < .001), whereas cerebral perfusion pressure remained unchanged (0.1 +/- 5.6 mm Hg; p = .957). Individual subjects showed marked variability in intracranial pressure change (range, -8.4 to +1.9 mm Hg/10 cm). The overall regression analysis for intracranial pressure response was change in intracranial pressure = -0.39/cm DELTAh, r2 = 0.42, and p < .001, where DELTAh is the change in vertical height at the level of foramen of Monro attributable to a change in the head of the bed.

   CONCLUSIONS: In severe pediatric traumatic brain injury, the relationship between change in head of the bed and change in intracranial pressure was negative and linear. The lowest intracranial pressure was usually, but not always, achieved at highest head-of-the-bed angles. The effect size of a head-of-the-bed angle change depended, in part, on the subject's height. In contrast, cerebral perfusion pressure was mostly unaffected by head-of-the-bed changes.

Abstract
  We describe two cases of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) developing in a delayed fashion after translabyrinthine resection of cerebellopontine angle tumors. Two patients in an academic tertiary referral center, a 46-year-old woman and a 67-year-old man, underwent translabyrinthine resection of a 2-cm left vestibular schwannoma and a 4-cm left petrous meningioma, respectively. Both patients subsequently developed DAVF, and in each case the diagnosis was delayed despite serial imaging follow-up. In one patient, cerebrospinal fluid diversion before DAVF was identified as the cause of her intracranial hypertension; the other patient was essentially asymptomatic but with a high risk of hemorrhage due to progression of cortical venous drainage. Endovascular treatment was effective but required multiple sessions due to residual or recurrent fistulas. Dural arteriovenous fistula is a rare complication of translabyrinthine skull base surgery. Diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion and an understanding of subtle imaging findings that may be present on follow-up studies performed for tumor surveillance. Failure to recognize this complication may lead to misguided interventions for treatment of hydrocephalus and other complications, as well as ongoing risks related to venous hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage. As this condition is generally curable with neurointerventional and/or surgical methods, timely diagnosis and treatment are essential.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: Positive intrathoracic pressure may cause hemodynamic changes, which can be transmitted to the cranial compartment, changing intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. This can be increased when high positive end-expiratory pressure values are used.

   OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of different positive end-expiratory pressure levels on intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure and mean blood pressure.

   METHOD: This study was conducted in a neurological intensive care unit and included 25 adult hemorrhagic stroke patients who were mechanically ventilated on airway pressure control mode. Patients were subjected to various positive end-expiratory values ranging between 0 and 14 cmH2O. The order of these values were randomized, and the variables were assessed five minutes after each new positive end-expiratory pressure level was initiated.

   RESULTS: Incremental positive end-expiratory pressures led to increased intracranial pressure (p < 0.001), however, no statistically significant changes were observed in mean blood pressure or cerebral perfusion pressure.

   CONCLUSION: In this population of patients with hemorrhagic stroke, positive end-expiratory pressure values up to 14 cmH2O did not alter cerebral perfusion pressure or mean blood pressure. Increased intracranial pressures were noted, although these elevations were not clinically significant.

Abstract
  The primary goal in treating any pediatric patient with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the prevention of secondary insults such as hypotension, hypoxia, and cerebral edema. Despite the publication of guidelines, significant variations in the treatment of severe TBI continue to exist, especially in regards to intracranial pressure (ICP)-guided therapy. This variability in treatment results mainly from a paucity of data from which to create standards and from the heterogeneity inherent in pediatric TBI. The approach to management of severe TBI based on the published guidelines should be focused on ICP control, which should ultimately improve cerebral perfusion pressure. After identifying and surgically evacuating expanding hematomas, the first-tier treatment approach requires placing an ICP monitor. This is accompanied by medical management of elevated ICP, initially with simple maneuvers such as elevating the head of the bed to improve venous drainage, instituting sedation and analgesia to decrease metabolic demands of the brain, and draining cerebrospinal fluid. If these measures fail, then further first-tier interventions include hyperosmolar therapy to decrease cerebral edema and controlled ventilation to decrease cerebral blood volume. For elevations of ICP resistant to first-tier therapies, treatment escalates to second-tier therapy, which includes more aggressive measures such as placing jugular catheters to measure cerebral oxygenation with moderate hyperventilation, placing lumbar drains to remove more cerebrospinal fluid, administering high-dose barbiturates to suppress cerebral electrical activity, inducing hypothermia as a protective measure, and performing decompressive craniectomy to open the cranial vault. To properly execute these interventions, appropriate neuromonitoring is essential, starting from standard physiological parameters such as ICP, mean arterial blood pressure, and temperature. Additional modalities of neurologic monitoring are becoming more readily available and can provide additional clinically useful information about the pediatric patient with TBI; these include cerebral oxygenation, continuous electroencephalography, noninvasive blood flow monitoring, and advanced neuroimaging.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We present Bogota-VAC, a newly modified temporary abdominal closure (TAC) technique for open abdomen condition after abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).

   METHODS: A thin isolation bag (Bogota bag) and a vacuum assisted closure (VAC) system were combined. A matching bag was tension-free fixed on the abdominal fascia by fascia suture. A ring shaped black polyurethane foam of the VAC system was placed into the gap between Bogota bag, abdominal fascia and the wound edge. A constant negative topic pressure of 50-75 mmHg was used in the VAC system.

   RESULTS: Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP: 22 +/- 2 mmHg) of four patients with ACS after severe traumatic brain injury and one patient with isolated ACS after blunt abdominal trauma decreased significantly (p = 0.01) after decompressive laparotomy and treatment with Bogota-VAC (IAP: 10 +/- 2 mmHg) and remained low, measured via urinary bladder pressure. Intracranial pressure (ICP) in the four traumatic brain injury patients decreased from 42 +/- 13 mmHg to 15 +/- 3 mmHg after abdominal decompression. Cerebral perfusion pressure (57 +/- 14 mmHg) increased to 74 +/- 2 mmHg.

   CONCLUSION: The advantage of the presented Bogota-VAC is leak tightness, wound conditioning (soft tissue/fascia), skin protection and facilitation of nursing in combination with highest volume reserve capacity (VRC), thus preventing recurrent increased intra-abdominal and intracranial pressure in the initial phase after decompression of ACS compared to other TAC techniques.

Abstract
  Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) exerts effects not only on intra-abdominal organs, but also on organs distant to the abdominal compartment. Abdomino-thoracic interaction during intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) interferes with pulmonary, cardiovascular and cerebral function. In accordance with recent guidelines, IAH is defined as IAP above 12 mmHg and ACS as IAP more than 20 mmHg with one or more new organ failures. In this review we will first discuss the effects of elevated IAP on pulmonary dynamics and the relevance for interpreting airway pressures and adjusting ventilator settings. We will then discuss the interaction between abdomino-thoracic pressure transmission and global haemodynamics, the knowledge of which is necessary for correct assessment of cardiac preload and to optimize fluid therapy in the setting of IAH/ACS. A discussion on the relationship between increased IAP, increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) will follow. Finally, we will review ventilator-induced thoracic pressure swings and their transmission to the abdominal compartment.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome are a common occurrence in ICU patients. The deleterious effects of IAH on organ function are well known and increasingly appreciated in recent years, especially where renal and respiratory function are concerned.

   METHODS: This review will focus on the available literature from the last years. A Medline and PubMed search was performed in order to find an answer to the question "What is the impact of increased IAP on neurologic function in the critically ill?"

   RESULTS: The amount of data on the influence of IAH on the central nervous system is more scarce, but several animal and human studies have demonstrated a clear correlation between intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP). This correlation is probably due to transmission of the increased IAP to the thorax leading to increased intrathoracic, pleural pressure and central venous pressure, decreased venous return from the brain and increased ICP. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the increase in ICP is abolished when a sternotomy and pleuropericardotomy are performed, and by the fact that abdominal decompression has produced good results in treating refractory intracranial hypertension (ICH) in patients with both IAH and ICH.

   CONCLUSIONS: A close relationship between IAP and ICP has been observed in several animal and human studies. The clinical impact of this association is dependent on the baseline ICP and the compensatory reserve of the patient. Some studies have reported good results in treating refractory ICH by abdominal decompression in patients with concomitant IAH. Monitoring of IAP and ICP in risk patients is essential.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of hypothermia on intracranial pressure, systemic and intracranial hemodynamics, and metabolism in patients with severe traumatic brain injury to clarify the optimal temperature for hypothermia, with a view toward establishing the proper management techniques for such patients.

   METHODS: The study was performed in 31 patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score as high as 5). All patients were sedated, paralyzed, ventilated, and cooled to 33 degrees C. Brain temperature, core temperature, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, jugular venous oxygen saturation, mixed venous oxygen saturation, cardiac output, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and resting energy expenditure were monitored continuously.

   RESULTS: Intracranial pressure decreased significantly at brain temperatures below 37 degrees C and decreased more sharply at temperatures 35 to 36 degrees C, but no differences were observed at temperatures below 35 degrees C. Cerebral perfusion pressure peaked at 35.0 to 35.9 degrees C and decreased with further decreases in temperature. Jugular venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen saturation remained in the normal range during hypothermia. Resting energy expenditure and cardiac output decreased progressively with hypothermia. Oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption decreased to abnormally low levels at rectal temperatures below 35 degrees C, and the correlation between them became less significant at less than 35 degrees C than that when temperatures were 35 degrees C or higher. Brain temperature was consistently higher than rectal temperature by 0.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C.

   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, after traumatic brain injury, decreasing body temperature to 35 to 35.5 degrees C can reduce intracranial hypertension while maintaining sufficient cerebral perfusion pressure without cardiac dysfunction or oxygen debt. Thus, 35 to 35.5 degrees C seems to be the optimal temperature at which to treat patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

Abstract
  Cranial sinovenous disorders comprise a disparate group of illnesses affecting one or more intracranial venous sinuses and cerebral veins, alone or in combination, due to a variety of causes. As medical knowledge advances, fewer and fewer patients have an "idiopathic" diagnosis, with causes clarified in an ever-increasing number of patients. These not only include the long-known puerperal, marantic, infective, and traumatic causes, but in recent years, also a variety of congenital and acquired coagulation disorders, such as protein S, protein C, and antithrombin III deficiency. Certain sinuses are preferentially involved with certain causative entities; for example, cavernous and lateral sinuses are more frequently occluded in relation to infectious processes, either directly or as a parameningeal focus, whereas the superior sagittal sinus is most often occluded by trauma, tumor, or coagulopathy. The optimal treatment of sinovenous occlusion depends on establishing the cause with alacrity, because delays in diagnosis may lead to life-threatening hyperpyrexia, elevations in intracranial pressure, venous infarctions, seizures, coma, and death. However, because up to a third of patients with nonseptic occlusions may survive untreated, with few residua, controversy persists regarding optimal management. There has been a dearth of randomized, prospective treatment trials in this group of disorders. The little data that exist suggest that rapid control of infection, seizure prophylaxis, and anticoagulation must be achieved early so as to prevent progression of thrombosis and intracranial venous hypertension. In recent years, direct retrograde venous thrombolysis has become increasingly available, and has produced such remarkable results that it is likely soon to become the primary treatment of choice for the nontraumatic or nontumoral occlusions.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Preliminary data on the perioperative use of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing craniotomy for brain tumor under general anaesthesia indicate that the intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine is opioid-sparing, results in less need for antihypertensive medication, and may offer greater hemodynamic stability at incision and emergence. Dexmedetomidine, alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist used as adjuvant to anaesthetic agents. Relatively recent studies have shown that dexmedetomidine is able to decrease circulating plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentration in approximately 50%, decreases brain blood flow by directly acting on post-synaptic alpha 2 receptors, decreases CSF pressure without ischemic suffering and effectively decrease brain metabolism and intracranial pressure and also, able to decrease injury caused by focal ischemia.

   PURPOSE: This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was designed to assess the perioperative effect of intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine in patients with supratentorial tumors undergoing craniotomy under general anaesthesia.

   METHODS: Forty patients with CT- scanning proof of supratentorial tumors. The patients were classified equally into 2 groups (twenty patients in each group). Group A:--The dexmedetomidine was given as a bolus dose of 1 microg/kg in 20 minutes before induction of anaesthesia, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.4 microg/kg/hr. The infusion was discontinued when surgery ended. Group B:--The patients received similar volumes of saline.

   RESULTS: The heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure, decreased in patients of group A (dexmedetomidine group) more than group B (placebo group) with significant statistical difference between the two groups (P-value <0.05). No significant statistical difference between the two groups regarding the central venous pressure and arterial partial pressure of Carbon Dioxide (P-value >0.05). The intraoperative end-tidal sevoflurane (%) in patients of group A less than in patients of group B (P-value <0.05). The intracranial pressure decreased in patients of Group A more than group B (P-value <0.05). The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) improved in patients of group A and deteriorated in patients of Group B with significant statistical difference between the two groups (P-value <0.05). The total fentanyl requirements from induction to extubation of patients increased in patients of group B more than in patients of group A (P-value <0.05). The total postoperative patients' requirements for antiemetic drugs within the 2 hours after extubation decreased in patients of group A more than group B (P-value <0.05). The postoperative duration from the end of surgery to extubation decreased significantly in patients of group A more than group B (P-value <0.05). The total urine output during the duration from drug administration to extubation of patients increased in patients of group A more than group B (P-value <0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: Continuous intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine during craniotomy for supratentorial tumors under general anaesthesia maintained the haemodynamic stability, reduced sevoflurane and fentanyl requirements, decreased intracranial pressure, and improved significantly the outcomes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the preoperative effects of acute hypervolemic hemodilution (AHH) on intracranial pressure, cerebral oxygen supply-demand balance and cardiovascular functions of neurosurgical patients.

   METHODS: Approved by hospital ethics committee, a total of 80 ASA grade I/II patients at our hospital during 2009, of either gender aged 18-60 yrs, undergoing elective craniotomy were recruited. The subjects were randomly divided equally into 2 groups: group H (hemodilution) and group C (control) (n = 40 each). After induction, 6% hydroxyethyl starch solution was infused at the rate of 24 mlxkg(-1)xh(-1) in group H, while patients in group C received compound electrolyte solution at the rate of 6 mlxkg(-1)xh(-1). Central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output index (CI), stroke volume variation (SVV) and cerebral spinal fluid pressure (CSFP) were recorded at the following time points: T(Base) (before induction), T(0) (after induction and hemodynamic stabilization), T(30) (after infusion for 30 min) and T(60) (after infusion for 60 min). Blood samples from radial artery and jugular bulb were collected and calculated for systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) and cerebral oxygen uptake rate (CERO(2)). The dosing frequency of vasoactive drugs was also recorded.

   RESULTS: CI in group H was significantly higher than that in group C (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found in both SjvO(2) and CERO(2) between groups and among different points of time (P > 0.05). At the end of AHH, CVP and CSFP were (12 +/- 2.2) mm Hg and (20.0 +/- 2.1) mm Hg respectively. They were significantly higher than that in group C (P < 0.01).

   CONCLUSION: Preoperative AHH in craniotomy will increase CI and maintain the balance of cerebral oxygen supply. But its clinical application is limited in the patient with high intracranial pressure due to the simultaneous increases in CVP and CSFP.

Abstract
  The creation of CO2 pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy causes a series of adverse effects. Impairment of brain oxygen saturation during laparoscopy is a result of increased intra-abdominal pressure, absorbed CO2 and increased intracranial pressure. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible effects of pneumatic inter-mittent sequential compression (ISC) of legs on oxygenation of the brain during laparoscopy. 100 patients, ASA groups 1 and 2, subjected to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups consisting of 50 patients each, group I, control group, and group II, where ISC was applied. Oxygen saturation of the mixed venous blood from the internal jugular vein (SjvO2) is an indirect assessment of cerebral oxygen use (oxygenation of the brain). Blood samples were obtained from the bulb of the right jugular vein, as the dominant side for venous drainage from the brain. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. Blood samples of 2 ml were obtained several times during the operation; the first sample immediately after anesthesia induction in order to establish the baseline values of SjvO2, the second sample immediately after the creation of the pneumoperitoneum, and then every 15 minutes respectively until the end of the pneumoperitoneum. The last sample was obtained before the extubation of the patients. The ISC in group II was terminated after obtaining the last blood sample. Results showed that the average values of oxygen saturation of the mixed venous blood from the internal jugular vein--SjvO2 levels were higher in group II where ISC was applied (82.3%->86.4%->85.3%->80.2%->82.8%->80.4%), compared to group I, without ISC (85.5%->77.8%->80.6%->83.8%->84.8%), statistically significant in the second and third measurement for p<0.05 for the second and the third measurement, i.e. after the creation of pneumoperitoneum, when the decreease in the brain oxygenation is most dramatic in the group without ISC. In conclusion, application of intermittent sequential compression of the legs is a simple and safe technique for preserving the brain oxygenation during laparoscopy by restoring the blood return from the legs.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) are rare vascular lesions of the brain that differ from arteriovenous malformations as they present a direct connection between artery and vein, without interposition of the nidus. They are fed by one or more arterial branches, with a single draining vein. Clinically they can be revealed through cerebral hemorrhage, convulsive crisis, neurological deficit, heart failure in neonates and infants, headache, bruit, or intracranial hypertension symptoms.

   PATIENT AND METHODS: A 30-year-old patient was found unconscious on a public street, presenting a generalized tonic-clonic convulsive crisis. At admission, she presented with ocular proptosis, conjunctival hyperemia and bilateral jugular turgescence. The cranial computed tomography showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the cerebral angiography evidenced a giant intracranial pial AVF with high flow supplied by 2 branches of the left anterior cerebral artery. The patient underwent endovascular treatment in 2 sessions, using a mixture of histoacryl and lipiodol for complete occlusion of the lesion. She was discharged after a month, alert, devoid of motor deficit, and the ocular proptosis and the conjunctival hyperemia had decreased.

   CONCLUSION: AVFs are rare vascular lesions that require prompt treatment. The endovascular treatment must be considered, especially when the lesions are deep and the risks of neurological deficit associated with the surgery are high. Endoscopic intervention represents an effective and safe option for the treatment of this type of lesion. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

Abstract
  AIM OF STUDY: Intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) has been used to treat hypotension and states of hypoperfusion by providing positive pressure ventilation during inspiration followed by augmentation of negative intrathoracic pressure during expiration. This therapy augments cardiac output and lowers intracranial pressure, thereby providing greater circulation to the heart and brain. The effects of IPR on microcirculation remain unknown.

   METHODS: Using a hemorrhagic model, hemodynamics and sublingual microcirculation were evaluated after a 55% blood loss over a 30 min timeframe in 10 female farm pigs (30 kg) previously anesthetized with isoflurane.

   RESULTS: After hemorrhage the mean arterial pressure was 27 +/- 4 mm Hg. Blood cell velocity, the key indicator of microcirculation, was significantly reduced after the bleed from 1033 +/- 175 mcm/s pre-bleed to 147 +/- 60 mcm/s (p < 0.0001). Application of an IPR device reduced airway pressure during expiration to -9 mm Hg after each positive pressure breath (10 mL/kg, 10 breaths/min) and resulted in a rapid increase in systemic hemodynamics and microcirculation. During IPR treatment, average mean arterial pressure increased by 59% to 43 +/- 6 mm Hg (p = 0.002) and blood cell velocity increased by 344% to 506 +/- 99 mcm/s (p = 0.001).

   CONCLUSION: In this animal model, we observed that microcirculation and systemic blood pressures are correlated and may be significantly improved by using IPR therapy. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Syndromes thought to have cerebral venous hypertension as their core, such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension and jugular foramen outlet obstruction, classically result in headaches. Do they provide an insight into the cause of the headache that commonly occurs at altitude? The classic theory of the pathogenesis of high altitude headache has been that it results from increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to hypoxemia in people who have less compliant intracranial volumes (Roach and Hackett, 2001). However, there does not appear to be a correlation between the headache of acute mountain sickness (AMS) and the presence of cerebral edema (Bailey et al, 2006; Wilson et al, 2009). Research has concentrated on arterial perfusion to the brain in hypoxia, but there has been little study of venous drainage. Hypoxia results in markedly increased cerebral blood flow; however, if it has been considered at all, venous outflow has to date been assumed to be of little consequence. Retinal venous distension and the increased venous blood demonstrated by near infra-red spectroscopy and more recently by MRI imply that, in hypoxia, a relative venous insufficiency may exist. Similarly, there is increasing evidence that manifestations of the fluid shift during microgravity is of similar nature to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which is thought to be primarily a venous insufficiency condition. The unique anthropomorphic adaptations of large brained biped humans with cerebral venous systems that have to cope with large changes in hydrostatic pressure may predispose us to conditions of inflow/outflow mismatch. In addition, slight increases in central venous pressures (e.g., from hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction) may further compromise venous outflow at altitude. A better understanding of cerebral venous physiology may enlighten us with regards the pathogenesis of headaches currently considered idiopathic. It may also enable us to trigger headaches for study and hence enable us to develop new treatment strategies.

Abstract
  Pseudotumor cerebri is idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The etiology of this syndrome has not been fully clarified. Excess cerebrospinal fluid production, scarcity of cerebrospinal fluid absorption, intracranial venous pressure elevation, increased intracranial blood volume are all thought to be responsible. The symptoms of the disease may be ordered according to prevalence as follows: headache due to increased intracranial pressure, blurred vision and diplopia. A thirteen-year-old female patient was brought in with complaints of headache, double and blurred vision. Systemic arterial hypertension (140/70 mmHg) was determined. Vesicoureteral reflux was detected as the hypertension etiology. In this article a rare pseudotumor cerebri case is presented secondary to vesicoureteral reflux which caused hypertension.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Preliminary data on the perioperative use of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing craniotomy for brain tumor under general anesthesia indicate that the intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine is opioid-sparing, results in less need for antihypertensive medication, and may offer greater hemodynamic stability at incision and emergence. Dexmedetomidine, alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist, is used as adjuvant to anesthetic agents. Relatively recent studies have shown that dexmedetomidine is able to decrease circulating plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentration in approximately 50%, decreases brain blood flow by directly acting on post-synaptic alpha 2 receptors, decreases CSF pressure without ischemic suffering and effectively decreases brain metabolism and intracranial pressure and also, able to decrease injury caused by focal ischemia.

   PURPOSE: This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was designed to assess the perioperative effect of intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine in patients with supratentorial tumors undergoing craniotomy under general anesthesia.

   METHODS: Fourty patients with CT- scanning proof of supratentorial tumors were classified equally into 2 groups (twenty patients in each group). Group A:--Dexmedetomidine was given as a bolus dose of 1 microg/kg in 20 minutes before induction of anesthesia, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.4 microg/kg/hr. The infusion was discontinued when surgery ended. Group B:--The patients received similar volumes of saline.

   RESULTS: Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure, decreased significantly in patients of group A (dexmedetomidine group) compared to group B (placebo group) (p-value < 0.05). There was no significant statistical difference between the two groups regarding the central venous pressure and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p-value > 0.05). The intraoperative end-tidal sevoflurane (%) in patients of group A was less than in patients of group B (p-value < 0.05). The intracranial pressure decreased in patients of Group A more than group B (p-value < 0.05). The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) improved in patients of group A and deteriorated in patients of Group B with significant statistical difference between the two groups (p-value < 0.05). The total fentanyl requirements from induction to extubation of patients increased in patients of group B more than in patients of group A (p-value < 0.05). The total postoperative patients' requirements for antiemetic drugs within the 2 hours after extubation decreased in patients of group A more than group B (p-value < 0.05). The postoperative duration from the end of surgery to extubation decreased significantly in patients of group A more than group B (p-value < 0.05). The total urine output during the duration from drug administration to extubation of patients increased in patients of group A more than group B (p-value < 0.05).

   CONCLUSION: Continuous intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine during craniotomy for supratentorial tumors under general anesthesia maintained the hemodynamic stability, reduced sevoflurane and fentanyl requirements, decreased intracranial pressure, and improved significantly the outcomes.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The pathogenesis and treatment paradigm for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is controversial. The goal of this article is to review the current literature addressing a relatively new and controversial therapeutic approach for a subset of IIH patients: dural venous sinus stenting.

   RECENT FINDINGS: The debate continues as to whether transverse sinus stenosis is a primary or secondary process relative to raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Transverse sinus stenosis is seen in the majority of patients with IIH and appears to play some role in the disease process. Recent case reports and case series that looked at patients treated with venous sinus stents show encouraging results in decreasing ICP and its related signs and symptoms. Venous sinus stenting could be a treatment option for many patients with IIH.

   SUMMARY: Exactly where in the treatment paradigm endovascular venous sinus stenting falls is unknown. Additional work, preferably controlled prospective studies, needs to be performed to prove its safety and efficacy. Finally, venous sinus stenting should be compared in head-to-head trials with optic nerve sheath fenestration and cerebrospinal fluid diversion surgeries to address its superiority or inferiority relative to these more traditional surgical options.

Abstract
  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) after pediatric spinal deformity surgery has not been previously reported. The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of more than 1500 pediatric spinal surgeries performed between 1992 and 2011. From their analysis, they report on 3 adolescent patients who underwent uncomplicated segmental spinal instrumentation for pediatric spinal deformity correction and subsequently developed features of IIH. The common variables in these 3 patients were adolescent age, spinal deformity, being overweight, symptom onset within 2 weeks postoperatively, significant estimated blood loss, and intraoperative use of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (antifibrinolytic) injection. The authors postulate that the development of IIH could be the result of venous outflow obstruction due to derangement of the epidural venous plexus during surgery. The use of epsilon-aminocaproic acid could potentially have the risk of causing IIH, probably mediated through hyperfibrinogenemia, although there have not been published cases in the neurosurgical, orthopedic, cardiac, or general surgical literature. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension after spinal deformity correction is a condition that should be recognized by neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons, because appropriate intervention with early medical therapy can lead to a satisfactory clinical outcome.

Abstract
  OBJECT: Negative-pressure and low-pressure hydrocephalus are rare clinical entities that are frequently misdiagnosed. They are characterized by recurrent episodes of shunt failure because the intracranial pressure is lower than the opening pressure of the valve. In this report the authors discuss iatrogenic CSF leaks as a cause of low- or negative-pressure hydrocephalus after approaches to the cranial base.

   METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed cases of low-pressure or negative-pressure hydrocephalus presenting after cranial approaches complicated with a CSF leak at their institution.

   RESULTS: Three patients were identified. Symptoms of high intracranial pressure and ventriculomegaly were present, although the measured pressures were low or negative. A blocked communication between the ventricles and the subarachnoid space was documented in 2 of the cases and presumed in the third. Shunt revisions failed repeatedly. In all cases, temporary clinical and radiographic improvement resulted from external ventricular drainage at subatmospheric pressures. The CSF leaks were sealed and CSF communication was reestablished operatively. In 1 case, neck wrapping was used with temporary success.

   CONCLUSIONS: Negative-pressure or low-pressure hydrocephalus associated with CSF leaks, especially after cranial base approaches, is difficult to treat. The solution often requires the utilization of subatmospheric external ventricular drains to establish a lower ventricular drainage pressure than the drainage pressure created in the subarachnoid space, where the pressure is artificially lowered by the CSF leak. Treatment involves correction of the CSF leak, neck wrapping to increase brain turgor and allow the pressure in the ventricles to rise to the level of the opening pressure of the valve, and reestablishing the CSF route.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transverse sinus stenosis is common in patients with IIH. While the role of transverse sinus stenosis in IIH pathogenesis remains controversial, modeling studies suggest that stent placement within a transverse sinus stenosis with a significant pressure gradient should decrease cerebral venous pressure, improve CSF resorption in the venous system, and thereby reduce intracranial (CSF) pressure, improving the symptoms of IIH and reducing papilledema. We aimed to determine if IIH could be reliably treated by stent placement in transverse sinus stenosis.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical, venographic, and intracranial pressure data before and after stent placement in transverse sinus stenosis in 52 of our own patients with IIH unresponsive to maximum acceptable medical treatment, treated since 2001 and followed between 2 months and 9 years.

   RESULTS: Before stent placement, the mean superior sagittal sinus pressure was 34 mm Hg (462 mm H(2)0) with a mean transverse sinus stenosis gradient of 20 mm Hg. The mean lumbar CSF pressure before stent placement was 322 mm H(2)O. In all 52 patients, stent placement immediately eliminated the TSS pressure gradient, rapidly improved IIH symptoms, and abolished papilledema. In 6 patients, symptom relapse (headache) was associated with increased venous pressure and recurrent stenosis adjacent to the previous stent. In these cases, placement of another stent again removed the transverse sinus stenosis pressure gradient and improved symptoms. Of the 52 patients, 49 have been cured of all IIH symptoms.

   CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a role for transverse sinus stent placement in the management of selected patients with IIH.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The cause of pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension (BIH), is controversial. We report our results from 18 cases of venous sinus stenting (VSS), the largest series in the literature, with specific focus on the rate of technical success, amelioration of the subjective symptom of headache, attendant complications, and radiographic patency on follow-up.

   METHODS: Review of our prospectively maintained database identified 18 patients who had undergone 19 VSS procedures for the placement of 30 stents in the past 2.5 years. Indications for treatment included a clinical diagnosis of BIH with venographic demonstration of stenosis.

   RESULTS: VSS was technically successful in all patients (100%). No patient suffered a permanent complication. Three patients were lost to follow-up. The remaining 15 patients were followed clinically and asked to rate their headache severity on a scale of 1 to 10 both before and after VSS. Overall, 12 patients (80%) qualified their headaches as better after VSS, two stated that they were the same, and one patient said that they were worse. Of 14 patients who underwent follow-up angiography, all demonstrated normal patency of the stented segments. In one of these patients, stenosis was detected on follow-up in the unstented segment of the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb.

   CONCLUSIONS: VSS is highly effective (80%) in ameliorating headache associated with BIH. The procedure is associated with a high rate of technical success (100%), a low rate of permanent complications (0), and a high rate of stent patency on follow-up angiography (100%).

Abstract
  Hemorrhagic shock is a common cause of mortality and morbidity in the pediatric population. Intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) lowers intrathoracic pressure, thereby decreasing intracranial pressure and increasing venous return, cardiac output, and cerebral perfusion without the need for immediate fluid resuscitation. We hypothesized that IPR would improve hemodynamics and 24-h survival in a pediatric porcine model of hemorrhagic shock. Twenty piglets were subjected to a 50% total blood volume hemorrhage over 15 min and then randomized to treatment with either IPR or no treatment. After 60 min, survivors were autotransfused, weaned from the ventilator, and assessed and autopsied at 24 h. Mean arterial pressures (MAPs), cardiac index (CI), and arterial blood gases were recorded. MAP (mm Hg) was significantly higher in the IPR group (60.8 +/- 3.7) versus controls (41.2 +/- 4.6, p < 0.01). Mean CI (L/min/m2) was significantly higher with IPR (3.9 +/- 0.24) versus controls (2.5 +/- 0.39, p < 0.01). IPR survival rates were significantly improved with IPR [9/9 (IPR) versus 5/11 (controls); p < 0.02]. In this piglet model of hemorrhagic shock, IPR treatment safely and significantly improved MAP, CI, and 24-h survival rates.

Abstract
  A sharp rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) was noted in a 6-year-old girl with Fontan circulation after surgical removal of a hematoma associated with intracranial hemorrhage. Inhalation of nitric oxide resulted in reduction of central venous pressure (CVP) and precipitous fall in ICP, which was otherwise resistant to conventional therapy. Specifically, the rate of fall of ICP (9 mm Hg) exceeded that of the CVP (3 mm Hg), indicating disproportionate CVP-ICP coupling. The present case provides not only a novel insight into cardio-cerebral interaction in Fontan physiology but also useful information regarding the treatment of Fontan patients in the setting of increased ICP.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Intracranial hypertension is a crucial modifiable risk factor for poor outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Limited evidence suggests that decompressive laparotomy may be an effective treatment for refractory ICH in patients who have elevated intra-abdominal pressure.

   METHODS: Case report.

   RESULTS: We present a multi-trauma patient who sustained severe TBI in a motor vehicle collision. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was initially medically managed but became refractory to standard therapies. Emergent decompressive laparotomy performed in the surgical intensive care unit for abdominal compartment syndrome concomitantly improved the patient's ICP.

   CONCLUSIONS: Elevated intra-abdominal pressure can exacerbate intracranial hypertension in patients with TBI. Recognition of this condition and treatment with decompressive laparotomy may be useful in patients with intracranial hypertension refractory to optimal medical therapy.

Abstract
  Acute ischemic stroke therapy emphasizes early arterial clot lysis or removal. Partial aortic occlusion has recently emerged as an alternative hemodynamic approach to augment cerebral perfusion in acute ischemic stroke. The exact mechanism of cerebral flow augmentation with partial aortic occlusion remains unclear and may involve more than simple diversion of arterial blood flow from the lower body to cerebral collateral circulation. The cerebral venous steal hypothesis suggests that even a small increase in tissue pressure in the ischemic area will divert blood flow to surrounding regions with lesser tissue pressures. This may cause no-reflow (absence of flow after restoration of arterial patency) in the ischemic core and "luxury perfusion" in the surrounding regions. Such maldistribution may be reversed with increased venous pressure titrated to avoid changes in intracranial pressure. We propose that partial aortic occlusion enhances perfusion in the brain by offsetting cerebral venous steal. Partial aortic occlusion redistributes blood volume into the upper part of the body, manifested by an increase in central venous pressure. Increased venous pressure recruits the collapsed vascular network and, by eliminating cerebral venous steal, corrects perifocal perfusion maldistribution analogous to positive end-expiratory pressure recruitment of collapsed airways to decrease ventilation/perfusion mismatch in the lungs.

Abstract
  Elevated intracranial intravenous pressure is not routinely measured in clinical practice. Indirect evidence of increased venous pressure is reflected in the size change of the cerebral sinuses and the presence of venous infarctions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of brain perfusion venous time-density curves in the diagnosis of cerebral venous hypertension. A retrospective review of four cases in which increased cerebral intravenous pressure was reflected in abnormal time-density curves on CT brain perfusion studies was completed. The abnormal venous time-density curves correlated with clinically increased intravenous pressure and normalized after treating the underlying pathology. Abnormal venous outflow affects brain perfusion. This could be identified on a CT brain-perfusion study based on characteristic venous time-density curves. These curves may appear quite similar even when the underlying etiologies are different. Normalization of the venous time-density curves may be observed after the underlying pathology was treated.

Abstract
  We review the physiology and affects of inspiration through a low level of added resistance for the treatment of hypotension. Recent animal and clinical studies demonstrated that one of the body's natural response mechanisms to hypotension is to harness the respiratory pump to increase circulation. That finding is consistent with observations, in the 1960s, about the effect of lowering intrathoracic pressure on key physiological and hemodynamic variables. We describe studies that focused on the fundamental relationship between the generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration through a low level of resistance created by an impedance threshold device and the physiologic sequelae of a respiratory pump. A decrease in intrathoracic pressure during inspiration through a fixed resistance resulting in a pressure difference of 7 cm H(2)O has multiple physiological benefits, including: enhanced venous return and cardiac stroke volume, lower intracranial pressure, resetting of the cardiac baroreflex, elevated cerebral blood flow oscillations, increased tissue blood flow/pressure gradient, and maintenance of the integrity of the baroreflex-mediated coherence between arterial pressure and sympathetic nerve activity. While breathing has traditionally been thought primarily to provide gas exchange, studies of the mechanisms involved in animals and humans provide the physiological underpinnings for "the other side of breathing": to increase circulation to the heart and brain, especially in the setting of physiological stress. The existing results support the use of the intrathoracic pump to treat clinical conditions associated with hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, hypotension during and after hemodialysis, hemorrhagic shock, heat stroke, septic shock, and cardiac arrest. Harnessing these fundamental mechanisms that control cardiopulmonary physiology provides new opportunities for respiratory therapists and others who have traditionally focused on ventilation to also help treat serious and often life-threatening circulatory disorders.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The amplitude of spontaneous retinal venous pulsations (SRVP) is known to be affected by intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal venous pressure, and intracranial pressure (ICP). This study characterized SRVPs adjacent to the disc and quantified changes in the amplitude of these pulsations during IOP manipulation in normal subjects.

   METHODS: The study included 12 subjects (40 +/- 15, 4 females, 8 males). Baseline IOP (range 10-25 mmHg) was measured and SRVP recorded using the dynamic retinal vessel analyzer (DVA). IOP was lowered using aproclonidine 0.5% and measured every 15 min, followed by dynamic recording of SRVP. Two subjects were also tested with timolol 0.5%, and three were treated with a placebo drop. Mean amplitude of SRVP was determined within each sample at the same site. Blood pressure and heart rate were tracked continuously.

   RESULTS: Amplitude of SRVP decreased in all subjects with reduction of IOP with aproclonidine and timolol. Mean SRVP amplitude was 8.5 +/- 6 mcm at baseline and reduced to 2.5 +/- 1.8 mcm after 45 min (p < 0.0001). IOP fell from 14.4 +/- 2.6 mmHg to 10.2 +/- 2.9 mmHg over the same period (p < 0.001). Venous diameter, blood pressure, and heart rate did not change significantly from the baseline. Analysis of waveforms showed a slight phase shift only (150 +/- 78.5 ms, p = 0.93) between disc veins and adjacent retinal vein.

   CONCLUSION: SRVPs in the peripapillary retina have similar waveform characteristics to those at the disc. SRVP amplitudes are reduced by manipulation of IOP downwards with pharmacological intervention. The relationship was consistent in all individuals tested for two classes of drugs and was independent of BP or heart rate changes.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury or intracranial hemorrhage patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome need mechanical ventilation. The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in this situation remains controversial. This study explored the impact of PEEP on intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), central venous pressure (CVP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in cerebral injury patients.

   METHODS: Nine cerebral injury patients with lung injury who needed mechanical ventilation and met the criteria for ICP monitoring were included in this study. Intraventricular catheters were positioned in 1 of the bilateral ventricles and connected to pressure transducers. Invasive arterial pressure and CVP were monitored continuously. Pressure control ventilation was applied during this clinical trial in a stepwise recruitment maneuver (RM) with 3 cm H2O intermittent increments and decrements of PEEP.

   RESULTS: A total of 28 RMs were completed in 9 patients. Mean values of MAP, CVP, ICP, and CPP 5 minutes after RMs showed no significant differences compared with baseline (P > 0.05). Correlation analysis of all the mean values of MAP, CVP, ICP, and CPP showed significant correlation between MAP and CPP, PEEP and CVP, PEEP and ICP, and PEEP and CPP with all P values less than 0.05.

   CONCLUSION: The impact of PEEP on blood pressure, ICP, and CPP varies greatly in cerebral injury patients. Mean arterial pressure and ICP monitoring is of benefit when using PEEP in cerebral injury patients with hypoxemia. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Pseudotumor cerebri is a condition characterized by raised intracranial pressure, normal CSF contents, and normal brain with normal or small ventricles on imaging studies. It affects predominantly obese women of childbearing age; however, its incidence seems to be increasing among adolescent and children. While among older children the clinical picture is similar to that of adults, younger children present demographic and clinical peculiarities. Different diagnostic criteria for adults and pre-pubertal children have been proposed. Etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear, particular concerning the role of obstruction to venous outflow.

   METHODS: An extensive literature review concerning all the aspects of pseudotumor cerebri has been performed, both among adults and pre-pubertal children.

   CONCLUSION: Pseudotumor cerebri is an avoidable cause of visual loss, both in adults and children. Few diagnostic measures are usually sufficient to determine the correct diagnosis. Since pseudotumor cerebri is a diagnosis of exclusion, the differential diagnosis work out is of special importance. Modern neuroimaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography may clarify the role of obstruction to venous outflow in each case. Various therapeutic options are available: medical, surgical, and endovascular procedures may be used to prevent irreversible visual loss. Treatment is usually effective, and most patients will experience complete resolution of symptoms without persistent deficits.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare but potentially severe condition in children. We present the case of a teenager with corticodependent nephrotic syndrome diagnosed at five months of age and treated with cyclosporine A. In the context of recurrence of nephrotic syndrome he presented with headache, vomiting and severe intracranial hypertension. While the raised intracranial pressure and the status epilepticus were controlled, the brain imaging revealed venous thrombosis of all venous sinus, with absence of venous drainage. He was submitted to local thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, with recanalization of the venous sinuses. The outcome was favourable, without neurological deficits. In this case, the early radiologic intervention was crucial, enabling a full neurological recovery, in a teenager whose initial prognosis was very poor.

Abstract
  Neuro-ophthalmologists frequently care for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), although many questions remain unanswered regarding its diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment. The Friedman-Jacobson criteria for the diagnosis of IIH specify lumbar puncture (LP) opening pressure values that are largely based on experience with little supporting normative data. Until recently, there were sparse data to define normal values of the LP opening pressure in children. Papilledema, the sine qua non of IIH, may not always be present, but the frequency of true IIH without papilledema is controversial and the threshold for diagnosing it varies among clinicians. Concepts regarding the pathogenesis of IIH continue to evolve; venous hypertension is certainly implicated even though it is uncertain whether venous sinus stenosis is the cause or effect of increased intracranial pressure. The 2010 Jacobson Lecture discusses the evidence for some of the prevailing assumptions about normal lumbar puncture opening pressure, venous sinus stenosis, and the phenotypic continuum between chronic daily headaches and IIH.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To quantify the course of papilledema using the OCT 3 Stratus (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA) after lateral sinus stent placement in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

   METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with a diagnosis of IIH underwent OCT examination before and after lateral sinus stenting, between March 2006 and April 2008, in Timone Hospital's Ophthalmology Department (Marseille, France). All patients had criteria for IIH (International Headache Society, 2004) and sinus abnormalities were diagnosed using three-dimensional rotational gadolinium-enhanced MR venography. In all cases, a direct retrograde cerebral venography with manometry was performed. We used the Cordis PRECISE R RX Nitinol Stent system (ref. 10136245-3, Johnson & Johnson), 30-40 mm in length and 8 mm in diameter, all placed by a single operator via a femoral venous puncture. For each eye, the mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was noted using the RNFL Thickness (3.4) strategy, before stenting, and three times after stent placement. The other parameters considered were age, sex, weight, height and body mass index.

   RESULTS: A significant decrease in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was observed after stent placement. This parameter was considered normal 3 months after stent placement for eight of ten patients.

   CONCLUSION: Even though this pathology remains misunderstood, we observed a significant decrease in papilledema in IIH after lateral sinus stent placement, suggesting that high intracranial venous pressure could play a role in this pathology.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Hypertonic saline and/or norepinephrine infusion are routinely used to achieve a desired cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in the management of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We hypothesized that creatinine clearances (CrCls) would be significantly augmented in this setting.

   METHODS: This was an observational cohort study in TBI patients older than 16 years with normal serum creatinine concentrations, requiring maintenance of CPP. Eight-hour urinary CrCl collections were performed while on and off active management. Demographic data, use of vasoactive medications, fluid balance, feeding regimen, and hemodynamic variables were recorded throughout the study period. Augmented CrCl was defined as >150 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in women and >160 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in men.

   RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled, and augmented clearances were demonstrated in 17 (85%). The mean maximum CrCl was 179 mL/min/1.73 m(2) while receiving CPP therapy (95% confidence interval [CI], 159-198), returning to a mean of 111 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (95% CI, 91-131; P < 0.001) when measured after discharge from the intensive care unit. The mean CrCl in the intensive care unit while not receiving CPP therapy was 150 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (95% CI, 134-167; P = 0.03). The mean time to reach peak CrCl while receiving active treatment was 4.7 days (95% CI, 3.0-6.4). In a multivariate analysis, norepinephrine use, saline loading, mean arterial blood pressure, and central venous pressure were associated with augmented CrCl on the day of measurement.

   CONCLUSIONS: Augmented CrCls are common in TBI patients receiving active management of CPP and persist even after discontinuation of such therapy. Further work is needed to clarify the impact of such clearances on renally excreted drugs in this setting.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlative factors of traumatic embolism in superficial cerebral vein and explore their corresponding treatments.

   METHODS: A total of 74 cases were divided into 3 groups according to their injury mechanisms. Group A: traumatic brain injury in superficial cerebral vein with cerebral contusion, acute intracerebral hematoma and subdural hematoma in the same place; Group B: traumatic brain injury in superficial cerebral vein with acute intracerebral hematoma, subdural hematoma and skull fracture in the same place; Group C: traumatic brain injury in superficial cerebral vein with acute subdural hematoma and skull fracture in the same place, without cerebral contusion or acute intracerebral hematoma. They were divided into different groups according to gender, age, pre-operative GCS and cerebral hernia.

   RESULTS: Among 74 cases, 28, 39 and 7 cases belonged to groups A, B and C respectively. There was significant difference among injured veins in three groups (P < 0.01). Cerebral infarction was found in 37 cases in groups A and B while only 2 cases in group C. Cerebral infarction had no correlation with sex, age, pre-operative GCS and cerebral hernia.

   CONCLUSION: Injuries in superficial cerebral vein are mainly caused by skull fracture, contre-coup injury and shearing force. Cerebral infarction often exists if there is cerebral contusion. It is necessary to protect injured primary superficial cerebral veins and ambient venous network, remove intracranial hematoma and large bone flap to reduce intracranial hypertension and dilute blood post-operatively to prevent venous embolism.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To observe the repercussion of respiratory physiotherapy techniques on the mean arterial pressure (MBP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), jugular venous oxygen pressure (PjvO2) and jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2).

   METHOD: The sample consisted of 20 patients with head trauma. The protocol consisted of physiotherapy techniques application of vibrocompression (VBC), expiratory flow increase (EFI) and suction.

   RESULTS: The results show the maintenance on variables of cerebral hemodynamics during the techniques of VBC and EFI. However, in relation to suction, there was an increase of MBP, ICP, with maintenance of CPP, PjvO2 and SjvO2 and return to baseline of MBP and ICP 10 minutes after the end of suction.

   CONCLUSION: The respiratory physiotherapy techniques (VBC, EFI) do not promote cerebral hemodynamic repercussion, unlike suction, in severe head injury patients, mechanically ventilated, sedated and paralyzed.

Abstract
  There seems to be an association between type 1 Chiari malformation (CM) and some congenital craniosynostosis syndromes. Type 2 Pfeiffer syndrome is a condition associated with premature fusion of multiple cranial sutures, cloverleaf skull (kleeblatschadel deformity), prominent ptosis, thumb and first toe abnormalities, variable syndactyly, and mutated genes for type 1 or 2 fibroblast growth factor receptor. These children generally do poorly because of significant often severe neurologic and cognitive defects, and many die very young. Roughly half of all patients with Pfeiffer syndrome, and virtually all with type 2 disease, also have type 1 CM. Chiari malformation may not be congenital but acquired as a consequence of the skull deformities and other associated intracranial factors in patients with craniosynostosis. We report a term male infant with type 2 Pfeiffer syndrome, who was not noted to have any CM on initial brain imaging done at 2 months but in whom repeated imaging demonstrated clear evidence of CM by 4 months, despite reconstructive craniotomies and unilateral ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion. Posterior fossa decompression yielded a good result. This patient provides further evidence to support the concept of acquired tonsillar herniation in patients with craniosynostosis syndromes. The etiology seems multifactorial and related to (1) the disproportionately slow growth of the skull relative to the brain, particularly in the posterior fossa, secondary to early fusion of skull sutures, in turn secondary to congenital deficiencies in fibroblast growth factor receptors; (2) impaired venous sinus drainage; (3) hydrocephalus; and (4) resultant elevations in intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  SUMMARY: Cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVT) is a rare form of thrombosis, with many different clinical manifestations. Better imaging techniques have greatly improved the diagnosis, but as a result of the paucity of controlled trials, choosing the optimal treatment for each patient often remains a challenge. Heparin is generally considered the mainstay of treatment, supported by data from a few small trials. More invasive treatment options are available, such as endovascular thrombolysis and--in more severe cases--decompressive hemicraniectomy. Furthermore, CVT is often accompanied by various neurological complications, such as seizures and intracranial hypertension, which require specific treatment. In this review we summarize the available treatment options for CVT and suggest which therapy should be reserved for which patients.

Abstract
  Intracranial pressure (ICP) is derived from cerebral blood pressure and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulatory dynamics and can be affected in the course of many diseases. Computer analysis of the ICP time pattern plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of those diseases. This study proposes the application of Linninger et al.'s [IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., vol. 52, no. 4, pp. 557-565, Apr. 2005] fluid-solid interaction model of CSF hydrodynamic in ventricular system based on our clinical data from a group of patients with brain parenchyma tumor. The clinical experiments include the arterial blood pressure (ABP), venous blood pressure, and ICP in the subarachnoid space (SAS). These data were used as inputs to the model that predicts the intracranial dynamic phenomena. In addition, the model has been modified by considering CSF pulsatile production rate as the major factor of CSF motion. The approximations of ventricle enlargement, CSF pressure distribution in the ventricular system and CSF velocity magnitude in the aqueduct and foramina were obtained in this study. The observation of reversal flow in the CSF flow pattern due to brain tissue compression is another finding in our investigation. Based on the experimental results, no existence of large transmural pressure differences were found in the brain system. The measured pressure drop in the ventricular system was less than 5 Pa. Moreover, the CSF flow pattern, ICP distribution, and velocity magnitude were in good agreement with the published models and CINE (phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging) experiments, respectively.

Abstract
  The surgical approach in a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in need of abdominal surgery remains controversial. The risk of increased intracranial pressure with pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopy is still unresolved. We used the LapDisc (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, New Jersey) to access the shunt and temporarily seal it, which enabled us to perform laparoscopic resection of endometriosis without subjecting the shunt to high intraabdominal pressure. The benefits of this approach are the ability to perform laparoscopy, less skin-to-shunt contact minimizing infection, and elimination of possible increased intracranial pressure secondary to pneumoperitoneum. With the progress made in the management of hydrocephalus, patients with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts enjoy a longer lifespan. Therefore, the gynecologic laparoscopic surgeon can expect to treat a patient with a VP shunt in place. Copyright (c) 2010 AAGL. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Swelling is inexorably linked to shock and resuscitation in trauma. In many forms, swelling complicates and interacts with traumatic injury to raise pressures in the abdomen, resulting in intraabdominal hypertension, which may overtly manifest as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) driving multiple organ failure. Despite renewed clinical interest in posttraumatic intraabdominal pressure, there remains a chiasm between knowledge of the risks and clinical interventions to mitigate them. This review provides a concise overview of definitions, risk factors, diagnosis and management using an illustrative trauma case.

   RECENT FINDINGS: Intraabdominal pressure commonly increases following trauma, wherein ACS may manifest earlier than generally appreciated and complicate other insults such as shock and hemorrhage. Contemporary resuscitation strategies may exacerbate intraabdominal hypertension, particularly massive crystalloid resuscitation. Although unproven, the recent transition to crystalloid restriction and high plasma resuscitation strategies may influence the prevalence of ACS. Nonetheless, aggressive intraabdominal pressure monitoring should be mandatory in the critically ill. Despite potential nonoperative options, decompressive laparotomy remains the only definitive but often morbid treatment.

   SUMMARY: ACS results from many dysfunctions acting in concert with each other in self-propagating vicious cycles. Starting with greater awareness, it is imperative that the growing knowledge should be translated into clinical practice. [References: 47]

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pathophysiology of IIH remains unknown. TS stenoses have been observed in a high proportion of these patients. Stent placement to remove this potential obstruction to venous outflow has been proposed as a treatment option for patients with IIH refractory to medical treatment.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with refractory IIH evaluated for venous sinus stent placement at a tertiary care center was retrospectively reviewed.

   RESULTS: Thirteen female patients with IIH were evaluated for sinovenous stent placement. Moderate sinus stenoses with normal intrasinus pressures were found in 3 patients and therefore stent placement was not performed. Ten patients had elevated intrasinus pressures (pressure gradient across stenosis, 11-50 mm Hg), which decreased following unilateral TS stent placement. Headaches improved or resolved in all stented patients. Papilledema resolved completely or almost completely in 8 patients and significantly improved in 2 patients. One patient developed optic atrophy. There were no major periprocedural complications.

   CONCLUSIONS: In this small case series, restoring the patency of stenotic venous sinuses with a stent in patients with refractory IIH resulted in symptomatic improvement in all treated patients. The safety and efficacy of this procedure should be evaluated in a randomized controlled study to determine its role within the armamentarium of therapeutic options for patients with IIH.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Chronic herniation syndromes other than tonsillar herniation are not well-recognized. Transtentorial uncal herniation in its chronic form has been reported in only few case reports (Horowitz et al., J Neuroimaging 12:78-79, 2002; Naidich et al., Radiology 158:431-434, 1986; Ng and Valiante, J Clin Neurosci 16:944, 2009; Ng and Valiante, J Clin Neurosci 16:984, 2009). We hereby illustrate a case with this rare finding, including MR imaging, and analyze this phenomenon.

   CASE REPORT: A 15-year-old girl had a resection of a cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma at 5 years of age. Two months later, she underwent a cystoperitoneal shunt for persistent headache and pseudomeningocele, secondary to an enlarging cyst at the tumor bed. Subsequently, her shunt was upgraded to a more conservative valve following clinical evidence of over drainage. This was also associated with imaging compatible with bilateral uncal herniation. After the procedure, she had relief of symptoms.

   CONCLUSION: We conclude that a negative pressure gradient in the posterior fossa, relative to the supratentorial compartment, is the etiology of the chronic uncal herniation in our patient. Comparing the case reports in the literature with our case, we postulate that chronic uncal herniation is a complication of shunting of a posterior fossa fluid cavity in children, many of them with Dandy-Walker syndrome and/or other cerebellar cystic formations. The treatment priority at presentation should be to rule out shunt malfunction. In the event of association with clinical over-drainage syndrome, there may be a role for changing the shunt system into a more conservative drainage combination. [References: 15]

Abstract
  Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has revolutionised wound care. Yet, it is still not understood how hypobaric tissue pressure accelerates wound healing. There is very little reported on the relevant physics of any substance subjected to suction in this manner. The common assumption is that applying suction to a substance is likely to result in a reduction of pressure in that substance. Although more than 250 research articles have been published on NPWT, there are little data verifying whether suction increases or decreases the pressure of the substance it is applied to. Clarifying this basic question of physics is the first step in understanding the mechanism of action of these dressings. In this study, pressure changes were recorded in soft plasticene and processed meat, using an intracranial tissue pressure microsensor. Circumferential, non-circumferential and cavity NPWT dressings were applied, and pressure changes within the underlying substance were recorded at different suction pressures. Pressures were also measured at 1cm, 2 cm and 3 cm from the NPWT placed in a cavity. In all three types of NPWT dressings, the underlying substance pressure was increased (hyperbaric) as suction pressure increased. Although there was a substantial pressure increase at 1cm, the rise in pressure at the 2-cm and 3-cm intervals was minimal. Substance pressure beneath all types of NPWT dressing is hyperbaric in inanimate substances. Higher suction pressures generate greater substance pressures; however, the increased pressure rapidly dissipates as the distance from the dressing is increased. The findings of this study on inanimate objects suggest that we may need to review our current perception of the physics underlying NPWT dressings. Further research of this type on living tissues is warranted. Copyright (c) 2009 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Raised intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) accompanied by evidence of organ dysfunction constitutes abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). The ACS is now becoming an increasingly recognised fatal entity in the critically ill surgical and traumatized patients receiving critical care. The objectives were to determine the frequency of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in critically ill surgical and traumatised patients and to identify the risk factors associated with its development in our patients.

   METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted at Department of Surgery, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad from July 2004 to February 2005. Two hundred critically ill adult surgical and traumatised patients who needed catheterisation were included in the study. Patients who had cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, status asthmaticus, bladder outflow obstruction, pre-existing end organ failure and those not consenting to participate in the study were excluded. Diagnosis of the underlying surgical condition was made by history, physical examination and necessary investigations. The main diagnostic tool employed for detecting ACS was the measurement of intra-cystic pressure (ICP) which was taken as an indirect measure of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). It was measured four hourly by employing simple fluid column manometry method. Blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, respiratory rate and urine output were recorded 4 hourly. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) and renal function tests (RFTs) were performed daily. ACS was diagnosed on the basis of raised IAP of >10 mmHg coupled with evidence of one or more end organ failure. A variety of risk factors that lead to ACS were studied among the patients.

   RESULTS: Out of 200 patients, six had ACS. The overall frequency was thus 3%. The M:F was 2:1. Most of the patients were in the age range of 31-40 years. Severe peritonitis, severe gut oedema, SIRS and tense ascites were recognised as statistically significant risk factors for the development of ACS. All patients with ACS had features of multiorgan dysfunction. There was 80% in-hospital mortality among the ACS sufferers.

   CONCLUSION: ACS develops in a significant number of critically ill and traumatised patients developing quickly and proving fatal without ACS specific interventions. All such high risk patients should undergo serial ICP measurements as a screening test for early detection of ACS.

Abstract
  Chemosis of the eyes is usually attributed to carotid cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulae. Herein, we reviewed unusual cases in which chemosis of the eyes originated from dural ateriovenous fistulae (dAVFs) that were distinctly different from carotid cavernous sinus fistulae. Cases in which ocular symptoms were related to increased intracranial pressure either due to sinus thrombosis or cortical venous drainage without involvement of superior or inferior ophthalmic veins were excluded in this review. Several different types of dural AVFs were associated with chemosis, and these included dAVFs harboring a feeding artery from branches of the external carotid artery directly draining to the superior ophthalmic vein or cavernous sinus via the superior petrous sinus, posterior fossa dAVFs draining via the inferior petrous sinus and cavernous sinus to the ophthalmic vein, a fistula between the ophthalmic artery or branches of the internal carotid artery and inferior ophthalmic vein, or tentorial fistula with a drainage vein to the cavernous sinus via the vein of Galen. This study reviews the symptomatology, treatment options, and cerebrovascular abnormalities observed for these unusual dAVF's with chemosis.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Current neuro-radiological techniques have led to a more frequent diagnosis of cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT), and revealed its greater clinical heterogeneity.

   AIM: To analize the characteristics of the cases with the diagnosis of CVT in our unit between 1996 and 2008.

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe 20 cases of CVT (14 women and 6 men), with ages of 22 to 75 years.

   RESULTS: Headache was the most frequent symptom, followed by intracranial hypertension, disorders of consciousness and focal deficits. Unusual presentations included transitory ischemia and progressive optical neuropathy. Subacute and chronic courses were more frequent than acute. The etiology was diverse including puerperium, contraception, hyperthyroidism, meningitis, Leiden V factor mutation, multiple myeloma, Crohn, ulcerative colitis, meningioma and epidural anesthesia. No cause was found in 8 cases. Magnetic resonance imaging was always diagnostic. Patients were anticoagulated during the acute phase. In subacute or chronic presentations, a more conservative treatment was considered on individual basis. Only 6 patients had mild sequelae.

   CONCLUSIONS: We report a great variety of etiologies and patterns of presentation of CVT. CVT should be suspected in patients with subacute headache, even in outpatients. Nonacute presentation with isolated headache or intracranial hypertension could have better prognosis, requiring a less aggressive therapy.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Pseudotumor cerebri (PC) is a complex syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure in the absence of any space occupying lesion, usually self-limiting, but often relapsing In recent years, some authors had researched the relationship between venous sinus disease and PC and they have suggested that it must be ruled out by magnetic resonance venography (MRV) before diagnosing this condition as idiopathic. Our aim is to determine the frequency of venous sinus disease and the need for MRV in these patients.

   METHODS: We have studied 14 patients admitted between 1998 and 2005 in the Neurology Department of the University Clinical Hospital <<Lozano Blesa>> (Zaragoza; Spain) who had been diagnosed of PC. We reviewed the epidemiological and clinical features. The MRVs were reviewed and their appearances rated for focal narrowing and signal gaps.

   RESULTS: Six patients had strong signal in both lateral and transverse sinus and their image was considered as normal. The other eight patients showed filling defects on the transverse sinus (focal unilateral narrowing in four cases, one or more signal gaps in four cases).

   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of signal gaps in the venous sinus (stenosis/hypoplasia or absence of signal) is a frequent finding in patients with PC. That is why we have concluded that this test is important in patients with PC in order to search for a possible etiology and treatment option.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To make a retrospective study of the clinical, etiological, diagnostic and prognostic features of cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis (CVST) diagnosed at our University Hospital.

   METHODS: We performed a systematic research of the clinical records of our University Hospital's electronic database (1977-2009) using the key words <<cerebral vein or sinus thrombosis>>.

   RESULTS: Ninety-five possible cases were found, and 16 were excluded due to alternative or uncertain diagnosis. Seventy-nine patients (43 females), median age of 46 years (2-82), were studied. Hereditary or acquired thrombophilia was detected in 22 patients (27.8%): prothrombin G20210A mutation (10), factor V Leyden (3), protein C deficiency (2), homozygous MTHFR C677T mutation (1), antiphospholipid syndrome (7) and hematological conditions (3). CVST was associated with infection in 17 cases, intracranial neoplasm in 9, malignancy in 13, treatment with prothrombotic drugs in 20 (including substitutive/antineoplastic hormones and oral contraceptives) and other causes in 8. Thirteen cases were idiopathic. Clinical presentation was intracranial hypertension in 83.5%, focal deficits in 45.6% and seizures in 12.6 %. Transverse (57%) and superior sagittal sinus (49.4%) were the most commonly involved. Seizures occurred in 25.3%, venous infarction in 41% and severe intracranial hypertension in 22.8 %. Up to 31.6 % required surgical drainage, decompressive craniectomy or ventricular drainage. Nine cases associated peripheral venous thromboembolism and 4 CVST recurred. Evolution was favorable (modified Rankin scale 0-2 at 3 months) in 74.7%. Mortality rate was 13.9% (11 patients). Neoplastic and infectious origin was significantly associated with mortality and disability.

   CONCLUSION: We describe a large retrospective series of CVST where infectious and neoplastic etiologies were linked to an unfavorable outcome.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare clinicopathological entity. The incidence of CVST in children and neonates has been reported to be as high as 7 cases per million people, whereas in adults the incidence is 3-4 cases per million. The predisposing factors to this condition are mainly genetic and acquired prothrombotic states and infection. The clinical picture of CVST is nonspecific, highly variable, and can mimic several other clinical conditions. Diagnosis of CVST is established with the implementation of neuroimaging studies, especially MR imaging and venography. Identification and elimination of the underlying cause, anticoagulation, proper management of intracranial hypertension, and anticonvulsant prophylaxis constitute cornerstones of CVST treatment. Newer treatment strategies such as endovascular thrombolysis and decompressive craniectomy have been recently used in the treatment of patients with CVST with variable success rates. Further clinical research must be performed to delineate the exact role of these newer treatments in the management of severe cases of CVST. The recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CVST have significantly lowered the associated mortality and morbidity and have improved the outcome of these patients.

Abstract
  Although intracranial hypertension may arise from diverse pathology, several basic principles remain paramount to understanding its dynamics; however, the management of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) may be very complex. Initial management of common ICP exacerbants is important, such as addressing venous outflow obstruction with upright midline head positioning and treating agitation and pain with sedation and analgesia. Surgical decompression of mass effect may rapidly improve ICP elevation, but the impact on outcome is unclear. Considerable effort has been put forth to understand the roles of multimodal intensive care monitoring, osmolar therapy, cerebral metabolic suppression, and temperature augmentation in the advanced management of elevated ICP. Establishing a protocol-driven approach to the management of ICP enables the rapid bedside assessment of multiple physiologic variables to implement appropriate treatments, which limit the risk of developing secondary brain injury.

Abstract
  It has been postulated that cerebral venous outflow "obstruction" is a precipitating factor for many cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We describe a 17-year-old woman with IIH, and "venous obstruction" repeatedly demonstrated on magnetic resonance venography (MRV) that within minutes resolved partially when the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was reduced to 11 cmH(2)O and completely when the pressure was reduced to 8cmH(2)O. These findings further support the view that raised pressure is the cause of the "obstruction", rather than the obstruction being the primary cause of the IIH. It also raises questions about how low the CSF pressure should be reduced at therapeutic lumbar puncture.

Abstract
  Patients undergoing bi-directional Glenn shunt for various congenital anomalies of the heart will have their superior vena cava (SVC) clamped during the procedure. The duration of the procedure is variable, ranging from five to 30 minutes. This can affect the cerebral perfusion due to raised venous pressure [Cerebral blood flow = Mean arterial pressure-(Intracranial pressure + Central venous pressure)]. Shunting away the SVC blood is a well known technique to counter this problem, but we describe two cases where a novel technique was successfully used to decompress the SVC.

Abstract
  The alterations of the cerebral venous circulation are a rare but clinically important cause of headache. Although any process involving the cerebral veins or sinuses may cause headache, the most frequent and important are cerebral venous thrombosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The headache of cerebral venous thrombosis does not have specific features and may be isolated; therefore, all patients with headache and risk factors for venous thrombosis should undergo the appropriate neuroradiologic examinations to rule out the diagnosis. In fact, early anticoagulant treatment may dramatically change the clinical outcome. Also idiopathic intracranial hypertension, if untreated, may have serious clinical consequences such as permanent visual loss. The pathogenesis of this disorder has not been clearly established and several possibilities involving the cerebral circulation are discussed.

Abstract
  The function of the brain is not checkable in comatose or sedated patients. Because secondary brain damage will often cause brain edema it is necessary to recognize the resulting increases in brain pressure. Therefore, measurement of intracranial brain pressure (ICP) is the standard monitoring procedure in neurological intensive care. The procedure with a small drill hole trepanation and the insertion of a micropressure sensor has a comparatively low complication rate and offers continuous monitoring with reliable values. Other neuro-monitoring procedures have not achieved the value of ICP measurement and only reflect changes in ICP with other measurement principles. ICP measurement is the procedure which is decisive for conservative measures in the intensive care unit to secure cerebral perfusion or indications for surgical treatment of brain edema. Central venous pressure, intra-abdominal pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure do not have a substantial influence on ICP. [References: 25]

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The impact of osmotic therapies on brain oxygen has not been extensively studied in humans. We examined the effects on brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO(2)) of mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and refractory intracranial hypertension.

   METHODS: 12 consecutive patients with severe TBI who underwent intracranial pressure (ICP) and PbtO(2) monitoring were studied. Patients were treated with mannitol (25%, 0.75 g/kg) for episodes of elevated ICP (>20 mm Hg) or HTS (7.5%, 250 ml) if ICP was not controlled with mannitol. PbtO(2), ICP, mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), central venous pressure and cardiac output were monitored continuously.

   RESULTS: 42 episodes of intracranial hypertension, treated with mannitol (n = 28 boluses) or HTS (n = 14 boluses), were analysed. HTS treatment was associated with an increase in PbtO(2) (from baseline 28.3 (13.8) mm Hg to 34.9 (18.2) mm Hg at 30 min, 37.0 (17.6) mm Hg at 60 min and 41.4 (17.7) mm Hg at 120 min; all p<0.01) while mannitol did not affect PbtO(2) (baseline 30.4 (11.4) vs 28.7 (13.5) vs 28.4 (10.6) vs 27.5 (9.9) mm Hg; all p>0.1). Compared with mannitol, HTS was associated with lower ICP and higher CPP and cardiac output.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe TBI and elevated ICP refractory to previous mannitol treatment, 7.5% hypertonic saline administered as second tier therapy is associated with a significant increase in brain oxygenation, and improved cerebral and systemic haemodynamics.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Intracranial electrode monitoring is still required in epilepsy surgery; however, it is associated with significant morbidity.

   OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with complications during invasive intracranial EEG monitoring.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of all patients undergoing invasive monitoring at Westmead between 1988-2004. From detailed chart reviews, the following variables were recorded: duration of intracranial monitoring, the site of grid implantation, number of grids and electrodes, seizure frequency, postoperative complications and seizure outcome.

   RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (median age: 24 years) underwent subdural electrode implantation; 62% had extratemporal lobe epilepsy and 46% were non-lesional. Of the 58 monitored patients who had cortical resections, 45 had good seizure outcomes. Complications related to subdural electrode implantation included transient complications requiring no treatment (12.7%), transient complications requiring treatment (9.9%) and two deaths (2.8%). Specific complications included subdural haemorrhage, transient neurological deficit, infarction and osteomyelitis. The two deaths occurred within 48 h of implantation were related to raised intracranial pressure (one venous infarction, one unexplained). Complications were associated with maximal size of grid (p < 0.001), greater number of electrodes (p < 0.001), electrode density per cortical surface implanted (p < 0.001), right central surface implantation (p = 0.003) and left central surface implantation (p = 0.013). Multiple logistic regression identified larger size grids and right central surface implantation as independent predictors of complications.

   CONCLUSION: There are significant complications during intracranial EEG evaluations but the majority of these are transient. We found a relationship between the size of the electrode arrays and the incidence of complications. The results of this study have been used to modify our implantation and monitoring protocols.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes such as vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and trauma, or Call-Fleming syndrome are difficult to treat, and can lead to substantial disability and death. Dantrolene, a ryanodine receptor antagonist, inhibits intracellular calcium release from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum. We examined the effect of dantrolene on middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocities as measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD).

   METHODS: Three consecutive patients with elevated MCA TCD velocities receiving dantrolene (2.5 mg/kg i.v. q6h) were retrospectively reviewed. Average MCA peak systolic, mean flow velocities, and the pulsatility index (PI) before and after the dantrolene infusion were compared within patients. Systemic physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, body temperature, and cooling water temperature) were retrospectively collected 6 h before and after the dantrolene infusion.

   RESULTS: MCA peak systolic velocities (mean +/- SE) for the three patients were 297 +/- 3, 248 +/- 8, and 268 +/- 19 cm/s before dantrolene and 159 +/- 9, 169 +/- 8, and 216 +/- 12 cm/s after dantrolene. Average mean flow velocities showed the same trend. Interestingly, the PI increased slightly from 0.6, 0.52, and 0.67 before dantrolene, to 1.17, 0.71, and 0.77 after dantrolene. Systemic physiological parameters remained stable in all three patients.

   CONCLUSION: Dantrolene attenuated cerebral vasoconstriction as measured by TCD without altering systemic physiological parameters. This suggests that intracellular calcium release from ryanodine channels in smooth muscle might play a role in vasospasm. A prospective study is underway to test this hypothesis.

Abstract
  To review the literature on the surgical treatment of idiopathic pseudotumour cerebri (PTC) [idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)]. When medical therapy fails or when visual dysfunction deteriorates, surgical therapies for PTC should be considered. The main procedures performed include lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) and optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF). Recently, venous sinus stenting procedures have been performed on selected patients with PTC, especially those with venous sinus occlusive disease. The literature is summarized and appraised in the form of a narrative review. It is evident that ONSF, LPS, VPS and, in selected cases, venous sinus stenting may improve vision and prevent deterioration of vision in patients with PTC. All of the procedures have their advantages and disadvantages and may fail with time no matter what procedure is used. Various authorities have vehemently advocated one or the other of these procedures. Until a prospective, randomized study comparing ONSF with LPS or VPS for PTC is performed, and until the role of venous sinus obstruction as the aetiology of PTC is better defined, the question of which surgical procedure is best for the treatment of PTC remains unanswered.

Abstract
  OBJECT: Inappropriate sudden blood pressure (BP) reductions may adversely affect cerebral perfusion. This study explores the effect of nicardipine on regional brain tissue O(2) (PbtO(2)) during treatment of acute hypertensive emergencies.

   METHODS: A prospective case-control study was performed in 30 patients with neurological conditions and clinically elevated BP. All patients had a parenchymal PbtO(2) and intracranial pressure bolt inserted following resuscitation. Using a critical care guide, PbtO(2) was optimized. Intravenous nicardipine (5-15 mg/hour) was titrated to systolic BP < 160 mm Hg, diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg, mean arterial BP (MABP) 90-110 mm Hg, and PbtO(2) > 20 mm Hg. Physiological parameters-intracranial pressure, PbtO(2), central venous pressure, systolic BP, diastolic BP, MABP, fraction of inspired O(2), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)-were compared before infusion, at 4 hours, and at 8 hours using a t-test.

   RESULTS: Sixty episodes of hypertension were reported in 30 patients (traumatic brain injury in 13 patients; aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in 11; intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage in 3 and 1, respectively; arteriovenous malformation in 1; and hypoxic brain injury in 1). Nicardipine was effective in 87% of the patients (with intravenous beta blockers in 4 patients), with a 19.7% reduction in mean 4-hour MABP (115.3 +/- 13.1 mm Hg preinfusion vs 92.9 +/- 11.40 mm Hg after 4 hours of therapy, p < 0.001). No deleterious effect on mean PbtO(2) was recorded (26.74 +/- 15.42 mm Hg preinfusion vs 27.68 +/- 12.51 mm Hg after 4 hours of therapy, p = 0.883) despite significant reduction in CPP. Less dependence on normobaric hyperoxia was achieved at 8 hours (0.72 +/- 0.289 mm Hg preinfusion vs 0.626 +/- 0.286 mm Hg after 8 hours of therapy, p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed that 12 patients had low pretreatment PbtO(2) (10.30 +/- 6.49 mm Hg), with higher CPP (p < 0.001) requiring hyperoxia (p = 0.02). In this group, intravenous nicardipine resulted in an 83% improvement in 4- and 8-hour PbtO(2) levels (18.1 +/- 11.33 and 19.59 +/- 23.68 mm Hg, respectively; p < 0.01) despite significant reductions in both mean MABP (120.6 +/- 16.65 vs 95.8 +/- 8.3 mm Hg, p < 0.001) and CPP (105.00 +/- 20.7 vs 81.2 +/- 15.4 mm Hg, p < 0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous nicardipine is effective for the treatment of hypertensive neurological emergencies and has no adverse effect on PbtO(2).

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We developed a comprehensive cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure model to simulate and study the complex interactions in cerebrovascular dynamics caused by multiple simultaneous alterations, including normal and abnormal functional states of autoregulation of the brain.

   METHODS: Individual published equations (derived from prior animal and human studies) were implemented into a comprehensive simulation program. Included in the normal physiological modeling was cerebral blood flow, arterial blood pressure, and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) partial pressure. We also added external and pathological perturbations, such as head-up position and intracranial hemorrhage.

   RESULTS: The model performed clinically realistically given inputs of published traumatized patients and cases encountered by clinicians. The pulsatile nature of the output graphics was easy for clinicians to interpret. The maneuvers simulated include changes of basic physiological inputs (e.g., arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, CO(2) tension, head-up position, and respiratory effects on vascular pressures) as well as pathological inputs (e.g., acute intracranial bleeding, and obstruction of cerebrospinal outflow).

   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, we believe the model would be useful to teach complex relationships of brain hemodynamics and study clinical research questions such as the optimal head-up position, the effects of intracranial hemorrhage on cerebral hemodynamics, as well as the best CO(2) concentration, to reach the optimal compromise between intracranial pressure and perfusion. With the ability to vary the model's complexity, we believe it would be useful for both beginners and advanced learners. The model could also be used by practicing clinicians to model individual patients (entering the effects of needed clinical manipulations and then running the model to test for optimal combinations of therapeutic maneuvers).

Abstract
  Neuroimaging is useful in benign intracranial hypertension (BIH), contributing to its diagnosis criteria and ruling out other causes of intracranial hypertension. CT and/or MR results may be normal or may show small ventricles, an empty sella, or more frequently optic nerve sheath dilatation. Diffusion as well as perfusion MR studies show conflicting results. Venous sinus imaging plays a growing role in BIH evaluation, because impaired cranial venous outflow is a common factor in the pathogenesis of BIH and venous sinus stenosis is frequently observed in this condition. Angiography is not the gold standard for this evaluation: angio-MR (with dynamic sequences) clearly demonstrates venous sinus stenosis (mostly located in the transverse sinus). We believe that this investigation must be carried out in every case of BIH. For medically refractory cases of BIH with associated sinus venous stenosis, sinus pressure recording may be necessary, sometimes leading to endovascular treatment of the stenosis (stenting). The results are promising, but long-term follow-up of these patients is needed.

Abstract
  Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is a rare condition in which the pathophysiology remains unclear. Multiple theories have been proposed in the past to explain BIH. Today it is widely accepted that the condition occurs in situations where alteration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reabsorption is encountered. The venous system is therefore involved and may be the common denominator of the pathophysiological theories. A distinction must be made between idiopathic benign intracranial hypertension and BIH resulting from drugs, other pathological conditions, or toxics (secondary BIH), which are reported in this paper. We emphasize the crucial role of exhaustive clinical, biological, and neuroradiological investigations aiming to establish the diagnosis of BIH.

Abstract
  Quick and reliable setting of programmable pressure valves (PPVs) is important in the treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), especially for reducing overdrainage complications and related medical costs. A new quick reference table (QRT) was developed for improved PPV control and outcome. Shunt control can be based on the pressure environment in the sitting condition, given as hydrostatic pressure (HP) = intracranial pressure + PPV setting + intraabdominal pressure (IAP). Using this relationship, and estimating HP and IAP from the patient's height and body mass index, respectively, a QRT was designed, consisting of a matrix of the patient's height and weight. The QRT was used to make initial PPV settings in 25 patients with iNPH and the clinical outcomes were evaluated. Postoperative readjustments of the PPV were not necessary in 15 of the 25 patients. At 1 month after operation, the PPV setting was decreased once in 5 patients and increased once in 2 patients. Four of these 7 patients improved after a single readjustment. Three patients required further readjustments. At 3 months after operation, another 3 patients required a single readjustment and all improved after this readjustment. The readjustment rate was 40% and readjustment number was 0.68 times/patient. The mean PPV setting at 1 year after operation was 15.5 +/- 3.9 cmH(2)O. Use of the QRT in non-bedridden iNPH patients results in a low incidence of PPV readjustment.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of lung recruitment maneuver (RM) on intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP).

   METHODS: RM was performed and ICP, MAP, central venous pressure (CVP), saturation of arterial oxygen (SpO2) were monitored continuously in 6 severe cerebral injury patients combined with lung injury, who were indicated for mechanical ventilation and meeting the criteria for intracranial pressure monitoring. RM included pressure control ventilation with stepwise increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

   RESULTS: RM was performed for 22 times in 6 patients, among them two were moribund due to sharp drop of blood pressure and CPP. In the remaining 20 attempts, the mean values of MAP, CVP, ICP, CPP measured at each PEEP level showed no significant difference compared with baseline values (all P>0.05). MAP was significantly correlated with CPP (r=0.706, P=0.000). In the remaining RMs, a correlation between MAP and CPP accounted for 85% (17/20) of total RMs, that between PEEP and CVP accounted for 75% (15/20), that between PEEP and ICP accounted for 75% (15/20), and that between PEEP and CPP existed in 40% (8/20). In a total of 22 cases, there were 6 patterns of response of MAP to alteration in PEEP: MAP maintained relatively stable in 8 case, MAP decreased when PEEP increased and increased when PEEP decreased in 6 case; in 2 cases MAP elevated with increase in PEEP, and drop to baseline with decrease in PEEP, in 2 cases it fell with increase in PEEP but it did not rise with decrease in PEEP, in 2 cases it rose with increase in PEEP but remained at a high level with PEEP decreased to baseline, in 2 cases, MAP dropped abruptly with increase in PEEP resulting in termination of RM. In 11 cases, ICP increased with increase in PEEP and decreased with lowering of PEEP. ICP maintained stable in 6 cases, and ICP maintained at a high level and did not return to baseline after RM in 3 cases. CPP decreased with increase in PEEP and increased when PEEP decreased, and it returned to baseline when PEEP was back to baseline in 12 case. CPP kept constant in 6 case. In 2 cases, CPP remained at a low level, and it returned to baseline 10-20 minutes after PEEP was lowered to baseline.

   CONCLUSION: There is considerable individual difference in impact of RM on MAP, ICP and CPP in patients with cerebral. ICP monitoring is helpful to assure safety of RM in patients with cerebral injury complicated with lung injury.

Abstract
  A 41-year-old male is admitted for cranial trauma, having fallen from his own height. His state of extreme agitation imposes sedation, intubation and mechanical ventilation. A CT-scan reveals acute right hemispheric subdural haematoma, with discrete midline shift, and diffuse cerebral oedema. ICP-monitoring reveals severely increased intracranial pressure, which is responsive to routine medical neuroprotective treatment. Ten days after admission, sedation and neuroprotective treatment is gradually withdrawn. At the end of the second week, a secondary ascent in ICP is observed. The presence of a right subclavian central venous line, in combination with the strong inflammatory response and septic state of the patient, has caused bilateral thrombosis of subclavian and internal jugular veins. This superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) impedes cerebral venous drainage, thus raising ICP. Within a few days of anticoagulant therapy, SVCS resolved. Impeded cerebral venous drainage is often forgotten or ignored as a cause of secondary elevated ICP. In face of persisting or recurring raised ICP and cerebral oedema, or apparition of communicant hydrocephalus, cerebral venous drainage should be investigated.

Abstract
  Only 10 years ago, a review of the use of stents to treat cerebrovascular disease would have resulted in a limited report. Currently, however, stents increasingly are used in clinical practice, and this trend is expected to grow exponentially as a result of constant technologic improvements and refinements and cross-fertilization from several fields of medicine, science, technology, business, and industry. Cerebrovascular conditions, which so far have been demonstrated to, and may benefit from the use of stents, include atheromatous disease, broad-based cerebral aneurysms, arterial dissections, and venous occlusive disease causing increased intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are abnormal connections between the dural arteries and dural veins in the cranial dura mater. These fistulas involve the cavernous sinus, transverse-sigmoid sinus, superior sagittal sinus, inferior/superior petrosal sinus, sphenoparietal sinus, anterior cranial base, tentorium, craniocervical junction, and anterior condylar confluence. Presently, there are several classifications according to the venous restrictive condition. These classifications are useful in both determining the hemodynamic status of the patient and in formulating treatment strategies. The clinical signs and symptoms of these fistulas essentially result from hypertensive venopathy with or without venous hemorrhages. Patients with aggressive course are characterized by retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage and veneous restrictive lesions. Besides location specific symptoms, intracranial venous hypertension is a key mechanism mimicking benign intracranial hypertension. Angiographic evaluation of the impairment in cerebral venous drainage is important as well as evaluating the angioanatomical features of the feeding and draining vessels and of the fistula sites. The characteristic findings of modern diagnostic tools such as CT scan, MRI, and conventional angiography are also described in this study. [References: 27]

Abstract
  Oxidative mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain edema in acute liver failure (ALF). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that inhibition of iron-catalyzed oxidative reactions through iron chelation using deferoxamine could attenuate brain edema in a swine model of ischemic ALF. Following ALF induction (end-to-side portacaval anastomosis and ligation of the hepatoduodenal ligament), 14 animals were randomized to a study group that received an intravenous infusion of 150 mg/kg deferoxamine (group DF; n = 7) or a control group (group C; n = 7). Six sham-operated animals were also assigned to a deferoxamine-treated group (n = 3) or a control group (n = 3). Hemodynamic, neurological, and hematological parameters were monitored postoperatively. All sham animals maintained normal hemodynamics and intracranial pressure. At 18 hours, group DF animals had higher mean arterial pressure (mean +/- standard deviation: 98.0 +/- 15.9 versus 69.9 +/- 15.8 mmHg, P < 0.004), lower intracranial pressure (18.1 +/- 8.6 versus 32.7 +/- 13.4 mmHg, P < 0.032), and higher cerebral perfusion pressure (76.4 +/- 16.4 versus 37.1 +/- 25.6 mmHg, P < 0.006) in comparison with group C. Similar differences were recorded up to the 24th postoperative hour, leading to a significant difference in animal survival (88% in group DF versus 17% in group C, P < 0.001). Furthermore, group DF exhibited an attenuated increase of serum malondialdehyde from the baseline (16% versus 74%, P < 0.05) and lower brain malondialdehyde concentrations (3.7 +/- 1.3 versus 5.7 +/- 2.0 microM/mg of protein, P < 0.05) in comparison with controls. In conclusion, deferoxamine delayed the development of intracranial hypertension and improved survival in pigs with ischemic ALF.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Venous hypertension is emerging as a significant contributor to intracranial pressure in children with syndromic craniosysnostosis. This is associated with jugular foramen stenosis or atresia and with the development of collateral emissary veins. We demonstrate how computed tomography venography can document the prevalence of these emissary veins and how their visualisation plays an important role in operative planning.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with known syndromic craniosynostosis underwent computed tomography venography as part of their routine pre-operative evaluation. The venous drainage pattern was examined in these patients, with a special note of the presence of abnormal venous pathways.

   RESULTS: Eleven patients were recruited into the study from ages 3 months to 22 years. All had a diagnosis of syndromic craniosynostosis with six Crouzon's, four Pfeiffer's and one patient with Crouzon's and acanthosis nigricans. Nine of 11 patients had demonstrable evidences of transosseous venous drainage through an identifiable abnormal emissary vein. Four of 11 had a transosseous route as the main mechanism of drainage for the cerebral venous system.

   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis often demonstrate abnormal venous anatomy, which can have serious consequences on craniofacial surgery, especially when a posterior decompression is being considered. Based on these findings, the authors assert that those children with some syndromic craniosynostosis being considered for surgery should undergo venographic studies as part of their pre-operative evaluation.

Abstract
  AIM: To investigate the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese traditional medicines Da Cheng Qi Decoction (Timely-Purging and Yin-Preserving Decoction) and Glauber's salt combined with conservative measures on abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients.

   METHODS: Eighty consecutive SAP patients, admitted for routine non-operative conservative treatment, were randomly divided into study group and control group (40 patients in each group). Patients in the study group received Da Cheng Qi Decoction enema for 2 h and external use of Glauber's salt, once a day for 7 d. Patients in the control group received normal saline (NS) enema. Routine non-operative conservative treatments included non-per os nutrition (NPON), gastrointestinal decompression, life support, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), continuous peripancreatic vascular pharmaceutical infusion and drug therapy. Intra-cystic pressure (ICP) of the two groups was measured during treatment. The effectiveness and outcomes of treatment were observed and APACHE II scores were applied in analysis.

   RESULTS: On days 4 and 5 of treatment, the ICP was lower in the study group than in the control group (P < 0.05). On days 3-5 of treatment, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores for the study and control groups were significantly different (P < 0.05). Both the effectiveness and outcome of the treatment with Da Cheng Qi Decoction on abdominalgia, burbulence relief time, ascites quantity, cyst formation rate and hospitalization time were quite different between the two groups (P < 0.05). The mortality rate for the two groups had no significant difference.

   CONCLUSION: Da Cheng Qi Decoction enema and external use of Glauber's salt combined with routine non-operative conservative treatment can decrease the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of SAP patients and have preventive and therapeutic effects on abdominal compartment syndrome of SAP.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: There are many systemic illnesses that constitute risk factors for cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT). Hypothyroidism was never associated with CVT, despite growing evidence supporting a possible etiopathogenic link. We report two patients with CVT in whom hypothyroidism was concomitantly diagnosed.

   CLINICAL CASES: Cases were women 21 and 52 years old. They both presented with intracranial hypertension syndrome and symptomatic focal epilepsy. CVT was diagnosed with MRI and MR venography. Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in the acute phase of CVT. Both had an autoimmune thyroiditis. None of the patients had diffuse goitre. Other risk factors for CVT were oral contraceptives and elevated homocysteine in one and hormonal replacement therapy in the other. Both were treated with anticoagulation, anti-epileptic drugs and thyroid replacement therapy, with good clinical outcome.

   CONCLUSIONS: The association found between untreated hypothyroidism and CVT in these patients may result from chance. However, several haemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters have been demonstrated to be disturbed in hypothyroidism suggesting a possible role of this disease in CVT pathogenesis. In addition, indirect evidence also supports possible endothelial dysfunction and venous stasis in hypothyroidism, further emphasizing the physiopathological link between the two conditions. More research is needed to determine a possible causal role of hypothyroidism on CVT. We suggest that thyroid function should be included in the usual workup of CVT patients.

Abstract
  Intra-abdominal hypertension causes many physiologic changes, primarily by reducing thoracic compliance and secondarily causing organ failure, which is the body's normal response to trauma or acute inflammatory response. Compartment syndrome as a cause of abdominal hypertension has adverse effects on the circulation, threatening the function and viability of tissues. Intra-abdominal hypertension with the clinical picture of compartment syndrome is a reperfusion injury that is a cyclic event. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure due to whatever mechanism affects all intra-abdominal viscera, including the abdominal wall. Due to edema reducing thoracic compliance, producing severe encephalopathy and leading to severe ischemia with generation of significant quantities of reactive oxygen free radicals as well peroxidation products released from the intestine, liver and spleen. Elevated intracranial pressure causes encephalopathy and the risk of neuronal damage due to the sharp decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. Elevated intracranial pressure is due to restriction of outflow from the lumbar venous plexus. The etiology of the sudden increase in capillary permeability remains unclear. Decompressive laparotomy leads to a rapid improvement in pulmonary parameters and oxygen delivery. The clinical state after decompression is an example of ischemia-reperfusion injury requiring therapy with inotropes and other agents to improve cardiac, respiratory, renal and cerebral hemodynamics with life saving effects.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is responsible for causing most nervous system diseases to progress seriously, till death. Recently, volume-targeted therapeutic strategy against increased ICP, which works by releasing excessive intracranial liquid especially from the venous compartment, attracted a great deal of attention. Previous research by us found a structurally special "outflow segment cuff" that is located at the juncture of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the brain-bridging veins in porcine model. Sequential observation demonstrated that this special structure appeared to have functional abnormalities. Based on these findings, it was proposed to try and prove a further hypothesis that there exists a similar structure in human beings that might be of importance for cerebral venous system to intervene in volume-initiated ICP regulation. Meanwhile, the diameters of bridging veins under either increased or normal ICP are compared by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

   METHOD: Forty patients who presented with increased ICP were selected to undergo 2D time of flight (TOF) venography and ten normal volunteers were taken as the control group. Increased intracranial pressure status was evaluated by using flash visual evoked potential (fVEP) technique. All the patients and volunteers underwent 2D-TOF MRI imaging for the following parameters: repetition time/echo time, 50/4.9 milliseconds; flip angle, 45 degrees ; field of view, 250x250 mm; matrix, 256x256 pixels; section thickness, 1.5 mm. Syngo fastview imaging system was used to process and analyze the targeted brain-bridging venous section.

   RESULTS: By using 2D-TOF method in vivo, most bridging venous profiles as well as SSS and vicinal cortical veins could be clearly visualized. A short and narrow section, as previously described, obviously emerged because of MRI signal weakness even disappearing at the juncture of SSS and bridging veins in increased ICP patients. In combination with previous animal morphological findings we believe that this section with abnormal MRI signal could stand for the human counterpart of "outflow segment cuff" in porcine. Such a special structure could be observed within a majority of increased ICP patients (32/40 cases), whereas only one case presented the existence of similar imaging signal weakness. Furthermore, the diameters of the bridging veins in increased ICP group are statistically larger than the control group.

   CONCLUSION: Intracranial venous compartment occupies about 70 to 80% blood volume inside the inflexible cranial cavity. Following volume-targeted rationale, ICP can be regulated effectively by the fluctuation of venous blood volume based on different aspects of morphology, biomechanics, and hemodynamics. In the present study, the coincidence of animal model and human venography in vivo offers strong evidences to support the hypothesis that venous hemodynamics, although passively, influences intracranial pressure environment through a possible key regulator - outflow segment narrow structure. The fact that this narrow formation and proximal vascular dilation appears more in patients under high ICP condition rather than in patients with normal pressure. Both narrow formation and proximal vascular dilation indicate its significant contribution to intracranial venous congestion, resulting from difficult drainage and the close relationship between intracranial venous volume and ICP.

Abstract
  Benign intracranial hypertension is a clinical diagnosis linked to a number of medical and surgical disorders. A common aetiology has not yet been established. It would seem, however, that many, if not all, of these cases can be related to some degree of cerebral venous outflow obstruction. We present here a series of patients with extraluminal compression of the cerebral venous sinuses that has been amenable to surgical resection. These 'surgical' causes of BIH illustrate an important subset of the disease and inform us about the possible pathophysiological principles underlying the disorder.

Abstract
  The management of critically ill children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) requires a precise assessment of the brain lesions but also of potentially associated extra-cranial injuries. Children with severe TBI should be treated in a pediatric trauma center, if possible. Initial assessment relies mainly upon clinical examination, trans-cranial Doppler ultrasonography and body CT scan. Neurosurgical operations are rarely necessary in these patients, except in the case of a compressive subdural or epidural hematoma. On the other hand, one of the major goals of resuscitation in these children is aimed at protecting against secondary brain insults (SBI). SBI are mainly because of systemic hypotension, hypoxia, hypercarbia, anemia and hyperglycemia. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = mean arterial blood pressure - intracranial pressure: ICP) should be monitored and optimized as soon as possible, taking into account age-related differences in optimal CPP goals. Different general maneuvers must be applied in these patients early during their treatment (control of fever, avoidance of jugular venous outflow obstruction, maintenance of adequate arterial oxygenation, normocarbia, sedation-analgesia and normovolemia). In the case of increased ICP and/or decreased CPP, first-tier ICP-specific treatments may be implemented, including cerebrospinal fluid drainage, if possible, osmotic therapy and moderate hyperventilation. In the case of refractory intracranial hypertension, second-tier therapy (profound hyperventilation with P(a)CO(2) < 35 mmHg, high-dose barbiturates, moderate hypothermia, decompressive craniectomy) may be introduced, after a new cerebral CT scan.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To explore the relation between venous disease and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

   BACKGROUND: Optic nerve sheath fenestration and ventricular shunting are the classic methods when medical treatment has failed. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is caused by venous sinus obstruction in an unknown percentage of cases. Recently, endoluminal venous sinus stenting was proposed as an alternative treatment.

   METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension underwent examination with direct retrograde cerebral venography and manometry to characterize the morphologic features and venous pressures in their cerebral venous sinus. All patients demonstrated morphologic obstruction of the venous lateral sinuses. The CSF pressure was measured in all patients. The CSF pressure on lumbar puncture ranged from 27 to 45 mm Hg with normal composition. All patients had headache, and visual acuity loss was noted in eight patients. Funduscopic examination demonstrated papilledema for all patients. All patients had stenting of the venous sinuses. Intrasinus pressures were recorded before and after the procedure and correlated with clinical outcome.

   RESULTS: Intrasinus pressures were invariably reduced by stenting. For headache, six patients were rendered asymptomatic, two were improved, and two were unchanged after venous sinus stenting for a mean (+/- SD) follow-up of 17 +/- 10.1 months (range 6 to 36 months). Papilledema disappeared in all patients. In all cases, CSF pressure was normalized at 3-month follow-up. In all patients, direct retrograde cerebral venography or multidetector row CT angiography was performed at 6-month follow-up and demonstrated the absence of stent thrombosis.

   CONCLUSION: The importance of venous sinus disease in the etiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is probably underestimated. Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension in whom a venous sinus stenosis is demonstrated by a noninvasive radiologic workup should be evaluated with direct retrograde cerebral venography and manometry. In patients with a lesion of the venous sinuses who experienced medical treatment failure, endovascular stent placement seems to be an interesting alternative to classic surgical approaches.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Since a direct non-invasive measurement of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is not available, it was the purpose of the study to describe the non-invasive determination of the central retinal vein pressure as an estimate of an elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure.

   METHODS: A 28-year-old female patient with blurred vision, nuchal pain and prominent optic discs underwent modified ophthalmodynamometry to determine the central retinal vein pressure as surrogate of the intracranial pressure. A Goldmann contact lens with a pressure sensor mounted into its holding ring was placed onto the cornea. Pressure was applied to the globe by slightly pressing the contact lens until the central retinal vein started to pulsate/collapse.

   RESULTS: Despite an abnormally high central retinal vein pressure (OD: 17 arbitrary units; OS: 33 arbitrary units), the neurological examination including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was unremarkable on the first day. A lumbar puncture revealed a cerebrospinal fluid pressure of 25 cm H(2)O, which was at the upper limit of the normal range. Over the next 2 days, ophthalmodynamometry showed increasing measurements of the central retinal vein pressure for both eyes, parallel to elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurements by lumbar puncture, leading to the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. After treatment, the cerebrospinal fluid pressure returned to normal levels, parallel to a decrease in the central retinal vein pressure as determined by ophthalmodynamometry.

   CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmodynamometry of the central retinal vein was helpful in the diagnosis of an elevated intracranial pressure, with direct lumbar pressure measurement running parallel to the ophthalmodynamometric measurements.

Abstract
  In trauma practice, basilar skull fracture is an extremely common finding while transverse/sigmoid venous sinus thrombosis is generally considered quite a rare complication. During evaluation of cervical computed tomography (CT) angiography after trauma, we identified five patients in just three months with unexpected transverse/sigmoid venous sinus obstruction ipsilateral to a basilar skull fracture. This number represented a surprisingly high percentage of our neurosurgical trauma consults for the study period (31%). Three of the five patients were found to have sinus thrombosis: two with right transverse/sigmoid sinus thrombosis experienced significant neurological deficits and prolonged hospital courses even with anti-coagulation therapy; one patient with a left transverse/sigmoid sinus thrombosis had a good outcome with anti-coagulation therapy. The other two of the five patients had outflow obstruction, likely from focal epidural bleeding and extrinsic compression: one patient with partial obstruction in the right transverse-sigmoid junction, due to epidural bleeding, experienced a difficult recovery; one patient with a right sigmoid sinus obstruction presented and remained asymptomatic and experienced a benign hospital course. Two of the five patients had a posterior temporal hemorrhagic area ipsilateral to the affected sinus, suggesting that this finding may have represented hemorrhagic venous infarction rather than traumatic contusion. We propose that a basilar skull fracture in the region of temporal or occipital bone should be considered as a significant risk factor for the development of transverse/sigmoid venous sinus obstruction and may be an under-recognized and treatable cause of increased intracranial pressure. Failure to detect this complication may explain, in part, unexpected clinical outcomes.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The traditional management of hydrocephalus still is the placement of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. However, the majority of patients require one or more revisions over their lifetime. Revisions may be required for infections, proximal site malfunction, or distal catheter complications. The authors present their experience with distal catheter complications managed laparoscopically.

   METHODS: Patients with recurrent symptoms of increased intracranial pressure or abdominal complaints were evaluated for shunt malfunction. Similar radiographic imaging was performed for all the patients, including computed tomography (CT) of the head and abdomen, shunt series, and/or ultrasound of the distal catheter.

   RESULTS: From April 2003 to July 2005, 13 patients with distal VP shunt complications were managed laparoscopically. On the basis of preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, all the patients were determined not to have an infection. Radiographic imaging showed the patients to have distal catheter problems. Preoperatively, five abdominal CT scans, six shunt series, and four abdominal ultrasounds were obtained. All studies singly and positively identified the appropriate abdominal catheter defect except in three patients who required multiple sequential radiographic studies for final determination of the diagnosis. In four patients (30.8%), the distal catheter was found to be in the extraperitoneal space. Another four patients (30.8%) had intraabdominal CSF pseudocysts. Five patients (38.4%) had issues with the position of the intraabdominal catheter: four of them subdiaphragmatic and one on the dome of the bladder. Laparoscopic repositioning was successful for all 13 patients.

   CONCLUSION: Regardless of the patient's presenting symptoms, appropriate imaging studies should be obtained preoperatively in a sequential manner. Distal VP shunt complications can be safely and effectively managed laparoscopically. This approach allows the intraabdominal portion of the catheter to be assessed and problems to be managed, thereby salvaging the existing shunt and avoiding the potential morbidity associated with additional VP shunt placement.

Abstract
  It is hypothesised that the inflammatory condition seen in MS and the progressive myelopathy that is being successfully halted by obliteration of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs), may actually be two sides of the same coin. Excessive venous hypertension can stretch vein walls sufficiently to separate the tight junctions between endothelial cells forming the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Colloids, etc., but not necessarily erythrocytes, could then pass through the exposed porous basement membranes. The resulting changes in osmotic pressure, etc. would disrupt the axon and dendrite internal transport systems, leading to their disintegration. The normal inflammatory processes which would follow, might be indistinguishable from those associated with autoimmune disease. Ascending progressive myelopathy and disablement are associated with an intracranial DAVF when its outflow enters the spinal venous system and descends past the cervical region. This can be arrested, and some degree of recovery produced, if the DAVF can be successfully eliminated or blocked. However, if the DAVF outflow is entirely into the spine, intracranial venous pressure may be normal and so there is nothing to alert the clinician to the presence of an intracranial DAVF. It is suggested that where spinal MS has been diagnosed from clinical observations, patients should be referred for angiological investigation to search for DAVFs within the head to identify any treatable subjects.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rather rare disease which accounts for less than 1% of all strokes. Current therapeutic measures which are used in clinical practice include the use of anticoagulants such as dose-adjusted intravenous heparin or body weight-adjusted subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, the use of thrombolysis, and symptomatic therapy including control of seizures and elevated intracranial pressure. We reviewed the strength of evidence reported in the literature to support these interventions and provide treatment recommendations based on the best available evidence. Patients with CVST without contraindications for anticoagulation (AC) should be treated either with body weight-adjusted subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin or dose-adjusted intravenous heparin. Concomitant intracranial hemorrhage related to CVST is not a contraindication for heparin therapy. The optimal duration of oral AC after the acute phase is unclear. Oral AC may be given for 3 months if CVST was secondary to a transient risk factor, for 6-12 months in patients with idiopathic CVST and in those with 'mild' hereditary thrombophilia. Indefinite AC should be considered in patients with two or more episodes of CVST and in those with one episode of CVST and 'severe' hereditary thrombophilia. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either systemic or local thrombolysis in patients with CVST. If patients deteriorate despite adequate AC and other causes of deterioration have been ruled out, thrombolysis may be a therapeutic option in selected cases, possibly in those without intracranial hemorrhage. There are no controlled data about the risks and benefits of certain therapeutic measures to reduce an elevated intracranial pressure (with brain displacement) in patients with severe CVST. Anti-edema treatment (including hyperventilation, osmotic diuretics, craniectomy) should be used as life-saving interventions. [References: 27]

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Increased intra-abdominal pressure has been reported to result in raised intracranial pressure in a variety of conditions such as obesity and pregnancy, and it also constitutes an infrequent cause of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt malfunction. Patients with neurological deficits, as those with myelomeningocele or cerebral palsy, are prone to developing a neurogenic bowel and to suffer chronic constipation. Although previously recognized, VP shunt failure attributed to constipation has only recently been described. We briefly review the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and management of severe constipation leading to VP shunt malfunction. Our aim is to draw the attention of pediatric neurosurgeons towards severe constipation as a possible cause of VP shunt failure thus avoiding unnecessary surgical valve revisions, to which children with hydrocephalus are often submitted to.

   ILLUSTRATIVE CASES: We report two children that developed transient VP shunt failure because of intense constipation that caused exacerbation of previously shunted hydrocephalus. One of the patients constitutes the first description of this complication associated with an anteriorly placed anus and the other with intestinal paresis after ileostomy. Conservative treatment aimed at alleviating the increased intra-abdominal pressure resulted in complete resolution of the children's manifestations of VP shunt failure, without having to resort to surgical revision of the VP shunt.

Abstract
  Pressure in the central nervous system (CNS) depends upon the volume of tissue that it contains. This includes blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), nerves and any space occupying lesions. The dependency of pressure on volume arises because the CNS is confined by bone. Venous and CSF pressure is linked to overall pressure. Arterial pressure can increase in response to overall pressure to maintain arterial supply. Continuous arterial supply can be maintained because venous blood flows out of the CNS. Reduced volumes of arterial blood will enter the system if venous outflow is interrupted. Increase in CNS volume, as occurs with space occupying lesions, causes compression of veins. This may result in increased venous pressure and reduction in flow of blood out of the CNS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is extracellular fluid; its absorption back into the circulation is influenced by venous pressure. Any increased in CNS tissue volumes can therefore lead to CSF accumulation. This may then exacerbate the hydrocephalus by further increasing overall CNS volume. Free flow of CSF around the CNS facilitates venous drainage. Blockages to CSF flow can act like space occupying lesions. Chiari malformations, where the cerebellar tonsils obstruct the foramen magnum lead to reductions in CSF flow that can occur intermittently. This leads to impairment of venous drainage which may result in accumulation of CSF. The head or the spine can be affected together or separately. The manifestation of excess fluid accumulation is hydrocephalus and syringomyelia. The speed and origin of venous insufficiency influences the morphology of individual cases particularly with regard to lateral ventricle size. When pressure increases rapidly there may be little time for CSF accumulation. Oedema, compression of intracranial CSF spaces and cerebral ischaemia follows. When venous pressure is only slightly elevated CSF will accumulate and the manifestations of ischaemia may be less apparent, although ischaemia will be a feature of all instances of pathologically raised CNS pressure.

Abstract
  We report on management strategies and clinical outcomes in 4 cases of acute symptomatic congestive intracranial hypertension associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Congestion resulted from high-volume shunts exhausting the drainage capacity of the cerebral venous system in 3 patients, and from sudden venous outflow obstruction in 1 patient. Two AVMs were suggested to be surgically accessible, whereas two AVMs were deemed to be inoperable. Surgically accessible AVMs were treated with embolization followed by complete surgical resection. Inoperable AVMs were treated with partial embolization. Both AVM embolization followed by surgical resection and partial AVM embolization effectively reduced intracranial pressure and achieved sustained patient recovery. Hence, an endovascular approach may be considered to manage AVM-related congestive intracranial hypertension either in combination with surgical AVM removal, or as a palliative approach in inoperable AVMs. Copyright (c) 2007 S.

Abstract
  Vascular malformations of the ventricular system are rare, and their clinical and radiologic characteristics vary depending on the location of the lesions. Many types are described, but a comprehensive summary is lacking. Herein, we add two cases to the literature and review known types of ventricular vascular malformations. One case involved a 37-year-old woman who presented with headache due to hydrocephalus. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion of the foramen of Monro. The other case involved a 7-year-old boy who had dizziness and headache due to hydrocephalus. CT and MRI demonstrated a lesion of the third ventricle. In both cases, the images mimicked those of tumors with or without bleeding. As a result, the malformations were misdiagnosed, though surgical treatment was successful. In both cases, the lesions were proven to be arteriovenous malformations on pathologic evaluation. Correct diagnosis of ventricular vascular malformations is sometimes difficult but essential for good treatment planning. Their incidence is low. However, their bleeding and rebleeding rate is high, and they commonly cause hydrocephalus. Treatment should be timely and based on the type of lesion and its presentation.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Only minimal literature exists on consequences of shock wave therapy (SWT) on erectile function in treatment of Peyronie's disease (PD). This study was undertaken to define SWT impact at varied energy/dose levels at different time points on functional and structural changes in erectile tissue.

   METHODS: In 45 rats 2000 shock waves (sw) at 2 BAR were applied to the penis weekly sorted by one, two, and three sessions (high-dose/energy level, HD-1, HD-2, HD-3). Each group was followed for 1, 7, or 28 d before measuring intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Fifteen control animals (C1, C7, C28) underwent anesthesia alone. Another 15 animals were exposed to three SWT sessions applying 1000 sw at 1 BAR and analyzed identically (low-dose/energy level, LD-3-1, -7, -28). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick-end labeling assay was used to define the apoptotic index (AI) and Masson's trichrome (MT) staining was prepared to evaluate smooth muscle-to-collagen ratios.

   RESULTS: ICP/MAP ratios for all C groups displayed a mean of 64%. All SWT groups demonstrated significantly reduced ICP/MAP ratios compared to their corresponding C groups (p<0.05). The LD-3 groups showed a trend toward improved ICP/MAP ratios. LD-3-28 demonstrated significant recovery compared to HD-3-28 (55+/-8% vs. 41+/-10%, p=0.004), but remained reduced compared to C28 (63+/-5%, p=0.03). No statistical differences were seen for MT staining in SWT groups compared to C (p>0.05). AIs for the LD-3 groups were significantly lower compared to the HD-3 groups (p<0.001), but all AIs were significantly increased compared to C groups (p<0.01).

   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, at both energy/dose levels, SWT resulted in a time- and treatment-dependent reduction of ICP/MAP ratios, which might be mediated partly through apoptosis and collagenization of corporal smooth muscle.

Abstract
  Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are the most frequent side-effects in the postoperative period, impairing subjective well-being and having economic impact due to delayed discharge. However, emetic symptoms can also cause major medical complications, and post-craniotomy patients may be at an increased risk. A review and critical appraisal of the existing literature on PONV in post-craniotomy patients, and a comparison of these findings with the current knowledge on PONV in the general surgical population, leads to the following conclusions: (1) Despite the lack of a documented case of harm caused by retching or vomiting in a post-craniotomy patient, the potential risk caused by arterial hypertension and high intra-abdominal/intra-thoracic pressure leading to high intracranial pressure, forces to avoid PONV in these patients. (2) There is unclarity about a specifically increased (or decreased) risk for PONV in post-craniotomy patients compared with other surgical procedures. (3) The decision whether or not to administer an antiemetic should not be based primarily on risk scores for PONV but on the likelihood for potential catastrophic consequences of PONV. If such a risk cannot be ruled out, a multimodal antiemetic approach should be considered regardless of the individual risk. (4) Randomized controlled trials with antiemetics in post-craniotomy patients are limited with respect to sample size and methodological quality. This also impacts upon the meaning of meta-analyses performed with trials that showed marked heterogeneity and inconclusive results. (5) No studies on the treatment of established PONV are available. This highlights the need to transfer knowledge about PONV treatment from other surgical procedures. (6) Despite the possibility that PONV in post-craniotomy patients can be triggered by specific conditions (e.g. surgery near the area postrema at the floor of the fourth ventricle with the vomiting centre located nearby), recommendations based on trials in post-craniotomy patients may be flawed. Thus, general knowledge on prevention and treatment of PONV must adopted for craniotomy settings. [References: 66]

Abstract
  The authors describe the novel use of computed tomography (CT) venography in the preoperative evaluation of a child with Crouzon syndrome who was being considered for Chiari decompression. This 18-month-old girl presented with hydrocephalus (treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt) and persistent symptomatic Chiari malformation and associated syrinx. A CT venogram was obtained because of the well-described relationship between multisutural craniosynostosis and abnormal intracranial-to-extracranial venous drainage. The CT venogram showed widely dilated vertebral and paravertebral veins located in the paraspinous muscles of the craniocervical junction. Because of the risk of massive intraoperative blood loss and/or occlusion of important collateral draining veins leading to intracranial venous hypertension and intractably raised intracranial pressure, the planned posterior fossa decompression was not performed. Computed tomography venography is an easily obtained study that we recommend in the evaluation of children with multisutural craniosynostosis prior to cranial surgical interventions.

Abstract
  The purpose of this paper is to discuss the basic study of mechanism of brain injury analytically and experimentally, in respect to the frequency analysis of the pressure changes. First, a three-dimensional FEM model for impact analysis was presented. The pressure changes inside a brain agar phantom and its frequency analysis were calculated. Second, an experimental system to perform an impact experiment was presented. In the impact experiments, the pressure changes inside a brain agar phantom after impact were measured. The comparison of the computer simulation and the experimental results of the impacts showed that the negative pressure, which seemed to cause the contrecoup injury at the contrecoup side of a brain, also appeared in the contrecoup side of the brain agar phantom. Finally the results of the frequency analysis of pressure changes by FFT were presented. From the results of computer simulations and impact experiments, we found similar spectrums in some frequency bands, which seemed to be the occurrence of the brain injury.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To describe and report the reliability of a portable, laptop-based, real-time, continuous physiologic data acquisition system (PDAS) that allows for synchronous recording of physiologic data, clinical events, and event markers at the bedside for physiologic research studies in the intensive care unit.

   DESIGN: Descriptive report of new research technology.

   SETTING: Adult and pediatric intensive care units in three tertiary care academic hospitals.

   PATIENTS: Sixty-four critically ill and injured patients were studied, including 34 adult (22 males and 12 females) and 30 pediatric (19 males and 11 females).

   INTERVENTIONS: None.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data transmission errors during bench and field testing were measured. The PDAS was used in three separate research studies, by multiple users, and for repeated recordings of the same set of signals at various intervals for different lengths of time. Both parametric (1 Hz) and waveform (125-500 Hz) signals were recorded and analyzed. Details of the PDAS components are explained and examples are given from the three experimental physiology-based protocols. Waveform data include electrocardiogram, respiration, systemic arterial pressure (invasive and noninvasive), oxygen saturation, central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, left and right atrial pressures, intracranial pressure, and regional cerebral blood flow. Bench and field testing of the PDAS demonstrated excellent reliability with 100% accuracy and no data transmission errors. The key feature of simultaneously capturing physiologic signal data and clinical events (e.g., changes in mechanical ventilation, drug administration, clinical condition) is emphasized.

   CONCLUSIONS: The PDAS provides a reliable tool to record physiologic signals and associated clinical events on a second-to-second basis and may serve as an important adjunctive research tool in designing and performing clinical physiologic studies in critical illness and injury.

Abstract
  Cerebral edema is frequently encountered in clinical practice in critically ill patients with acute brain injury from diverse origins and is a major cause of increased morbidity and death in this subset of patients. The consequences of cerebral edema can be lethal and include cerebral ischemia from compromised regional or global cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial compartmental shifts due to intracranial pressure gradients that result in compression of vital brain structures. The overall goal of medical management of cerebral edema is to maintain regional and global CBF to meet the metabolic requirements of the brain and prevent secondary neuronal injury from cerebral ischemia. Medical management of cerebral edema involves using a systematic and algorithmic approach, from general measures (optimal head and neck positioning for facilitating intracranial venous outflow, avoidance of dehydration and systemic hypotension, and maintenance of normothermia) to specific therapeutic interventions (controlled hyperventilation, administration of corticosteroids and diuretics, osmotherapy, and pharmacological cerebral metabolic suppression). This article reviews and highlights the medical management of cerebral edema based on pathophysiological principles in acute brain injury. [References: 114]

Abstract
  OBJECT: The recently described condition of longstanding overt ventriculomegaly in adults (LOVA) has not been defined in terms of the need for intervention, timing of intervention, and ideal treatment. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the role of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in the treatment of LOVA.

   METHODS: Data collected in six patients with LOVA who had undergone ETV were reviewed retrospectively in terms of the definition of treatment success, rates of success, complications, and outcome. All six patients presented with headache disorders. In all patients, triventricular hydrocephalus had been diagnosed as aqueductal stenosis, and head circumference measurements were above the 98th percentile. All six had undergone successful ETV as documented by the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid into the basal cisterns, which remained open throughout the follow-up period. After the procedure, one patient experienced a mild degree of difficulty with short-term memory. Five patients remained symptomatic or had symptoms requiring further treatment 3 months to 3 years after ETV. Four patients received ventriculoperitoneal shunts, and one underwent venous stenting for high intracranial pressure after successful ETV. In two patients in whom aqueductal stenosis had been diagnosed, the sylvian aqueduct was patent after the procedure.

   CONCLUSIONS: In LOVA patients who present with headaches, ETV may not lead to improvement in the headaches. Despite the presence of triventricular hydrocephalus, closure of the aqueduct may be a secondary phenomenon, and flow through the aqueduct may be reestablished after ETV. If intracranial hypertension persists after successful ETV, its cause may be increased venous sinus pressure.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilution therapy (triple-H therapy) is a generally accepted treatment for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the particular role of the three components of triple-H therapy remains controversial. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the three arms of triple-H therapy on regional cerebral blood flow and brain tissue oxygenation.

   DESIGN: Animal research and clinical intervention study.

   SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

   SUBJECTS AND PATIENTS: Experiments were carried out in five healthy pigs, followed by a clinical investigation of ten patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

   INTERVENTIONS: First, we investigated the effect of the three components of triple-H therapy under physiologic conditions in an experimental pig model. In the next step we applied the same study protocol to patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Mean arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, cardiac output, regional cerebral blood flow, and brain tissue oxygenation were continuously recorded. Intrathoracic blood volume and central venous pressure were measured intermittently. Vasopressors and/or colloids and crystalloids were administered to stepwise establish the three components of triple-H therapy.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the animals, neither induced hypertension nor hypervolemia had an effect on intracranial pressure, brain tissue oxygenation, or regional cerebral blood flow. In the patient population, induction of hypertension (mean arterial pressure 143 +/- 10 mm Hg) resulted in a significant (p < .05) increase of regional cerebral blood flow and brain tissue oxygenation at all observation time points. In contrast, hypervolemia/hemodilution (intrathoracic blood volume index 1123 +/- 152 mL/m) induced only a slight increase of regional cerebral blood flow while brain tissue oxygenation did not improve. Finally, triple-H therapy failed to improve regional cerebral blood flow more than hypertension alone and was characterized by the drawback that the hypervolemia/hemodilution component reversed the effect of induced hypertension on brain tissue oxygenation.

   CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressor-induced elevation of mean arterial pressure caused a significant increase of regional cerebral blood flow and brain tissue oxygenation in all patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Volume expansion resulted in a slight effect on regional cerebral blood flow only but reversed the effect on brain tissue oxygenation. In view of the questionable benefit of hypervolemia on regional cerebral blood flow and the negative consequences on brain tissue oxygenation together with the increased risk of complications, hypervolemic therapy as a part of triple-H therapy should be applied with utmost caution.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative syndrome; cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare complication.

   OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 20-year-old woman with an uneventful history who was admitted with intracranial hypertension syndrome which had developed over the last four months in association with bilateral decline of visual acuity. Physical examination at admission revealed stage II papilloedema and absence of any focal neurological signs. The brain MRI and the venous MRA showed a thrombosis involving the superior longitudinal sinus and the lateral sinus. The etiological analysis disclosed essential thrombocythemia (ET). The patient was given an antiedema and anticoagulant treatment. Later, an etiological cytoreductive therapy was initiated. Signs of intracranial hypertension regressed progressively with persistence of acute visual disorders associated with sequelar optical atrophy. Discussion. ET is a rare cause of CVT. Reports in the literature have discussed the mechanisms, the physiology, the therapeutic modalities and the clinical course of these CVTs secondarily to ET.

   CONCLUSION: Stroke, especially transient ischemic attack, is the usual thrombotic expression of myeloproliferative syndrome. CVT is much more exceptional.

Abstract
  Patients on long-term hemodialysis undergo multiple interventions, including insertion of central catheters and arteriovenous anastomoses for creation of vascular access. The need for high-flow vessels to maintain hemodialysis efficiency leads to wear on the central veins and consequent stenosis and occlusion. In addition to local signs of impaired venous drainage, abnormal venous flow patterns involving the upper chest, face, and central nervous system might develop. We describe the first pediatric case of devastating intracranial hypertension presenting with visual loss in the eye contralateral to a high-flow vascular access in a patient on long-term hemodialysis. The literature on this rare complication of hemodialysis is reviewed.

Abstract
  Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) exerts effects not only on intra-abdominal organs, but also on organs distant to the abdominal compartment. Abdomino-thoracic interaction during intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) interferes with pulmonary, cardiovascular and cerebral function. In accordance with recent guidelines, IAH is defined as IAP above 12 mmHg and ACS as IAP more than 20 mmHg with one or more new organ failures. In this review we will first discuss the effects of elevated IAP on pulmonary dynamics and the relevance for interpreting airway pressures and adjusting ventilator settings. We will then discuss the interaction between abdomino-thoracic pressure transmission and global haemodynamics, the knowledge of which is necessary for correct assessment of cardiac preload and to optimize fluid therapy in the setting of IAH/ACS. A discussion on the relationship between increased IAP, increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) will follow. Finally, we will review ventilator-induced thoracic pressure swings and their transmission to the abdominal compartment. [References: 53]

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome are a common occurrence in ICU patients. The deleterious effects of IAH on organ function are well known and increasingly appreciated in recent years, especially where renal and respiratory function are concerned.

   METHODS: This review will focus on the available literature from the last years.A Medline and PubMed search was performed in order to find an answer to the question "What is the impact of increased IAP on neurologic function in the critically ill?"

   RESULTS: The amount of data on the influence of IAH on the central nervous system is more scarce, but several animal and human studies have demonstrated a clear correlation between intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP). This correlation is probably due to transmission of the increased IAP to the thorax leading to increased intrathoracic, pleural pressure and central venous pressure, decreased venous return from the brain and increased ICP. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the increase in ICP is abolished when a sternotomy and pleuropericardotomy are performed, and by the fact that abdominal decompression has produced good results in treating refractory intracranial hypertension (ICH) in patients with both IAH and ICH.

   CONCLUSIONS: A close relationship between IAP and ICP has been observed in several animal and human studies. The clinical impact of this association is dependent on the baseline ICP and the compensatory reserve of the patient. Some studies have reported good results in treating refractory ICH by abdominal decompression in patients with concomitant IAH. Monitoring of IAP and ICP in risk patients is essential.

Abstract
  Elevated intracranial intravenous pressure seems to be of importance in pseudotumor cerebri syndromes, either as a cause (secondary intracranial hypertension) or as a consequence (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) of increased intracranial pressure. We present 3 case reports in which diagnostic imaging before and after CSF diversion provided evidence that narrowing of the transverse sinuses is a secondary phenomenon. Stent angioplasty of the venous sinuses should not be considered a therapeutic approach in these cases.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Fluid therapy and/or acute lung injury may increase intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and intrathoracic pressure, thereby increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Further fluid administration to support cerebral perfusion or increasing ventilatory support to treat acute lung injury further increases ICP. This can create a cycle that ultimately produces multiple compartment syndrome (MCS). Both decompressive craniectomy (DC) and decompressive laparotomy (DL) decrease ICP. DL can also decrease IAP and ICP. We evaluated the serial application of DC and DL to treat MCS.

   METHODS: Data were analyzed for 102 consecutive patients with severe TBI who underwent DC alone to decrease ICP or in combination with DL to treat MCS.

   RESULTS: All 102 patients sustained blunt injury. Seventy percent were men with a mean age of 29.5 years, an Injury Severity Score of 34.4, and admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7.1. Fifty-one patients had diffuse brain injury and 51 had mass lesions. Seventy-eight patients (76%) underwent DC alone. Twenty-four (22%) had both therapies for MCS. Fifteen patients had DC before DL and nine had DL before DC. Mean time between DC and DL was 3.4 +/- 6 days. The mean IAP before DL was 28 +/- 5 mm Hg. Twenty-four-hour cumulative mean intrathoracic pressure decreased significantly after DL in the MCS group (p = 0.01). Mean ICP decreased significantly after both DC and DL (p < 0.05).

   CONCLUSION: Increased ICP may be from primary TBI or MCS. Patients with MCS have a higher Injury Severity Score, ICP, and fluid requirements, but no increase in mortality. Both DC and DL reduce ICP and can be used in sequence. MCS should be considered in multiply injured patients with increased ICP that does not respond to therapy.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Hypertensive, hypervolemic, and hemodilutional (HHH) therapy for vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) refractory to phenylephrine requires high doses of catecholamines, leading to adverse adrenergic effects. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been shown to stabilize advanced shock states while facilitating reduction of catecholamine doses, but its use has never been reported in SAH. In this retrospective study, we investigated the hemodynamic effects and feasibility of supplementary AVP in refractory HHH therapy in SAH.

   METHODS: Hemodynamic response (mean arterial pressure [MAP], heart rate, central venous pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, and end diastolic volume index) to a supplementary AVP infusion (0.01-0.04 IU/minute) was recorded within the first 24 hours in 22 patients. Secondary endpoints (serum sodium concentration, incidence of vasospasm, and intracranial pressure [ICP]) were compared to controls on HHH therapy with phenylephrine alone.

   RESULTS: After initiation of AVP, MAP increased significantly compared to baseline. Phenylephrine doses decreased significantly, whereas other hemodynamic parameters remained stable. Serum sodium concentrations decreased similarly in both groups (-5 +/- 7 mmol/L versus -6 +/- 4 mmol/L; p = 0.25). No detrimental effects on vasospasm incidence or ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure were noted.

   CONCLUSION: AVP may be considered as an alternative supplementary vasopressor in refractory HHH therapy with phenylephrine in SAH. Although we did not observe any deleterious effect of AVP on cerebral circulation, close observation for development of cerebral vasospasm should be undertaken, until it is clearly demonstrated that AVP has no adverse effects on regional cerebral blood flow and symptomatic cerebral vasospasm. Our limited data suggest that low-dose AVP does not cause brain edema, but further study is merited.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Optic nerve sheath fenestration or ventricular shunting are classically proposed after failure of medical treatment. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is caused by venous sinus obstruction in an unknown percentage of cases. Recently, endoluminal venous sinus stenting was proposed as an alternative treatment.

   PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 2003 and December 2004, eight consecutive patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension underwent MRI venography and direct retrograde cerebral angiography.

   RESULTS: There were five females and three males aged 22 to 55 years. All patients had vision disorders. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure ranged from 27 to 45 mmHg with normal composition. All patients presented at least one sinus stenosis. Endovascular stenting of the stenotic venous sinus was performed under intravenous heparin administration. Anti-platelet therapy was administered for 3 months post treatment. Intra-sinus pressures were invariably reduced by stenting. Mean follow-up was 18 months. All patients improved clinically. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure had normalized at 3-month follow-up in all patients. In all patients, multidetector row CT-angiography or MRI venography was performed at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up and demonstrated the patency of the stent.

   DISCUSSION: The importance of venous sinus disease as a cause of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is probably underestimated. Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension should be evaluated with direct retrograde cerebral venography and manometry. In patients with venous sinus lesions, treatment by an endoluminal venous sinus stent is a safe and effective alternative for amenable lesions.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Hospital preparedness for infectious disease emergencies is imperative for local, regional, and national response planning.

   METHODS: A secondary data analysis was conducted of a survey administered to Infection Control Professionals (ICPs) in May, 2005.

   RESULTS: Most hospitals have ICP representation on their disaster committee, around-the-clock infection control support, a plan to prioritize health care workers to receive vaccine or antivirals, and non-health care facility surge beds. Almost 20% lack a surge capacity plan. Some lack negative pressure rooms for current patient loads or any surge capacity. Less than half have a plan for rapid set-up of negative pressure, and Midwest hospitals are less likely than other areas to have such plans. Smaller hospitals have less negative pressure surge capacity than do larger hospitals. About half have enough health care workers to respond to a surge that involves < or =50 patients; few can handle > or =100 patients. Many do not have sufficient ventilators or can handle < or =10 additional ventilated patients. Most do not have enough National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved respirators, and less than half have sufficient surgical masks to handle a significant surge.

   CONCLUSIONS: United States hospitals lack negative pressure, health care worker, and medical equipment/supplies surge capacity. Hospitals must continue to address gaps in infectious disease emergency planning.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: There are few reproducible models of blast injury, so it is difficult to evaluate new or existing therapies. We developed a clinically relevant polytrauma model to test the hypothesis that cerebrovascular resuscitation is optimized when intravenous fluid is restricted.

   STUDY DESIGN: Anesthetized swine (42+/-5 kg, n=35) received blasts to the head and bilateral chests with captive bolt guns, followed by hypoventilation (4 breaths/min; FiO(2)=0.21). After 30 minutes, resuscitation was divided into phases to simulate typical prehospital, emergency room, and ICU care. For 30 to 45 minutes, group 1, the control group (n=5), received 1L of normal saline (NS). For 45 to 120 minutes, additional NS was titrated to mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg. After 120 minutes, mannitol (1g/kg) and phenylephrine were administered to manage cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) > 70 mmHg, plus additional NS was given to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) > 12 mmHg. In group 2 (n=5), MAP and CPP targets were the same, but the CVP target was>8 mmHg. Group 3 (n=5) received 1 L of NS followed only by CPP management. Group 4 (n=5) received Hextend (Abbott Laboratories), instead of NS, to the same MAP and CPP targets as group 2.

   RESULTS: Polytrauma caused 13 deaths in the 35 animals. In survivors, at 30 minutes, MAP was 60 to 65 mmHg, heart rate was >100 beats/min, PaO(2) was < 50 mmHg, and lactate was>5 mmol/L. In two experiments, no fluid or pressor was administered; the tachycardia and hypotension persisted. The first liter of intravenous fluid partially corrected these variables, and also partially corrected mixed venous O(2), gastric and portal venous O(2), cardiac output, renal blood flow, and urine output. Additional NS (total of 36+/-1 mL/kg/h and 17+/-6 mL/kg/h, in groups 1 and 2, respectively) correlated with increased intracranial pressure to 38+/-4 mmHg (group 1) and 26+/-4 mmHg (group 2) versus 22+/-4 mmHg in group 3 (who received 5+/-1 mL/kg/h). CPP was maintained only after mannitol and phenylephrine. By 5 hours, brain tissue PO(2) was>20 mmHg in groups 1 and 2, but only 6+/-1 mmHg in group 3. In contrast, minimal Hextend (6+/-3 mL/kg/h) was needed; the corrections in MAP and CPP were immediate and sustained, intracranial pressure was lower (14+/-2 mmHg), and brain tissue PO(2) was> 20 mmHg. Neuropathologic changes were consistent with traumatic brain injury, but there were no statistically significant differences between groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: After polytrauma and resuscitation to standard MAP and CPP targets with mannitol and pressor therapy, we concluded that intracranial hypertension was attenuated and brain oxygenation was maintained with intravenous fluid restriction; cerebrovascular resuscitation was optimized with Hextend versus NS; and longer term studies are needed to determine neuropathologic consequences.

Abstract
  Sinus pericranii is a vascular tumor of the head having communication with the dural venous system. The tumor enlarges with increased intracranial pressure when the patient is in the lateral recumbent position. Since Stromeyer used the term "sinus pericranii" in his report in 1850, approximately 170 cases have been reported. However, relatively few cases of sinus pericranii have been reported in association with craniosynostosis or by plastic surgeons. In this study, we report seven cases of sinus pericranii associated with craniosynostosis. There were two patients with Apert syndrome, two with Crouzon syndrome, two with oxycephaly, and one with trigonocephaly. The sites of occurrence were the parietal region in six patients and the frontal region in one patient. In either type of case, the tumor was clinically a soft subcutaneous mass of the head. The clinical characteristics of the tumor were its disappearance when the patient was in a sitting position and its appearance when the patient was in a recumbent position or crying. The patients were preoperatively diagnosed with sinus pericranii from imaging test findings, such as from magnetic resonance imaging and aforementioned clinical findings. In all cases, treatment for sinus pericranii was performed during the surgery for craniosynostosis. For patients with lesions in either site, we did not perform craniotomy, and we used a minimally invasive method of tumor excision and resection of the sites of communication using electrocoagulation. Perioperatively, heavy hemorrhage was not observed, and, postoperatively, no recurrence has been observed in any patient. In this study, we examine the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of sinus pericranii, in particular for patients with craniosynostosis.

Abstract
  The aim of this study is to discuss the occurrence mechanism of the brain injury analytically and experimentally. In this paper, first, an experimental system to do an impact experiment was presented. The pressure changes inside a brain agar phantom were measured. Second, a three-dimensional FEM model of the impact experiment was constructed. From the results of the fundamental analysis, the transmitted pressure inside the brain agar phantom could be presented. The comparison of the computer simulation and experimental results showed that the negative pressure values, same as the positive pressure occurred in the coup side region of the agar, also appeared in the contrecoup side region of the agar.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) usually is taken care of by medical management or neuro-interventional vascular techniques. Some cases of CVST may take a malignant course if the intracranial pressure increases excessively. This increase in pressure is because of oedema in brain tissue due to impediment in venous return and/or intracerebral haemorrhage. Neurosurgical experience has shown remarkable recovery in these moribund patients if appropriate surgical intervention is done within reasonable time. Emergent decompressive craniotomy or other neurosurgical interventions are the only appropriate treatment in these malignant forms of CVST to prevent mortality and severe morbidity. [References: 21]

Abstract
  Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an under diagnosed condition for acute or slowly progressive neurological deficit. CVT is less frequent than arterial thrombosis. CVT has a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms, which may evolve suddenly or over the weeks. It is clinically challenging and mimics many neurological conditions such as, meningitis, encephalopathy, benign intracranial hypertension, and stroke. With increasing awareness, CVT cases are now being diagnosed more frequently. Newer imaging procedures have led to easier recognition of venous sinus thrombosis, offering the opportunity for early therapeutic measures. It may be difficult to diagnose it on clinical grounds alone. Headache is the most frequent symptom in patients with CVT, present in about 80% of cases. Most common pattern of presentation is with a benign intracranial hypertension-like syndrome. The prognosis of CVT is worse in elderly subjects. The shorter the history the more likely is the presence of focal signs. Sixth cranial nerve palsy usually manifests as false localizing sign. Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) has been described, as the presenting event with CVT. Patients may have seizures that can be recurrent. Cranial nerve syndromes are seen with venous sinus thrombosis. Psychiatric disturbances are sometimes the presenting symptoms. CVT, an important cause of stroke in puerperium, is frequently observed in India. We have seen 6 patients of CVT out of 490 stroke registry. Of these 6, four were females and two were males. The mean age among females was 27.75 years and among males was 41.5 years. Of the 4 females two were postpartum; one was on oral contraceptive and in one Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) were positive. Amongst two males one had hyperhomocysteinemia and one had hyperlipidemia. [References: 20]

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential to use subatmospheric intrathoracic pressure to regulate intracranial pressure (ICP) in normovolemic and hypovolemic animals, we tested the hypothesis that mechanical devices designed to reduce intrathoracic pressure will decrease ICP in a dose-related manner. An inspiratory impedance threshold device was used in spontaneously breathing animals and an intrathoracic pressure regulator was attached to a positive pressure ventilator and used in apneic animals: both devices lower intrathoracic pressure.

   DESIGN: Prospective, randomized animal study.

   SETTING: Animal laboratory facilities.

   SUBJECTS: A total of 36 female farm pigs in four different protocols (n = 12, 6, 12, and 6, respectively).

   INTERVENTIONS, MEASUREMENTS, AND MAIN RESULTS: In all protocols, endotracheal, right atrial, central aortic, and ICP were measured continuously. In protocol 1, spontaneously breathing animals were randomized to breath for 15 mins through an impedance threshold device with a cracking pressure of -10 or -15 mm Hg. In protocol 2, after untreated ventricular fibrillation for 4 mins and successful defibrillation to a normal rhythm, spontaneously breathing pigs were used to evaluate the effect of two different impedance threshold device cracking pressures (-10 and -15 mm Hg) on increased ICP. In protocol 3, the acute effects of an intrathoracic pressure regulator on ICP were evaluated in combination with a positive pressure mechanical ventilator in apneic hypovolemic hypotensive pigs after 35% or 50% blood loss. In protocol 4, after 40% blood loss, an intrathoracic pressure regulator was applied for 120 mins and ICP was recorded to determine whether the intrathoracic pressure regulator effects were sustained over time. Inspiratory impedance successfully decreased ICP in spontaneously breathing pigs in a dose-dependent manner and decreased elevated ICP immediately after cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. The same effect was seen in apneic animals with the use of the intrathoracic pressure regulator. The effect was more pronounced in hypovolemia, and it was sustained for >/=2 hrs.

   CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of intrathoracic pressure to subatmospheric levels resulted in an instantaneous and sustained reduction in ICP in spontaneously breathing and apneic animals. The effect was most pronounced in the hypovolemic animals.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of hypertronic saline and mannitol use in cerebral edema.

   DESIGN: Retrospective study.

   SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit.

   SUBJECTS: 67 patients with cerebral edema.

   METHODS: Patients with cerebral edema treated with either mannitol or hypertronic saline (HS) (Group II: n = 25), and both mannitol and HS (Group III: n = 20) were evaluated retrospectively. Cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure were based on the clinical and/or radiological (CT, MR) findings. When treating with both mannitol and HS (Group IIIA), if patients serum osmality was greater than 325 mosmol/L, mannitol was stopped and patients were treated with only HS (Group IIIB). All patients were closely monitored for fever, pulse, blood pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), oxygen saturation, volume of fluid intake and urine output. Mannitol was given at a dose of 0.25-0.5 g/kg while the hypertonic saline was given as 3% saline to maintain the serum-Na within the range of 155-165 mEq/L.

   RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in terms of Glasgow coma scale, age, gender, and etiologic distribution between the groups. And also distribution of the other treatments given for cerebral edema is not significiant. Mannitol was given for a total dose of 9.3 +/-5.0 (2-16) doses in Group I, and 6.5 +/-2.8 (2-10) doses in Group III. Hypertonic saline was infused for 4-25 times in Group II. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the highest serum Na and osmolarity levels of the groups, duration of comatose state and mortality rate were significantly lower in Group II and Group III A B. Patients who received only HS were subdivided according to their serum Na concentrations into 2 groups as those between 150-160 mEqL and those between 160-170 mEqL. The duration of comatose state and mortality was not different in patients with serum-Na of 150-160 mEqL and in patients with 160-170 mEqL in the hypertonic saline receiving patients. Four patients in the group II developed hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and 2 patients in the group I had hypotension. As two patients in group II had diabetes insipidus and one patient had renal failure in group I, the treatment was terminated. The causes of death were septic shock, ventilator associated pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, progressive cerebral edema and cerebral edema with pulmonary edema. Multivariate analysis showed that age, gender, cause of cerebral edema, electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycemia and hyper-ventilation had no significant impact on outcome.

   CONCLUSION: Hypertonic saline seems to be more effective than mannitol in the cerebral edema.

Abstract
  OBJECT: The goal in this study was to determine if there was a change in intracranial venous diameters after endovascular treatment of carotid distribution vasospasm caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage.

   METHODS: The venous diameters were measured in all patients who received intraarterial papaverine and/or balloon angioplasty for treatment of vasospasm during the study period of 3 years. To evaluate the veins of Labbe and Trolard, the straight sinus, and the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), measurements were performed in a blinded manner with the aid of a magnification loupe. Predetermined sites were evaluated on angiograms obtained before and after endovascular treatment. Forty-three treatments in 26 patients were included: 18 patients (33 territories) were treated with intraarterial papaverine alone, four (four territories) were treated with balloon angioplasty alone, and four (six territories) were treated with both papaverine infusion and angioplasty. The mean measured venous diameters increased significantly after addition of papaverine (10.9%), and also after combined papaverine and angioplasty (4.2%). There was no statistically significant increase in the mean venous diameters after angioplasty alone. If the initial intracranial pressure (ICP) was less than 15 mm Hg before treatment, the veins showed a greater tendency to dilate than if the initial ICP measurements were greater than 15 mm Hg. The straight sinus and the SSS increased more in diameter than the veins of Labbe and Trolard. There was no statistically significant correlation between the change in venous diameters with treatment and ICP.

   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment produces measurable increases in intracranial venous diameters. However, these changes do not correlate with changes in ICP.

Abstract
  In a porcine model of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, we evaluated the effects of fluid resuscitation versus arginine vasopressin (AVP) combined with hypertonic-hyperoncotic hydroxyethyl starch solution (HHS) on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and on cerebral metabolism using intracerebral microdialysis. Sixteen anesthetized pigs were subjected to uncontrolled liver bleeding until hemodynamic decompensation, followed by resuscitation using either fluid (n = 8) or AVP/HHS (n = 8). Thirty minutes after drug administration, bleeding was controlled by manual compression, and colloid and crystalloid solutions were administered in both groups. All surviving animals were observed for one hour. After hemodynamic decompensation, fluid resuscitation resulted in a smaller increase of CPP than did AVP/HHS (mean +/- sem; 24 +/- 5 vs 45 +/- 7 mm Hg; P < 0.01). Mean (+/- sem) cerebral venous partial pressure of oxygen was significantly decreased (P < 0.01) 5 min after fluid compared with 5 min after AVP/HHS administration (36 +/- 3 vs 64 +/- 4 torr). Cerebral metabolism was comparable in both groups. In conclusion, AVP/HHS proved to be superior to fluid in the initial phase of therapy with respect to CPP and cerebral oxygenation, but was comparable to fluid regarding cerebral metabolism and secondary cell damage in surviving animals.

Abstract
  In subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), Cushing postulated that the increase in systemic arterial pressure (SAP) in response to elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) was beneficial to cerebral perfusion. However, in uncontrolled SAH, the increased SAP may cause more bleeding into the subarachnoid space and further increase the ICP. We created an animal model to simulate SAH by connecting a femoral arterial catheter to the subarachnoid space. The global cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with a venous outflow method. The purposes were to observe the CBF change under the simulated SAH, and to evaluate the effects of an adrenergic blocker and a vasodilator. In addition, spectral analysis of the aortic pressure and flow was employed for the analysis of hemodynamic changes at various ICP levels. When the femoral arterial blood was allowed to flow into the subarachnoid space, the ICP was elevated. The Cushing response to increased ICP caused an increase in SAP. A vicious cycle was generated between ICP and SAP. The CBF under the vicious cycle was greatly depressed. The dog developed pulmonary edema (PE) within 5 mins. An alpha-adrenergic blocker (phentolamine) and a vasodilator (nitroprusside) were beneficial to the reduction of SAP and ICP, improvement of CBF, and prevention of PE. Hemodynamic analysis revealed that graded increases in ICP caused increases in SAP, total peripheral resistance, arterial impedance, and pulse reflection with decreases in stroke volume, cardiac output and arterial compliance. The hemodynamic changes may contribute to acute left ventricular failure that leads to pressure and volume loading in the lung circulation, and finally acute PE.

Abstract
  Cerebral vasospasm and its associated ischemia are one of the main causes of death in 23% of patients with prior aneurysmal subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH). At present, a diversity of approaches to treating vasospasm has been developed, among them hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution (deriving its abbreviated name 3H-therapy) offers certain advantages. At the same time a number of aspects of application of this approach remain unclear. Fifty-four patients with significant cerebral arterial spasm (elevated linear systolic blood flow velocity > or = 200 cm/s) who had been operated on in the acute period of aneurysmal SAH were selected. Of them, 18 patients had undergone hypervolemic hypertensive hemodilution (3H-therapy) under guidance of systemic hemodynamics, by using a Swan-Ganz catheter (these patients formed a study group). Thirty-six patients who had not undergone 3H-therapy under invasive monitoring of systemic hemodynamics constituted a control group. Hypervolemic hypertensive hemodilution was performed by means of continuous intravenous infusion of a combination of colloid-crystalloid solutions. The therapy was considered to be adequate by meeting the following requirements: maintenance of cardiac index not less 3.5 l/min/m2, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure below 14-16 mm Hg or central venous pressure under to 8-10 mm Hg, packed cell volume below 28-32%, and systolic blood pressure under 200 mm Hg. Hypervolemic hypertensive hemodilution (3H-therapy) applied to patients operated on in the acute period of aneurysmal SAH was effective in increasing cardiac output, central venous pressure, systemic arterial pressure and hence cerebral perfusion with the minimum number of complications unassociated with the use of this technique. This permitted a reduction in mortality rates in patients with baseline Hunt-Hess grade I-III SAH. At the same time, it should be emphasized that 3H-therapy may be used in neurosurgical patients, by thoroughly monitoring the parameters of central hemodynamics, blood coagulation system, cerebral circulation and, desirably, intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of hemodynamic changes leading to intraoperative hypotension during evacuation of acute subdural hematoma. To our knowledge, little data is available about the mechanism of hemodynamic changes during surgical interventions to decrease intracranial pressure after severe head injury. The influence of preoperative hypotension on intraoperative hypotension was examined. Hemodynamic studies (pulmonary artery catheterization) were carried out in 15 patients before and after acute subdural hematoma evacuation. All patients were assessed for hemodynamic parameters, evacuated hematoma volume, and intracranial pressure measurements. Comparison between just before and after evacuation of the hematoma showed that the mean arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure all decreased after hematoma evacuation. However, the cardiac index was unchanged after hematoma evacuation. Mean arterial blood pressure is dependent on the cardiac index and vascular resistance, so the decrease in arterial blood pressure during hematoma evacuation was the result of a decline in vascular resistance. The influence of preoperative blood pressure on intraoperative hemodynamic changes was analyzed by dividing the patients into two groups, the preoperative hypotension group and preoperative nonhypotension group. The decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was more marked in the preoperative hypotension group than in the preoperative nonhypotension group. Intraoperative hypotension during evacuation of acute subdural hematoma is caused by a decrease in vascular resistance. Preoperative hypotension is a also risk factor for intraoperative hypotension.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: A new device, the intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR), was developed to generate continuous negative intrathoracic pressure during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and allow for intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Use of the ITPR has been shown to increase vital organ perfusion and short-term survival rates in pigs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic and blood gas effects of more prolonged (15 min) use of the ITPR during CPR in a porcine model of cardiac arrest.

   METHODS: After 8 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation (VF), 16 female pigs were anaesthetized with propofol, intubated, and randomized prospectively to 15 min of either ITPR-CPR or standard (STD) CPR. Compressions were delivered at a rate of 100/min with a compression to ventilation ratio of 15:2. Ventilations were delivered with a resuscitator bag. Tracheal, aortic, right atrial, intracranial pressures (ICP), common carotid blood flow and respiratory variables were recorded continuously. Arterial and venous blood gases were collected at baseline, and after 5, 10, and 15 min of CPR. Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated as diastolic aortic pressure-right atrial pressure. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP) was calculated as mean arterial pressure (MAP)-intracranial pressure. Statistical analysis was performed with unpaired t-test and Friedman's Repeated Measures Analysis.

   RESULTS: ITPR-CPR when compared to STD-CPR resulted in a significant decrease in mean decompression phase (diastolic) tracheal pressure (-9+/-0.6 mmHg versus -3+/-0.3 mmHg, p<0.001), diastolic right atrial pressure (DRAP) (-0.1+/-0.2 mmHg versus 2.3+/-0.2 mmHg, p<0.001) and intracranial pressure (20.8+/-0.6 mmHg versus 23+/-0.5 mmHg, respectively, p=0.04) and a significant increase in total mean aortic pressure, coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures and end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)), (p<0.001). Common carotid artery blood flow was increased by an average of 70%, p<0.001. ABGs showed progressive metabolic acidosis in the ITPR-CPR group, but PaCO(2) remained stable at 34 mmHg for 15 min. In the STD-CPR group, pseudorespiratory alkalosis was observed with PaCO(2) values remaining <20 mmHg (p<0.001). PaO(2) was not different between groups. Following 23 min of cardiac arrest (15 min of CPR) ROSC was achieved in 5/8 ITPR-CPR animals versus 2/8 STD-CPR animals p=0.3.

   CONCLUSION: ITPR-CPR significantly improved hemodynamics, vital organ perfusion pressures and common carotid blood flow compared to STD-CPR in a porcine model of prolonged cardiac arrest and basic life support. The beneficial hemodynamic effects of ITPR-CPR were sustained at least 15 min without any compromise in oxygenation.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate hemodynamics in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) after cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) management using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage.

   METHODS: Twenty-six patients with TBI (Glasgow Coma Score = 8 or less) were investigated. Mean arterial blood pressure, CPP, cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), and central venous pressure were measured. The patients were divided into 2 groups after craniotomy: the intraparenchymal ICP (IP-ICP) monitoring group (n = 14) and ventricular ICP (V-ICP) monitoring group (n = 12). Patient hemodynamics were investigated on the second hospital day to identify differences. Measurements indicated a target CPP above 70 mmHg and a central venous pressure of 8 10 mmHg in both groups. Mannitol administration (IP-ICP group) or CSF drainage (V-ICP group) was performed whenever the CPP remained below 70 mmHg.

   RESULTS: High SVRI and low CI (p < 0.05) were observed in the IP-ICP group. The V-ICP group exhibited a reduction in the total fluid infusion volume of crystalloid (p < 0.01) and a reduction in the frequency of hypotensive episodes after the mannitol infusion.

   CONCLUSIONS: CPP management using CSF drainage decreases the total infusion volume of crystalloid and may reduce the risk of aggravated brain edema after excess fluid resuscitation.

Abstract
  Increased pressure in the dural venous sinuses has been proposed as the cause of increased intracranial pressure in the condition known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This hypothesis has received further support from manometry of the dural venous sinuses, showing a substantial proximal-to-distal pressure gradient, and from reports of improvement of IIH following stenting of the dural sinuses. Increased intracranial venous pressure has also been proposed as the cause of IIH in morbid obesity through increased abdominal pressure that is transmitted through the thorax to the cerebral draining veins. Although these hypotheses are intriguing, neither has enough scientific support to be endorsed yet. Moreover, dural venous sinus stenting should not be adopted as a therapeutic procedure in IIH until larger clinical trials attest to its safety and efficacy. [References: 22]

Abstract
  Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in hydrocephalus is believed to be related to increased intracranial pressure (ICP), vascular compression as the result of enlarged ventricles, or impaired metabolic activity. Little attention has been given to the relationship between cardiac function and systemic blood flow in chronic hydrocephalus (CH). Using an experimental model of chronic obstructive hydrocephalus developed in our laboratory, we investigated the relationship between the duration and severity of hydrocephalus and cardiac output (CO), CBF, myocardial tissue perfusion (MTP), and peripheral blood flow (PBF). Blood flow measures were obtained using the microsphere injection method under controlled hemodynamic conditions in experimental CH (n=23) and surgical control (n=8) canines at baseline and at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. Cardiac output measures were made using the Swan-Ganz thermodilution method. Intracranial compliance (ICC) via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bolus removal and infusion, and oxygen delivery in CSF and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were also investigated. We observed an initial surgical effect relating to 30% CO reduction and approximately 50% decrease in CBF, MTP, and PBF in both groups 2 weeks postoperatively, which recovered in control animals but continued to decline further in CH animals at 16 weeks. Cerebral blood flow, which was positively correlated with CO (P=0.028), showed no significant relationship with either CSF volume or pressure. Decreased CBF correlated with oxygen deprivation in PFC (P=0.006). Cardiac output was inversely related with ventriculomegaly (P=0.019), but did not correlate with ICP. Decreased CO corresponded to increased ICC, as measured by CSF infusion (P=0.04). Our results suggest that CH may have more of an influence on CO and CBF in the chronic stage than in the early condition, which was dominated by surgical effect. The cause of this late deterioration of cardiac function in hydrocephalus is uncertain, but may reflect cardiac regulation secondary to physiologic response or brain injury. The relationship between cardiac function and CBF should be considered in the pathophysiology and clinical treatment of CH.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous gasping is associated with increased survival in animal models of cardiac arrest and in observational studies of humans. The potential beneficial effect of gasping on cerebral perfusion may underlie the observed survival benefit, but mechanisms remain unknown.

   HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that spontaneous gasping in a pig model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) decreases intracranial pressure (ICP) and increases cerebral perfusion pressure (CePP) during VF in a pig model.

   METHODS: The 13 female farm pigs, weighing between 16 and 33 kg, were anesthetized with propofol and intubated, and then had VF induced for 8 min without intervention. Intrathoracic pressure (ITP), aortic pressure (AoP), and ICP were measured continuously. CePP and ITP were recorded simultaneously during three maximal gasps and correlated with gasping by Spearman rank correlation.

   RESULTS: Gasping during VF occurred in 13/13 pigs and followed a crescendo-decrescendo pattern. Each gasp was associated with a biphasic AoP (initial fall, then rise) and ICP (initial rise, then fall) morphology. Time to first gasp (r(2)=0.06), time to maximal gasp (r(2)=0.02), duration of gasping (r(2)=0.11) and frequency of gasping (r(2)=0.32) did not correlate significantly with CePP during gasping while depth of gasping exhibited a weak but significant correlation with CePP (r(2)=0.35, p=0.05). Maximal gasping occurred at 202+/-34 s from onset of VF and resulted in an average decrease in ICP from 27.4+/-5.8 to 20+/-6.7 mmHg, p<0.01 along with an increase in CePP from -0.05+/-10.9 to 11.5+/-12.6 mmHg, p<0.05.

   CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous gasping during cardiac arrest decreased intra-cranial pressure and increased cerebral perfusion pressure significantly. These results may help explain why gasping is associated with improved cardiac arrest survival rates. Based upon this new understanding of the physiology of gasping, we speculate that investigation of devices that can enhance the physiological effects of gasping on intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion should be prioritized.

Abstract
  A survey was conducted to assess the capacity and current practices of the infection surveillance and control programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs' 130 nursing home care units (VA NHCUs) covering a total of 15,006 beds in 2003. All 130 VA NHCUs responded to the survey, although not all NHCUs answered every question. The majority of the VA NHCUs provided specialized services that might pose increased risks of infection. For every 8 to 10 VA NHCU beds, there was 1 regular-pressure or negative-pressure infection control room available. Each VA NHCU had an active ongoing infection surveillance and control program managed by highly educated infection control personnel (ICP), of which 96% had a minimum of a bachelor degree. A median of 12 hours per week of these ICP efforts was devoted to the infection surveillance and control activities. The most frequently used surveillance methods were targeted surveillance for specific infections and for specific organisms. Most VA NHCUs conducted surveillance for antibiotic-resistant organisms. However, VA NHCUs did not use a uniform set of definitions for nosocomial infections for their infection surveillance and control purposes. We conclude that VA NHCUs have a considerable infrastructure and capacity for infection surveillance and control. This information can be used to develop a nationwide VA NHCU nosocomial infection surveillance system.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The etiological factors involved in idiopathic intracranial hypertension are not easy to identify. This case of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was associated with a capillary hemangioma growing in the lumen of the superior sagittal sinus.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old girl had experienced progressive headaches and abdominal pain. Fundoscopic examination disclosed bilateral papilledema and high intrathecal pressure, suggesting idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging, including magnetic resonance angiography as well as digital angiography, revealed a 3-cm mass protruding into the superior sagittal sinus lumen above the torcular.

   INTERVENTION: A capillary hemangioma attached to the internal dural wall of the sagittal sinus lumen was microsurgically removed. The symptoms resolved in several days and no additional treatment was required.

   CONCLUSION: A tumor growing into a venous sinus is a rare cause of venous outflow impairment and may generate the clinical signs of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This case emphasizes the importance of multiple complementary imaging modalities and the efficacy of a direct surgical approach, which allowed resolution of symptoms.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Prevention of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage, a serious and sometimes fatal complication remains the cornerstone for successful neurosurgical procedures. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis whether vigilant rehemostasis challenged by ketamine or hypervolemia-induced hemodynamic stress could minimize postoperative hemorrhage.

   METHODS: During a five-year period between 1995 and 2000, in an interventional study, 37 patients having parasagittal or parafalcian meningiomas were randomly allocated into three groups. After accomplishing tumor resection and securing initial surgical hemostasis, the patients received one of the following treatment regimens, i.e. group 1, 1.5 mg/kg of ketamine given intravenously, group II, 1 liter of isotonic saline, and group III, as the control group receiving conventional maintenance fluids intraoperatively, and in all the three groups, the time consumed to achieve rehemostasis at the tumor bed was recorded. Twenty four hours later, a brain computed tomogram was obtained to evaluate the hematoma volume to tumor volume ratio and extent of perifocal edema and the results were recorded.

   RESULTS: The calculated hematoma volume to tumor volume ratio and the edema score in the ketamine group was significantly less than the control group (P < 0.05). These measurements were also less in the hypervolemia group compared with the control group although the differences were not statistically significant. The rehemostasis time was also significantly more in the ketamine group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The postoperative hospital stay however, was significantly shorter in the ketamine group (P < 0.05). On the other hand the occurrence of postoperative edema was significantly less in the ketamine group (P = 0.02) compared with the control group.

   CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded from our data that, vigilant rehemostasis challenged by ketamine or hypervolemia-induced hemodynamic stress minimizes postoperative hemorrhage without producing troublesome brain edema.

Abstract
  OBJECT: Hypervolemia and hypertension therapy is routinely used for prophylaxis and treatment of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm at many institutions. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate about the preferred modality (hypervolemia, hypertension, or both), the degree of therapy (moderate or aggressive), and the risk or benefit of hypervolemia, moderate hypertension, and aggressive hypertension in patients following subarachnoid hemorrhage.

   METHODS: Monitoring data and patient charts for 45 patients were retrospectively searched to identify periods of hypervolemia, moderate hypertension, or aggressive hypertension. Measurements of central venous pressure, fluid input, urine output, arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and oxygen partial pressure (PO2) in the brain tissue were extracted from periods ranging from 1 hour to 24 hours. For these periods, the change in brain tissue PO2 and the incidence of complications were analyzed. During the 55 periods of moderate hypertension, an increase in brain tissue PO2 was found in 50 cases (90%), with complications occurring in three patients (8%). During the 25 periods of hypervolemia, an increase in brain oxygenation was found during three intervals (12%), with complications occurring in nine patients (53%). During the 10 periods of aggressive hypervolemic hypertension, an increase in brain oxygenation was found during six of the intervals (60%), with complications in five patients (50%).

   CONCLUSIONS: When hypervolemia treatment is applied as in this study, it may be associated with increased risks. Note, however, that further studies are needed to determine the role of this therapeutic modality in the care of patients with cerebral vasospasm. In poor-grade patients, moderate hypertension (cerebral perfusion pressure 80-120 mm Hg) in a normovolemic, hemodiluted patient is an effective method of improving cerebral oxygenation and is associated with a lower complication rate compared with hypervolemia or aggressive hypertension therapy.

Abstract
  The acute and persistent increase of the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) above 25 cm H2O represents a pathologic entity called the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). This intra-abdominal high pressure is responsible of dysfunctions in cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems and also dysfunctions in brain and abdomen. In polytrauma patients with combined head and abdominal lesions, increases of IAP are transmitted via thorax and superior venous caval system to brain generating intracranial hypertension, reducing cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) thus worsening neurological status and increasing mortality. A better prognosis for this polytrauma patients is possible only by elucidating the mechanisms which produces the dysfunctions in ACS and by promoting an aggressive therapeutical surgical approach.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Mounting evidence suggests that mild to moderate hypothermia can mitigate neurologic and myocardial injury. The speed of induction appears to be a key factor in determining its efficacy. However, even when the fastest currently available cooling techniques are used, reaching target temperatures takes at least 2 hrs and usually longer. We hypothesized that infusion of refrigerated fluids could be a safe accessory method to increase cooling speed.

   DESIGN: Prospective intervention study.

   SETTING: University teaching hospital.

   PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-four patients with various types of neurologic injury (postanoxic encephalopathy, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or traumatic brain injury).

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hypothermia was induced in 134 patients with various types of neurologic injury, by means ice-water cooling blankets and infusion of refrigerated (4 degrees C) saline (110 patients) or saline and colloids (24 patients). An average volume of 2340 +/- 890 mL of refrigerated fluids was infused in 50 mins. Core temperatures decreased from 36.9 +/- 1.9 degrees C to 34.6 +/- 1.5 degrees C at t = 30 mins and to 32.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C at t = 60 mins (target temperature: 32 degrees C-33 degrees C). Monitoring of blood pressure, heart rhythm, central venous pressure, blood gasses, electrolyte and glucose levels, and platelet and white blood cell count revealed no additional adverse effects. Mean arterial pressure increased by 15 mm Hg, with larger increases in blood pressure occurring in hemodynamically unstable patients. No patient developed pulmonary edema.

   CONCLUSIONS: Induction of hypothermia by means of cold-fluid infusion combined with ice-water cooling blankets is safe, efficacious, and quick. Because the speed of cooling is important to increase its protective effects, we recommend that cold-fluid infusion be used in all patients treated with induced hypothermia. This should be combined with another method to safely and accurately maintain hypothermia once target temperatures have been reached.

Abstract
  The pathophysiology of PTS including idiopathic intracranial hypertension or 'BIH', remains controversial. The older literature frequently referred to pathology in the cerebral venous drainage but more modern imaging techniques (CT and early MR) failed to reveal gross venous pathology. The role of impaired cranial venous outflow has recently been re-examined in the light of new methods of investigation (advanced MR venography and direct microcatheter venography with manometry) and of treatment (venous sinus stenting). Venous sinus obstruction in PTS is a more common factor in the pathogenesis of the condition than previously recognised. Venous obstruction may be primary, that is, it is the underlying aetiological factor in PTS. Venous sinus obstruction may also be secondary to raised CSF pressure which may exacerbate problems with intracranial compliance and raised CSF pressure. Early experience with venous stenting suggests that it may be a helpful treatment for patients with PTS but more experience and longer follow-up is required to define the subgroups of patients for whom it is most appropriate.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Venous drainage patterns are a major determinant of clinical outcome in intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) patients. In this study, we sought to identify MR imaging finding differences between DAVF types classified on the basis of venous drainage patterns.

   METHODS: Twenty-seven patients diagnosed as having DAVFs by conventional angiography were included. Medical records (n = 27), and MR imaging (n = 27) and MR angiography (MRA; n = 11) findings were retrospectively reviewed. MR imaging findings included flow void cluster, engorged ophthalmic vein/proptosis, white matter hyperintensity, intracranial hemorrhage, dilated leptomeningeal or medullary vessels, venous pouch, and leptomeningeal or medullary vascular enhancements. MRA findings included identifiable fistula, venous flow-related enhancement, and prominent extracranial vessels. Patients' presentations and MR imaging findings were compared among angiographic type I, II, and III cases (according to Borden's classification), and MRA findings were compared between cases with and without retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage (RLVD).

   RESULTS: Patient presentations were aggressive in one (13%) of the type I cases, 5 (50%) of the type II cases, and 8 (100%) of the type III cases (P = .002). Aggressive presentations included hemorrhage, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, intracranial hypertension, and an altered mental status. MR images showed significantly higher frequencies of dilated leptomeningeal or medullary vessels in a higher type [0 in type I, 5 (42%) in type II, and 7 (100%) in type III], and of leptomeningeal or medullary vascular enhancements [0 in type I, 4 (33%) in type II, and 7 (100%) in type III]. By using MRA, fistulas were identified only in cases with RLVD (5 [83%]). Venous flow-related enhancement was present in 10 cases (91%). A sole false-negative case on MRA, as compared with conventional angiography, resulted from nonvisualization of the slow venous flow (8%). No false-positive fistula was found at the other intracranial sites in all cases. Overall, MRA assessment for DAVF was adequate for both fistula and venous flow-related enhancement in 10 cases (91%) and inadequate in a remaining case because of the fistular location out of field.

   CONCLUSION: MR imaging demonstration of leptomeningeal or medullary vascular dilation and enhancements may be associated with features that are considered predictors of a poor outcome and indicates a need for urgent therapy in intracranial dural AVF patients. MRA is a complementary tool for the identification of dural AVF with venous flow-related enhancement.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Hydrocephalus with normal intracranial pressure has rarely been reported to result in herniation.

   METHODS: Case report.

   RESULTS: A 52-year-old man became acutely comatose with extensor posturing and ventriculomegaly 17 days after experiencing a primary ventricular hemorrhage. An external ventricular drain revealed normal intracranial pressure. After 24 hours without improvement with the drain set at a level of 5 mm H2O, negative-pressure siphoning (50 mL of cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] removed) reduced ventricular size and led to dramatic clinical recovery.

   CONCLUSION: Normal pressure hydrocephalus can result in delayed brainstem herniation after ventricular hemorrhage. CSF siphoning in these patients can reverse the syndrome.

Abstract
  This study was conducted to determine if the long-term administration of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor, DA-8159, to diabetic rats can ameliorate the development of erectile dysfunction (ED) and endothelial dysfunction. After inducing diabetes with streptozotocin, DA-8159 was orally administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for 8 weeks. To examine the effect on erectile response, electrostimulation of the cavernous nerve with the parameters of 3 V, 5 ms, 5 Hz or 10 Hz, was performed to measure the intracavernous pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Thoracic aorta relaxation in vitro was evaluated by adding acetylcholine (Ach) cumulatively to the bathing medium. In addition, the plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels were measured in order to investigate the effect of DA-8159 on endothelial dysfunction. The area under the curve (AUC) from the ICP/MAP ratio in the 10 Hz stimulation showed a significantly increased AUC after the 10 mg/kg treatment compared with the diabetic group (8891 +/- 619 vs. 6316 +/- 1016, respectively, p < 0.05). At the 5 Hz frequency, DA-8159 10 mg/kg also induced a significant increase in the AUC compared with the diabetic control. The maximum ICP/MAP ratio (%) of the 10 mg/kg treatment group was significantly higher in both the 10 Hz and 5 Hz frequency groups (p < 0.05). A treatment of 3 mg/kg tended to increase the AUC and peak ICP/MAP but was not statistically significant. The Ach EC50 value of the diabetic group was significantly higher than in the normal control (120.50 +/- 22.90 nm vs. 86.80 +/- 9.30 nm, respectively), and 10 mg/kg treatment group showed a significantly lower EC(50) value (88.38 +/- 19.7 nm). The ET-1 level was lower in groups treated with DA-8159, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg treatment induced a statistical difference compared with the diabetic control (1.15 +/- 0.34 fmol/mL vs. 2.51 +/- 0.55 fmol/mL, respectively, p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that chronic administration of DA-8159 could attenuate the development of the ED in diabetes and its effect is associated with an improvement in the endothelial function.

Abstract
  We report a case of benign intracranial hypertension in a 31-year-old man treated by endovascular stent placement in the right transverse sinus. The patient presented with a typical benign intracranial hypertension syndrome. Ophthalmologic findings showed bilateral papilledema with a 7/10 loss visual acuity loss in the right eye and 2/10 in the left eye. At lumbar puncture, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 40 mmHg. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed slit ventricles and dilatation of optic nerve sheaths. optiques. After failure of medical treatment, the patient was referred to our neurosurgical department for therapeutic decision. Direct retrograde cerebral venography showed predominant cerebral venous drainage via the right transverse sinus which exhibited stenosis in its proximal third. Mamometry revealed a 25 mmHg pressure gradient across the point of stenosis. Due to possible venogenic benign intracranial hypertension, endovascular stent placement was proposed and accepted by the patient. At 3 months follow-up, the patient was symptoms free, papilledema had disappeared and visual acuity was 10/10 on both eyes. CSF pressure on lumbar puncture was 11 mmHg. The pathophysiological aspects and therapeutic management of this pathology illustrated by this are discussed along with a careful and exhaustive review of the literature. [References: 22]

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical features and prognosis of cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis (CVT) in elderly patients have not been previously described.

   METHODS: In a multicenter prospective observational study, we compared clinical and imaging features, risk factors, and outcome of adult patients aged <65 (young and middle-aged patients) and > or =65 years (elderly patients).

   RESULTS: A total of 624 adult patients with CVT were registered and followed-up for a median of 16 months. Fifty-one (8.2%) were aged > or =65 years. Presentation as an isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome was less frequent in elderly patients (4/51 versus 139/573, P=0.008), whereas depressed consciousness (17 versus 97, P=0.005), and mental status changes (22 versus 115, P=0.001) were more frequent in the elderly. The prognosis of elderly patients was considerably worse than that of younger patients, as only 49% of elderly patients made a complete recovery (versus 82% in younger patients), whereas 27% died and 22% were dependent at the end of follow-up (versus 7 and 2% respectively in younger patients). Carcinoma (5 cases) was more frequent as a risk factor for CVT in elderly patients (P=0.017). During follow-up, elderly patients were more likely to experience thrombotic events (HR=4.8, 95% CI=1.9 to 11.9) and were less likely to experience severe headaches (HR=0.2, 95% CI=0.02, 0.97).

   CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with CVT have a distinctive clinical presentation: isolated intracranial hypertension is uncommon, whereas mental status and alertness disturbances are common. The prognosis of CVT is worse in elderly patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: A novel device, the intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR), combines an inspiratory impedance threshold device (ITD) with a vacuum source for the generation of controlled -10 mm Hg vacuum in the trachea during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while allowing positive pressure ventilation. Compared with standard (STD) CPR, ITPR-CPR will enhance venous return, systemic arterial pressure, and vital organ perfusion in both porcine models of ventricular fibrillation and hypovolemic cardiac arrest.

   METHODS AND RESULTS: In protocol 1, 20 pigs (weight, 30+/-0.5 kg) were randomized to STD-CPR or ITPR-CPR. After 8 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation, CPR was performed for 6 minutes at 100 compressions per minute and positive pressure ventilation (100% O2) with a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 15:2. In protocol 2, 6 animals were bled 50% of their blood volume. After 4 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation, interventions were performed for 2 minutes with STD-CPR and 2 minutes of ITPR-CPR. This sequence was repeated. In protocol 3, 6 animals after 8 minutes of untreated VF were treated with ITPR-CPR for 15 minutes, and arterial and venous blood gases were collected at baseline and minutes 5, 10, and 15 of CPR. A newer, leak-proof ITPR device was used. Aortic, right atrial, endotracheal pressure, intracranial pressure, and end-tidal CO2 values were measured (mm Hg); common carotid arterial flow also was measured (mL/min). Coronary perfusion pressure (diastolic; aortic minus right atrial pressure) and cerebral perfusion pressure (mean arterial minus mean intracranial pressure) were calculated. Unpaired Student t test and Friedman's repeated-measures ANOVA of ranks were used in protocols 1 and 3. A 2-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for analysis in protocol 2. Fischer's exact test was used for survival. Significance was set at P<0.05. Vital organ perfusion pressures and end-tidal CO2 were significantly improved with ITPR-CPR in both protocols. In protocol 1, 1-hour survival was 100% with ITPR-CPR and 10% with STD-CPR (P=0.001). Arterial blood pH was significantly lower and Paco2 was significantly higher with ITPR-CPR in protocol 1. Arterial oxygen saturation was 100% throughout the study in both protocols. Paco2 and Pao2 remained stable, but metabolic acidosis progressed, as expected, throughout the 15 minutes of CPR in protocol 3.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with STD-CPR, use of ITPR-CPR improved hemodynamics and short-term survival rates after cardiac arrest.

Abstract
  In this study the hemodynamic status and treatment modality of aggressive dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) was evaluated. Of 145 intracranial dAVFs treated in our clinic, there were 38 aggressive lesions presenting with hemorrhage, infarction, seizures, and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. They included 3 (5% of all cavernous sinus lesions) cavernous sinus, 24 (44%) transverse-sigmoid and superior sagittal sinus, and 11 (46%) direct cortical types of dAVFs. Of these 38 aggressive lesions, retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage was disclosed in 35 lesions, and retrograde sinus drainage in 3. Eighteen cases were treated only with endovascular procedures, 7 with surgical interventions, and 13 with combined endovascular and surgical procedures. Angiographic results were complete obliteration in 66% of the cases, subtotal and partial obliteration in 34%. Clinical outcome was GR (good recovery) in 58% of cases, MD (moderate disability) in 18%, SD (severe disability) in 13%, VS (vegetative state) in 8%, and D (death) (due to acute cardiac infarction) in 3%. Symptomatic procedural complication occurred in 3 cases. In conclusion, aggressive dural AVF resulted from retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage. Combined surgical and endovascular treatment played the leading part in the management of this aggressive type of lesion.

Abstract
  Significant progress has been made in understanding the production,circulation, and absorption of CSF. In part because of autoregulation, rapid changes in arterial pressure produce parallel but significantly dampened changes in CSF pressure. Chronic arterial hypertension rarely affects ICP,but changes in venous pressure are transmitted directly into the CSF, taking precedence over arterial effects. An understanding of basic CSF physiology,particularly in relation to ICP homeostasis, is important for surgeons treating intracranial hypertension, low ICP pressure, and spontaneous,traumatic, or iatrogenic CSF leakages. The principles discussed in this article are valuable to remember when planning surgical procedures in the head and neck, both to prevent and to treat potential complications related to increased or decreased CSF pressure.

Abstract
  The authors describe an infant with abnormal development of the cerebral venous system associated with in utero ventriculomegaly and perinatal hemorrhage. When the patient was 6 weeks of age progressive ventriculomegaly followed by cerebrospinal fluid diversion resulted in tumefaction of the dural sinuses, intravascular thrombosis, and a coagulopathy. Oral anticoagulation therapy safely reversed the coagulopathy. Serial neuroimaging findings in this unique cascade of pathophysiological events indicated that, despite decreased intracranial pressure after shunt placement, local hemodynamic factors increased the venous resistance to flow and prolonged the transit time. Long-term anticoagulation therapy was associated with improvements in flow, transit time, and tumefaction.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Resection of the internal jugular vein can be necessary in cases of radical neck dissection or even in cases involving benign neoplasms such as glomus tumors. According to the triad described by Virchow (ie, stasis of blood flow, damage to the endothelium, and changes in hemostasis), the development of a thrombosis in the venous vessels superior to the resected internal jugular vein seems to be possible. The aim of this study was to determine the extension of possible intracranial thrombosis after wound healing.

   DESIGN: A total of 17 patients requiring resection of the internal jugular vein were evaluated prospectively using magnetic resonance imaging and 2-dimensional (time-of-flight) magnetic resonance angiography after the surgical treatment. Preoperative magnetic resonance images were obtained in all 17 patients for staging purposes as well as to exclude preoperative thrombosis of the internal jugular vein. Sixteen patients had malignant tumors, and 1 patient had a glomus tumor.

   RESULTS: Intracranial thrombosis with thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus was found in 4 patients, and thrombosis of the transverse sinus was found in 3 patients. There were no complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or signs of increased intracranial pressure in any patients. There was no evidence of intracranial thrombosis in 10 cases. In these cases, thrombosis of the venous vessels superior to the resected vein ranged from none to complete thrombosis of the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. After unilateral resection of the internal jugular vein, the venous blood leaves the brain mainly via the venous network of the contralateral side of the neck.

   CONCLUSIONS: Although intracranial thrombosis of the sigmoid or transverse sinus seems to occur more frequently than was previously thought, intracranial complications such as venous infarction or increased intracranial pressure appear to be very rare. After unilateral radical neck dissection, the venous blood leaves the brain mainly via the venous system of the other side of the neck and the ipsilateral collateral veins.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because venous hypertension determines the clinical severity of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs), evaluation of intracranial venous pressure is important in making decisions concerning treatment. We determined whether intracranial venous hypertension could be quantified by using an acetazolamide test in a manner that indicates whether treatment of the DAVF is necessary.

   METHODS: We enrolled 21 untreated patients: 11 with a sigmoid and/or transverse DAVF, six with a cavernous DAVF, two with an anterior cranial fossa DAVF, and two with a superior sagittal sinus DAVF. Cerebral hemodynamics were studied with stable-xenon CT. Patients were angiographically classified into three groups, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after acetazolamide challenge was compared between angiographic groups, between patients with and those without symptoms attributable to intracranial venous hypertension, and between preembolization and postembolization examinations.

   RESULTS: A high angiographic grade was associated with decreased resting rCBF and a blunted response to acetazolamide. Response to acetazolamide was more sensitive to venous hypertension, as angiographically assessed, than decreased resting rCBF. Resting rCBF and the increase in rCBF associated with acetazolamide were significantly lower in the symptomatic group than in the asymptomatic group. Treatment of the DAVF significantly enhanced the increased rCBF due to the acetazolamide challenge.

   CONCLUSION: Cerebral venous hypertension in DAVF reduced the response to acetazolamide, as shown on stable-Xe CT. Therefore, a patient with DAVF and a reduced rCBF response to acetazolamide requires treatment irrespective of his or her symptoms.

Abstract
  Venous outlet obstruction has recently been reported to be a potentially treatable cause of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). In the English-language literature only 18 cases, all from the UK and Australia, involving the use of transverse sinus stenosis stent treatment for BIH have been reported; the youngest patient to receive treatment was a 17-year-old girl. The authors report the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with headache, papilledema, decreased visual acuity, and diploplia who underwent successful unilateral transverse sinus stenosis stenting and experienced complete resolution of symptoms.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Chiari malformation (CM) is a frequent finding in multisutural and syndromic craniosynostosis, occurring in 70% of patients with Crouzon's syndrome, 75% with oxycephaly, 50% with Pfeiffer's syndrome and 100% with the Kleeblattschadel deformity. The pathogenesis of this condition and rationale for treatment are still controversial.

   DISCUSSION: Since its first description in 1972, several factors have been cited to play a role in inducing CM. In the light of recent publications, the roles of premature fusion of cranial vault and cranial base sutures, of congenital anomalies of the cerebellum and brain stem, of raised intracranial pressure, of venous hypertension and of hydrocephalus are reviewed. Evaluation and management of CM are also discussed.

   CONCLUSION: Chiari malformation appears to be an acquired and progressive condition that develops in the first months of life, because of a disproportion between hindbrain growth and an abnormally small posterior fossa, a consequence of the premature fusion of lambdoid and cranial base sutures. Venous hypertension caused by stenosis of the jugular foramen can also be present in these patients, resulting in intracranial hypertension and/or hydrocephalus. Careful MRI evaluation is recommended for the forms of craniosynostosis at a high risk of developing hindbrain herniation. The selection of posterior cranial vault expansion as the first surgical procedure is advocated. In selected cases, treatment of the posterior cranial deformity by occipital vault remodelling and treatment of the Chiari-like deformity by suboccipital decompression can be carried out using the same surgical procedure.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend a compression-to-ventilation ratio (C/V ratio) of 15:2 during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for out-of-the-hospital cardiac arrest. Recent data have shown that frequent ventilations are unnecessary and may be harmful during CPR, since each positive-pressure ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure and may increase intracranial pressure and decrease venous blood return to the right heart and thereby decrease both the cerebral and coronary perfusion pressures.

   HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that reducing the ventilation rate by increasing the C/V ratio from 15:2 to 15:1 will increase vital-organ perfusion pressures without compromising oxygenation and acid-base balance.

   METHODS: Direct-current ventricular fibrillation was induced in 8 pigs. After 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation without ventilation, all animals received 4 min of standard CPR with a C/V ratio of 15:2. Animals were then randomized to either (A) a C/V ratio of 15:1 and then 15:2, or (B) a C/V ratio of 15:2 and then 15:1, for 3 min each. During CPR, ventilations were delivered with an automatic transport ventilator, with 100% oxygen. Right atrial pressure, intratracheal pressure (a surrogate for intrathoracic pressure), aortic pressure, and intracranial pressure were measured. Coronary perfusion pressure was calculated as diastolic aortic pressure minus right atrial pressure. Cerebral perfusion pressure was calculated as mean aortic pressure minus mean intracranial pressure. Arterial blood gas values were obtained at the end of each intervention. A paired t test was used for statistical analysis, and a p value < 0.05 was considered significant.

   RESULTS: The mean +/- SEM values over 1 min with either 15:2 or 15:1 C/V ratios were as follows: intratracheal pressure 0.93 +/- 0.3 mm Hg versus 0.3 +/- 0.28 mm Hg, p = 0.006; coronary perfusion pressure 10.1 +/- 4.5 mm Hg versus 19.3 +/- 3.2 mm Hg, p = 0.007; intracranial pressure 25.4 +/- 2.7 mm Hg versus 25.7 +/- 2.7 mm Hg, p = NS; mean arterial pressure 33.1 +/- 3.7 mm Hg versus 40.2 +/- 3.6 mm Hg, p = 0.007; cerebral perfusion pressure 7.7 +/- 6.2 mm Hg versus 14.5 +/- 5.5 mm Hg, p = 0.008. Minute area intratracheal pressure was 55 +/- 17 mm Hg . s versus 22.3 +/- 10 mm Hg . s, p < 0.001. End-tidal CO(2) with 15:2 versus 15:1 was 24 +/- 3.6 mm Hg versus 29 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, respectively, p = 0.001. Arterial blood gas values were not significantly changed with 15:2 versus 15:1 C/V ratios: pH 7.28 +/- 0.03 versus 7.3 +/- 0.03; P(aCO(2)) 37.7 +/- 2.9 mm Hg versus 37.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg; and P(aO(2)) 274 +/- 36 mm Hg versus 303 +/- 51 mm Hg.

   CONCLUSIONS: In a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, reducing the ventilation frequency during CPR by increasing the C/V ratio from 15:2 to 15:1 resulted in improved vital-organ perfusion pressures, higher end-tidal CO(2) levels, and no change in arterial oxygen content or acid-base balance.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: This article addresses the relevance of venous hypertension to children born with, in particular, the "syndromic" forms of craniosynostosis. The development of the human cerebral venous system is summarised and the patterns of anomalous venous drainage seen in children with complex forms of craniosynostosis associated with raised intracranial pressure are described.

   AETIOLOGY: The aetiology of these abnormal patterns is discussed under the general headings of "The constriction theory", "A primary role for FGFR mutations" and "Persistence of the foetal pattern of intracranial venous drainage."Venous hypertension (along with hydrocephalus, cranio-cerebral disproportion and airway obstruction) has an important role in the aetiology of raised intracranial pressure in severely affected children.

   TREATMENT: The inter-relationship between these factors is explained and then the treatment of those children whose raised intracranial pressure is considered to be due predominantly to venous hypertension is described. [References: 36]

Abstract
  Loss of consciousness due to central hypovolemia can occur due to sudden cardiovascular decompensation in normal individuals or hypovolemic shock in wounded patients. A variety of devices have been developed to sustain perfusion to the brain including anti-G suits worn by pilots and returning astronauts and applied to patients as "shock trousers." However, all countermeasures developed to date suffer from problems that limit their utility in the field. An "impedance threshold device" (ITD) has recently been developed that acutely increases central blood volume by forcing the thoracic muscles to develop increased negative pressure, thus drawing venous blood from extrathoracic cavities into the heart and lungs. We review here a series of experiments that demonstrate the application of the ITD to a variety of experimental conditions, including its use to: 1) increase heart rate, stroke volume, and arterial BP in normovolemia and hypovolemia; 2) increase cerebral blood flow velocity; 3) reset cardiac baroreflex function to a higher operating range for BP; 4) lower intracranial pressure; and 5) reduce orthostatic symptoms. In this brief review, we present evidence which supports further consideration of using inspiratory resistance as a countermeasure against circulatory collapse associated with orthostatic instability and hemorrhagic shock.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Since its first description by Virchow, the principle of abnormal skull growth due to restriction of skull growth at the fused sutures, and the realisation by Moss that the sutures at the skull base are equally affected, have been the main intellectual driving forces behind the majority of cranial expansion procedures performed currently in children with craniosynostosis.

   CURRENT OBSERVATIONS: Despite original impressions that craniosynostosis leads to craniostenosis, many studies have demonstrated that in the majority of patients with craniosynostosis there is normal skull volume in those over the age of 6 months. In Apert syndrome, skull volume is invariably larger than normal. Some studies have shown that intracranial pressure is independent of intracranial volume, and can exist in the presence of normal volume, or indeed after cranial expansion. These observations imply that cranial expansion procedures create a state of artificially increased skull volume, in the quest to improve appearance and function.

   FUTURE ADVANCES: This creates a new angle of view through which skull growth abnormalities are seen. It is becoming clearer that in most patients with craniosynostosis, there is regional imbalance of skull growth, which co-exists with a variety of other equally important factors, such as genetic defects, raised intracranial pressure, venous hypertension, and other brain parenchymal anomalies such as hindbrain hernia or hydrocephalus. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the type of surgical treatment currently practised in most cases is conceptually incorrect. Recent modifications such as the use of springs or distraction do not escape from the underlying philosophy of cranial expansion. With that in mind, it is hoped that advances in the fields of genetics and molecular biology will provide treatments for the cause of craniosynostosis rather than the symptomatic relief that surgery offers currently.

   CONCLUSION: Until then, there is a need to develop better ways of quantifying regional abnormalities of skull growth. [References: 123]

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be effective in improving oxygenation, but it may worsen or induce intracranial hypertension. The authors hypothesized that the intracranial effects of PEEP could be related to the changes in respiratory system compliance (Crs).

   METHODS: A prospective study investigated 21 comatose patients with severe head injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage receiving intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring who required mechanical ventilation and PEEP. The 13 patients with normal Crs were analyzed as group A and the 8 patients with low Crs as group B. During the study, 0, 5, 8, and 12 cm H2O of PEEP were applied in a random sequence. Jugular pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral compliance, mean velocity of the middle cerebral arteries, and jugular oxygen saturation were evaluated simultaneously.

   RESULTS: In the group A patients, the PEEP increase from 0 to 12 cm H2O significantly increased CVP (from 10.6 +/- 3.3 to 13.8 +/- 3.3 mm Hg; p < 0.001) and jugular pressure (from 16.6 +/- 3.1 to 18.8 +/- 3.2 mm Hg; p < 0.001), but reduced mean arterial pressure (from 96.3 +/- 6.7 to 91.3 +/- 6.5 mm Hg; p < 0.01), CPP (from 82.2 +/- 6.9 to 77.0 +/- 6.2 mm Hg; p < 0.01), and mean velocity of the middle cerebral arteries (from 73.1 +/- 27.9 to 67.4 +/- 27.1 cm/sec; F = 7.15; p < 0.001). No significant variation in these parameters was observed in group B patients. After the PEEP increase, ICP and cerebral compliance did not change in either group. Although jugular oxygen saturation decreased slightly, it in no case dropped below 50%.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with low Crs, PEEP has no significant effect on cerebral and systemic hemodynamics. Monitoring of Crs may be useful for avoiding deleterious effects of PEEP on the intracranial system of patients with normal Crs.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Recent data suggest that generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during the decompression phase of CPR improves hemodynamics, organ perfusion and survival.

   HYPOTHESIS: Incomplete chest wall recoil during the decompression phase of standard CPR increases intrathoracic pressure and right atrial pressure, impedes venous return, decreases compression-induced aortic pressures and results in a decrease of mean arterial pressure, coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure.

   METHODS: Nine pigs in ventricular fibrillation (VF) for 6 min, were treated with an automated compression/decompression device with a compression rate of 100 min(-1), a depth of 25% of the anterior-posterior diameter, and a compression to ventilation ratio of 15:2 with 100% decompression (standard CPR) for 3 min. Compression was then reduced to 75% of complete decompression for 1 min of CPR and then restored for another 1 min of CPR to 100% full decompression. Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated as the diastolic (aortic (Ao)-right atrial (RA) pressure). Cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP) was calculated multiple ways: (1) the positive area (in mmHg s) between aortic pressure and intracranial pressure (ICP) waveforms, (2) the coincident difference in systolic and diastolic aortic and intracranial pressures (mmHg), and (3) CerPP = MAP--ICP. ANOVA was used for statistical analysis and all values were expressed as mean +/- S.E.M. The power of the study for an alpha level of significance set at 0.05 was >0.90.

   RESULTS: With CPR performed with 100%-75%-100% of complete chest wall recoil, respectively, the CPP was 23.3 +/- 1.9, 15.1 +/- 1.6, 16.6 +/- 1.9, p = 0.003; CerPP was: (1) area: 313.8 +/- 104, 89.2 +/- 39, 170.5 +/- 42.9, p = 0.03, (2) systolic aortic minus intracranial pressure difference: 22.8 +/- 3.6, 16.5 +/- 4, 23.7 +/- 4.5, p = n.s., and diastolic pressure difference: 5.7 +/- 3, -2.4 +/- 2.4, 3.2 +/- 2.5, p = 0.04 and (3) mean: 14.3 +/- 3, 7 +/- 2.9, 12.4 +/- 2.9, p = 0.03, diastolic aortic pressure was 28.1 +/- 2.5, 20.7 +/- 1.9, 20.9 +/- 2.1, p = 0.0125; ICP during decompression was 22.8 +/- 1.7, 23 +/- 1.5, 19.7 +/- 1.7, p = n.s. and mean ICP was 37.1 +/- 2.3, 35.5 +/- 2.2, 35.2 +/- 2.4, p = n.s.; RA diastolic pressure 4.8 +/- 1.3, 5.6 +/- 1.2, 4.3 +/- 1.2 p = 0.1; MAP was 52 +/- 2.9, 43.3 +/- 3, 48.3 +/- 2.9, p = 0.04; decompression endotracheal pressure, -0.7 +/- 0.1, -0.3 +/- 0.1, -0.75 +/- 0.1, p = 0.045.

   CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete chest wall recoil during the decompression phase of CPR increases endotracheal pressure, impedes venous return and decreases mean arterial pressure, and coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures.

Abstract
  CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old female born with a thoracic level myelomeningocele, Chiari II malformation, and hydrocephalus treated at birth developed clinical features of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to shunt malfunction. The patient became comatose. Her ICP remained high despite a functioning shunt and even after the ventricular catheter was exteriorized. Diagnostic imaging consistently demonstrated slit-like ventricles, a Chiari II malformation, and a tethered spinal cord. We attributed her neurological condition either to brainstem compression or increased ICP related to venous outlet obstruction at the foramen magnum.

   OUTCOME: The patient improved rapidly after undergoing a Chiari II decompression and placement of a shunt from the cisterna magna and upper cervical subarachnoid space to the peritoneum connected by a "Y" connector to the ventricular catheter.

   CONCLUSION: The complex hydrocephalus was effectively treated by this concurrent ventricular and cisterna magna-to-peritoneum shunt.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Continuous measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) requires the invasive placement of epidural, parenchymal, or intraventricular devices. For critical single-point assessments, lumbar puncture may not always be practical. An accurate, reliable, portable and noninvasive method to estimate absolute ICP remains an elusive goal. The arteries that perfuse and the vein that drains the orbit are exposed to the ambient ICP while coursing through the cerebrospinal fluid or optic nerve.

   METHODS: The venous outflow pressure (VOP) of the central retinal vein was measured using occlusion in six intensive care patients treated for acute hydrocephalus or brain hemorrhage and in whom transducers of intracranial pressure could provide standardized continuous output. A novel adaptation of the Balliart ophthalmodynamometer was developed for use. Simultaneously, the central retinal (CRA) and ophthalmic (OA) arterial flow velocities were recorded using color Doppler imaging technique. Repeat noninvasive measurements were performed at various ICPs, (n=22 independently collected observations). Linear regression and correlation testing were performed to evaluate these variables for ICP predictability.

   RESULTS: The VOP increased linearly with ICP (r=0.87). The arterial pulsatility indices for both OA and CRA decreased inversely with ICP (r=0.66). An empiric index combining both venous and arterial parameters (VOP/Gosling Pulsatility Index [GPI]) was significantly more correlated with absolute ICP than either parameter alone (r=0.95, p<0.005, ICP=0.29+0.74 [VOP/GPI(OA)]).

   CONCLUSION: The feasibility to estimate ICP from transocular sonographic and dynamometric data is suggested by these preliminary data. Retinal arterial properties are important in modeling the effect of ICP on the venous outflow pressure. Our pilot results serve as a basis on which to conduct a larger prospective and blinded study.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: It is common neurosurgical wisdom that depressed cranial fractures (DCFs) over the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) should not be elevated because of the risk of fatal venous hemorrhage.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old man presented with severe headache and diplopia after a motor vehicle accident. Clinical examination demonstrated severe papilledema and bilateral abducens palsy. Imaging findings demonstrated a DCF over the posterior third of the SSS and absent flow distal to the fracture with dilated cortical venous drainage.

   INTERVENTION: Conservative treatment with acetazolamide only partially alleviated the patient's headache and diplopia. Definitive surgical treatment via elevation of the DCF was discussed and decided upon. Twelve days after injury, the patient underwent midline parieto-occipital craniotomy with successful elevation of the DCF off the posterior third of the SSS. Postoperative magnetic resonance venograms revealed restoration of patency in the SSS with reduced tortuosity of cortical veins. The patient's headache resolved, and his papilledema and diplopia resolved gradually.

   CONCLUSION: Elevation of DCF over the SSS can be attempted in cases in which favorable bone anatomy and the patient's clinical condition warrant. This may result in rapid and dramatic resolution of signs and symptoms of secondary intracranial hypertension.

Abstract
  Postural medicine studies the effects of gravity on human body functions and the ability to influence various diseases by changing the body's position. Orthostasis requires numerous cardiovascular and neurohumoral adaptations to prevent hypotension and a resulting decrease in cerebral perfusion. Sitting upright or in a semi-sitting position reduces venous return in patients with heart failure, intracranial pressure in patients with intracranial hypertension, intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients and may decrease gastro-oesophageal reflux. A left recumbent posture also decreases reflux. A right lateral position results in a lower sympathetic tone than lying on the left side and is beneficial in patients with heart failure or after an infarction without bradycardia. A 40 to 70% decreased prevalence of the sudden infant death syndrome has been observed since the recommendation to avoid laying infants to sleep in a prone position. Sleeping in a supine posture increases the severity of sleep apnoea compared to a lateral position. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a prone position can rapidly improve blood oxygenation. Idiopathic oedema, orthostatic proteinuria, intradiscal pressure and venous circulation in legs are improved in the decubitus position, whereas arterial flow is reduced. Health risks due to microgravity and prolonged bed rest, such as osteoporosis, venous thrombosis or pressure sores, are discussed. [References: 85]

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review on traumatic brain injury consolidates the substantial current literature available on the pathophysiology, mechanisms, developments, and their subsequent effects on outcome. In particular, it tries to conceptualize why our greatly improved understanding of pathophysiology and neurobiology in traumatic brain injury has not translated into clear outcome improvements.

   RECENT FINDINGS: Early cerebral ischaemia has been characterized further, with ischaemic brain volume correlating with 6-month outcome. The Brain Trauma Foundation has revised perfusion pressure targets, and there are additional data on the outcome impact of brain tissue oxygen response and asymmetric patterns of cerebral autoregulation. Mechanistic studies have highlighted the role of inflammation and introduced concepts such as therapeutic vaccination and immune modulation. Experimental neurogenesis and repair strategies show promise. Despite continuing gains in knowledge, the experimental successes have not yet translated to the clinic. Indeed, several major articles have attempted to understand the clinical failure of highly promising strategies such as hypothermia, and set out the framework for further studies (e.g. addressing decompressive craniectomy). High-dose mannitol has shown promise in poor grade patients, while hypertonic saline has shown better intracranial pressure control. Negative results may be the consequence of ineffective therapies. However, there is a gathering body of work that highlights the outcome impact of subtle neurocognitive changes, which may not be quantified adequately by outcome measures used in previous trials. Such knowledge has also informed improved definition of mild traumatic brain injury, and allowed validation of management guidelines.

   SUMMARY: The evidence base for current therapies in this heterogeneous patient group is being refined, with greater emphasis on long-term functional outcomes. Improved monitoring techniques emphasize the need for individualization of therapeutic interventions. [References: 91]

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Increases in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) can cause increases in intracranial pressure (ICP). Recently, we noticed that abdominal fascial release could be useful in treating intracranial hypertension (ICH) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We added this as an option in our treatment of TBI.

   METHODS: In our institution, ICH is treated with an algorithm using osmolar therapy, CSF drainage and barbiturates. Patients with refractory ICH have routine measurement of IAP. If elevated, consideration is given to decompressive laparotomy. We retrospectively reviewed all patients admitted from January 2000 through July 2003 who had abdominal decompression to treat refractory ICH.

   RESULTS: From 1/00 to 7/03, 17 patients underwent decompressive laparotomy for intractable ICH. Thirteen male and 4 females all sustained blunt injury. All had failed maximal therapy including 14 who had had decompressive craniectomy. Mean ICP was 30 +/- 8.1 mmHg (range 20-40 mmHg) before decompression. No patients had evidence of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Before decompression mean IAP was 27.5 (+/- 5.2) mmHg (range 21-35 mmHg). After abdominal decompression ICP dropped precipitously by at least 10 mmHg to a mean of 17.5 (+/- 3.2) mmHg (range 10-25 mmHg). In 6 patients the decrease in ICP was transient. All died. The remaining 11 had sustained decreases in ICP. All survived, made neurologic recovery and were discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

   CONCLUSION: Decompressive laparotomy can be a useful adjunct in the treatment of ICH failing maximal therapy following TBI. More work will need to be done to precise the exact indications for this therapy.

Abstract
  The pressure within the abdominal cavity is normally little more than atmospheric pressure. However, even small increases in intra-abdominal pressure can have adverse effects on renal function, cardiac output, hepatic blood flow, respiratory mechanics, splanchnic perfusion and intracranial pressure. Although intra-abdominal pressure can be measured directly, this is invasive and bedside measurement of intra-abdominal pressure is usually achieved via the urinary bladder. This cheap, easy approach has been shown to produce results that correlate closely with directly measured abdominal pressures. Significant increases in intra-abdominal pressure are seen in a wide variety of conditions commonly encountered in the intensive care unit, such as ruptured aortic aneurysm, abdominal trauma and acute pancreatitis. Abdominal compartment syndrome describes the combination of increased intra-abdominal pressure and end-organ dysfunction. This syndrome has a high mortality, most deaths resulting from sepsis and multi-organ failure. Detection of abdominal compartment syndrome requires close surveillance of intra-abdominal pressure in patients thought to be at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension. The only available treatment for established abdominal compartment syndrome is decompressive laparotomy. Prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome after laparotomy by adoption of an open abdomen approach may be preferable in the patient at significant risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension, but this has not been demonstrated in any large trials. Most surgeons prefer to adopt a 'wait and see' policy, only intervening when clinical deterioration is associated with a significant increase in intra-abdominal pressure. [References: 64]

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the long-term impact of a CSF shunt on the human CSF hydrodynamic system. In patients with communicating hydrocephalus, patency of the shunt system is not regularly assessed. In order to reveal postoperative changes in the CSF hydrodynamic system, we prospectively investigated the features of the system in shunted patients with idiopathic adult hydrocephalus syndrome (IAHS) over a 3-year period.

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with IAHS were studied at baseline and at 3, 9, 18 and 36 months postoperatively. All patients were operated on with a Hakim standard valve system and a ventriculo-peritoneal approach. At each visit, the patients were investigated with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, video recording of gait and a lumbar constant pressure infusion method. Six brand-new Hakim valves were investigated in a bench test, and these results were compared with the in vivo results.

   RESULTS: After shunt insertion, the CSF outflow resistance was significantly decreased (13.6 vs 3.8 mmHg/ml/min). The mean outflow resistance of the six in vitro tested valves corresponded to the postoperative values. The variation in resistance in the functioning shunts at different postoperative investigations was negligible. The mean intracranial pressure in the supine position was 13.8 mmHg at the baseline and 14.3, 14.5, 14.8 and 15.7 mmHg at the follow-up visits, respectively. Postoperatively, the CSF pressure after sitting for 10 min (i.e. 'siphoning effect') decreased significantly (mean decrease -5.3, -5.4, -4.7 and -5.3 mmHg at each visit, respectively). Shunt-related complications occurred in seven patients (underdrainage four, overdrainage three). Despite a functioning shunt, eight patients never improved and another nine patients first improved but later deteriorated.

   CONCLUSIONS: The CSF outflow resistance is much decreased postoperatively and does not alter over time in patients with functioning shunts. We consider CSF outflow resistance to be a reliable indicator of shunt function and of fundamental importance to distinguish a dysfunctioning shunt from an aggravation of the primary condition in patients with communicating hydrocephalus. The unaltered intracranial pressure together with the in vitro model results, suggests that the intra-abdominal pressure might be a major determinant of the postoperative intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak at the lumbar puncture (LP) site may induce intracranial hypotension, a common cause of post-LP headache (LPH). We present the case of an 18-year-old man who developed a severe and continuous positional headache 24 hours after LP. CT scan and MRI showed abnormal, intense, dural venous sinus enhancement, indicating a compensatory venous expansion. The patient recovered fully within a fortnight. This report supports the hypothesis that venodilation may be involved in the pathogenesis of LPH. Brain MRI, to detect possible dural venous sinus abnormalities, should therefore be performed in patients with severe and prolonged LPH, as this may allow a prompt recognition and treatment of this disturbing condition.

Abstract
  Mechanical ventilation is necessary for treating patients with severe brain injury because it guarantees the airway (through endotracheal intubation), permits sedation (and even curarization), and prevents hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. Hyperventilation continues to be a focus of debate in the current literature. Nevertheless, the weight of scientific evidence to date suggests that it should not be applied prophylactically during the first 24 hours and that patients should not be hyperventilated for prolonged periods in the absence of intracranial hypertension. Acute lung injury and respiratory distress are among the most frequent and serious complications related to severe brain injury that benefit from the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation to protect the lung. Gas insufflation through the trachea is a promising therapeutic option for correcting hypercapnia secondary to ventilation for lung protection in such patients. Finally, multimodal monitoring (intracranial pressure, central venous pressure, oxygen saturation detected in the jugular bulb, cerebral oxygen pressure) is recommended for adjusting PEEP and controlling hyperventilation.

Abstract
  We present the usefulness of Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DWI) in diagnosis and therapeutic strategy of deep cerebral venous thrombosis (VT). We report a 37-year-old man who suffered general convulsion and deep coma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high intensity in the right caudate nuclei and bilateral thalamus on T2-weighted images. DWI showed slightly high intensity in the same area and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is normal or slightly high (0.748-1.100 x 10(-3) mm2/s). Cerebral angiography showed occlusion of straight sinus from basal veins and internal cerebral veins bilaterally. We treated by anticoagulation, ventricle drainage, barubiturate and normothermia therapy with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. We considered endovascular thrombolysis to be dangerous in this case because of hemorrhage and didn't it. ICP was more than 40 mmHg and consciousness was comatose in acute stage, however, ICP gradually got to be normal, consciousness became almost clear and he recovered. Follow-up Cerebral angiography showed recanalization of deep venous thrombosis. Follow-up MRI showed disappearance of high intensity in the right caudate nuclei and bilateral thalamus on T2-weighted images and DWI. In this case, we could predict reversible vasogenic edema by DWI and ADC in VT.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We describe a treatment protocol for patients who have a dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVF) not curable solely by an endovascular approach.

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three patients suffering from neurological impairment due to a complex dAVM (intracranial haemorrhage 2, intracranial hypertension 1) were treated by a combination of arterial embolization treatment and subsequent surgery.

   RESULTS: Marked reduction of flow was achieved by embolization of the main arterial feeders of the fistulae. Surgery eliminated the residual dAVFs completely and without permanent morbidity.

   CONCLUSION: It is necessary to eliminate a dural fistula completely, especially in a patient whose fistula had drainage or reflux into cortical veins, which have a high risk of intracranial haemorrhage and venous hypertension. We present an approach to treatment using transarterial embolization and early surgery which may offer a safe and effective way to achieve complete elimination of the lesion, avoiding increased risk to important venous drainage.

Abstract
  Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure without hydrocephalus or mass lesion and with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition. Although often considered to be "idiopathic," detailed investigation has revealed a high incidence of venous outflow abnormalities in PTC syndrome patients. The thought that elevated intracranial venous sinus pressure is a "universal mechanism" for PTC syndrome of varying etiologies has been called into question by a study indicating that the increased venous pressure in idiopathic PTC patients is caused by the elevated intracranial pressure and not the reverse, suggesting that "the chicken is the CSF pressure elevation and the egg is the venous sinus pressure elevation." Vitamin A toxicity may play a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic PTC. The treatment of PTC has two major goals: the alleviation of symptoms and preservation of visual function. When medical therapy fails or when visual dysfunction deteriorates, surgical therapies for PTC should be considered. The two main procedures performed include lumboperitoneal shunt and optic nerve sheath fenestration. Because of the association of PTC with venous sinus hypertension, some authors are considering venous sinus stenting for refractory cases of PTC. It is still unclear if primary treatment of the observed venous stenosis benefits patients with idiopathic PTC. This should be no surprise, as it is not certain whether the stenoses are the cause or the result of idiopathic PTC. [References: 53]

Abstract
  The clinical picture of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) depends on the site of thrombosis in the venous system including superficial veins, deep veins and venous sinuses. Thrombotic changes may occur simultaneously in various parts of the venous system. Since CVT may have various causes, the knowledge of its etiology helps to make the diagnosis. In systemic diseases multiple intravascular clots may result, while in localized pathological conditions thrombosis maybe restricted to the lesion site. The clinical picture is often serious, leading to death, or to severe complications such as pulmonary embolism, and to distant complications--like epilepsy or intracranial hypertension being the cause of chronic headaches (lumbar puncture and CSF pressure measurement are helpful in the diagnosis of intracranial hypertension). In order to prevent complications of crucial importance is not only the proper diagnosis (with MRI and venography as the diagnostic techniques of choice), but also an early and prolonged treatment with anticoagulants. Heparin or fractionated heparin is recommended even though there is a possibility of cerebral haemorrhagic lesions. [References: 37]

Abstract
  Cerebral venous thrombosis is a clinical condition of difficult diagnosis, and poor prognosis when treatment is not started early. There is a long list of causes, and hereby we describe a case associated to prothrombin G20210 mutation. A 53-year-old man, white, was admitted with status epilepticus. After seizures control, he developed intracranial hypertension, with headache and vomiting, and bilateral papilledema. His past medical and familial history were unremarkable. He was a nonsmoker, no drug and alcohol user. CT scan and MRI showed right temporal and parietal infarct with hemorrhagic transformation. Spinal tap with opening pressure of 500 mmH2O showed normal CSF examination. MRI angiography disclosed superior sinus, right transverse and sigmoid sinus complete thrombosis. He was started with heparin and oral warfarin. In spite of anticoagulation, two months later he developed deep right inferior limb thrombosis. All the initial tests were normal, and test for prothrombin G20210 mutation was positive. He needed a much higher than conventional daily dose of warfarin to keep him asymptomatic.

Abstract
  The authors present a 37-year-old lady with symptoms and signs suggestive of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). Routine CT and MRI scans were normal. Further investigations were performed with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and cerebral venography. These revealed obstruction of the right transverse sinus with high pressure (40 mmHg) proximal to the obstruction and low pressure (15 mmHg) distally. She was treated by transvenous stent deployment with resolution of her symptoms and the bilateral papilloedema. Evaluation of the cerebral venous system with MRV and or with formal cerebral venography should be included in routine investigations of patients with suspected BIH.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The high pressures documented in the intracranial venous sinuses in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) could be the result of focal stenotic lesions in the lateral sinuses obstructing cranial venous outflow.

   OBJECTIVE: To explore the relation between venous sinus disease and IIH.

   METHODS: 12 patients with refractory IIH had dilatation and stenting of the venous sinuses after venography and manometry had shown intracranial venous hypertension proximal to stenoses in the lateral sinuses. Intrasinus pressures were recorded before and after the procedure and correlated with clinical outcome.

   RESULTS: Intrasinus pressures were variably reduced by stenting. Five patients were rendered asymptomatic, two were improved, and five were unchanged.

   CONCLUSIONS: The importance of venous sinus disease in the aetiology of IIH is probably underestimated. Lateral sinus stenting shows promise as an alternative treatment to neurosurgical intervention in intractable cases. [References: 21]

Abstract
  We report what we believe to be the first case of restenosis of the sigmoid sinus after stenting, in a 42-year-old man with an arteriovenous malformation with progressive right hemiparesis secondary to venous hypertension. Angiography revealed severe stenosis of the left sigmoid sinus, which was dilated with a self-expandable stent. Six months after the procedure, however, the sinus was again severely stenosed. Intravascular sonography revealed intimal proliferation in the stented sinus. It was dilated percutaneously, and the venous pressure decreased from 51 to 33 mmHg. On sonography, the intimal tissue decreased in thickness and the diameter of the stent enlarged a little.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To examine whether hypovolemia is an important cause of the acidosis in children with severe malaria.

   DESIGN: Prospective phase 1 study examining the safety of volume expansion using detailed hemodynamic monitoring.

   SETTING: High-dependency unit of Kilifi District Hospital on the coast of Kenya.

   PATIENTS: Kenyan children admitted with clinical features of severe malaria (impaired consciousness or deep breathing) complicated by acidosis (base excess of less than -8). Three groups were considered: severe malarial anemia plus acidosis if hemoglobin of <5 mg/dL and base excess less than -8; moderate malaria acidosis if the base excess was between -8 and -15; severe malaria acidosis if the base excess was less than -15.

   INTERVENTIONS: Patients received between 10 and 40 mL/kg of either 0.9% normal saline or 4.5% human albumin solution.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 53 children were recruited, and all had evidence of compensated shock at admission, with tachycardia, tachypnea, and prolonged capillary refill time. Mean central venous pressure (se) at admission was 2.9 cm H(2)O (0.5 cm H(2)O); in the severe malaria acidosis group, 44% had hypotension (systolic blood pressure of <80 mm Hg). Improvements of hemodynamic indices and a reduction in acidosis followed administration of either saline or albumin. By 8 hrs, mean central venous pressure had increased to 7.5 cm H(2)O (0.5 cm H(2)O, F = 34.4, p <.001) and was associated with a reduction in mean respiratory rate from 49 to 41 breaths/min (2 to 1 breaths/min, respectively; F = 7.0; p =.009), a reduction in tachycardia from 151 to 141 beats/min (5 to 3 beats/min, respectively; F = 3.4; p =.06), and a reduction in capillary refill time. No child developed evidence of the life threatening complications of pulmonary edema and increased intracranial pressure.

   CONCLUSIONS: Volume depletion is present at admission in the majority of children with severe malaria complicated by acidosis. Volume expansion corrects the hemodynamic abnormalities and is associated with improved organ function and reduction in acidosis. Formal trials of volume expansion are needed to determine whether volume expansion will reduce mortality.

Abstract
  The coupling of capillary electrophoresis (CE) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has demonstrated multiple advantages, including high separation efficiency, sensitivity and resolution, as well as low sample consumption and detection limit. The technique has been widely used for the speciation of environmental and biological samples. The interface between CE and the nebulizing system of ICP-MS plays a key role in the hyphenation of CE and ICP-MS. The most important factors in the interface design were reviewed in this paper, including electrical connections, nebulizer designs and flow compensation in the nebulizer system. Methods for achieving stable electrical current within the capillary were discussed, including the employment of concentric sheath flow, stainless steel components, platinum wire and silver paint. The structures and performance of various nebulizer designs were reviewed and compared, including the concentric pneumatic nebulizer (CPN), micro concentric nebulizer (MCN), high efficiency nebulizer (HEN), ultrasonic nebulizer (USN) and direct injection nebulizer (DIN). To eliminate nebulizer suction, four compensations systems were suggested, including applying a negative pressure at the inlet of the capillary, putting a sol-gel frit at the outlet of the capillary, pumping an appropriate make-up flow to the interface and adjusting the height of the make-up flow. 35 papers were cited.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: The management of patients with presumed cerebral venous thrombosis has been recently modified by magnetic resonance imaging and evidence that the early use of heparin decreases mortality and morbidity. Long term outcome of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has rarely been described. We present the results of a follow-up study.

   METHODS: Twenty patients admitted between 1987 and 1999 for CVT were retrospectively studied. Outcome and follow-up were obtained from direct observation or telephone interviews.

   RESULTS: There were 16 women and 4 men aged a mean of 39 years (range: 19 to 72). The population was followed-up for a mean of 34 months (range: 12-96). All the patients were initially treated with full-dose heparin. Thirteen of the 20 patients (65%) exhibited no after effects. Seven patients (35%) remained neurologically impaired. The outcome of clinical forms with intracranial hypertension appeared better, but the existence of an initial neurological deficit is of poor prognosis. The small cohort in our series did not permit us to identify other poor prognostic factors. One patient (5%) exhibited subsequent epilepsy. Only one patient (5%) suffered for a second CVT. One patient died from an ovarian neoplasm. No systemic venous thromboembolic relapse was reported. Three patients had non complicated pregnancies.

   CONCLUSION: Recurrent CVT and systemic venous thrombo-embolic episodes are rare although heparin treatment was suspended early in more than half of the patients. This would question the indication of long-term antivitamin K, which is clearly indicated in auto-immune diseases but is debatable in cases of thrombophilia.

Abstract
  Premature very-low-birth-weight infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus are often managed with intermittent cerebrospinal fluid drainage from a ventricular reservoir. There are little data regarding intracranial pressure changes during intermittent drainage to determine the amount and frequency of cerebrospinal fluid removal or to determine the correct resistance of future programmable shunts. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using a commercially available intracranial pressure transducer to measure changes in pressure associated with this procedure. Continuous intracranial pressure was measured in three infants with a transducer placed at the time of ventricular reservoir insertion. Daily reservoir taps began 48 hours after placement and intracranial pressure was monitored for 7 days. Intracranial pressure before the initial tap was comparable to levels previously reported as normal. The daily removal of 10 cc/kg of cerebrospinal fluid was sufficient to lower intracranial pressure below baseline, however it was associated with wide swings in pressure and, in one patient, sustained negative pressure. The use of direct intracranial pressure monitoring may be useful in determining the optimal amount and frequency of cerebrospinal drainage from infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus managed with a ventricular reservoir, as well as determining resistance settings of subsequent programmable shunts.

Abstract
  OBJECT: Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is a condition of raised intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion or cerebral edema. It is characterized by headache and visual deterioration that may culminate in blindness. Pseudotumor cerebri is caused by venous sinus obstruction in an unknown percentage of cases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of cerebral venous sinus disease in pseudotumor cerebri and the potential of endoluminal venous sinus stent placement as a new treatment.

   METHODS: Nine consecutive patients in whom diagnoses of pseudotumor cerebri had been made underwent examination with direct retrograde cerebral venography (DRCV) and manometry to characterize the morphological features and venous pressures in their cerebral venous sinuses. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was measured simultaneously in two patients. If patients had an amenable lesion they were treated using an endoluminal venous sinus stent. Five patients demonstrated morphological obstruction of the venous transverse sinuses (TSs). All lesions were associated with a distinct pressure gradient and raised proximal venous sinus pressures. Four patients underwent stent insertion in the venous sinuses and reported that their headaches improved immediately after the procedure and remained so at 6 months. Vision was improved in three patients, whereas it remained poor in one despite normalized CSF pressures.

   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pseudotumor cerebri should be evaluated with DRCV and manometry because venous TS obstruction is probably more common than is currently appreciated. In patients with a lesion of the venous sinuses, treatment with an endoluminal venous sinus stent is a viable alternative for amenable lesions.

Abstract
  The focus was placed on the physiological mechanisms of correction of the blood redistribution during the head-down tilt (HDT) with a discrete or complex use of the methods of negative pressure respiration (NPR) and lower body negative pressure (LBNP). It was evidenced that rise in the intracranial hydrostatic pressure in HDT (-6 degrees) can be compensated by NPR within a range of -10 to -15 cm of water column causing decrease in the intrasternal pressure from -5.04 to -7.74 cm w.c. Bioimpedance and ultrasonic investigations led to the conclusion that the decreased transpulmonary pressure is responsible for blood outflow from the intracranial venous system till the level adequate to the horizontal position of the body. The results were verified in experiments with unconscious cats: pressure in the exterior jugular vein and v. cava superior during HDT (-30 degrees) with NRP at -5 cm w.c. decreased by 3.2. and 4.3. w.c., respectively. Experiments with human subjects also demonstrated that the complex use of NPR and LBNP produces an additive hemodynamic effect and can be considered a new method for correcting the adverse consequences of redistribution of the local blood volumes toward the head end.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is a high-energy intermediate in the anaerobic metabolism. It enhances glycolysis, preserves cellular adenosine triphosphate, and prevents the increase of intracellular calcium during ischemia. The potential neuroprotective effect of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate during hypothermic circulatory arrest was evaluated in a surviving porcine model.

   METHODS: Twenty-four pigs were randomly assigned to receive two intravenous infusions of either fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (500 mg/kg) or saline solution. The first infusion was given immediately before a 75-minute period of hypothermic circulatory arrest and the second was given immediately after hypothermic circulatory arrest.

   RESULTS: The 7-day survivals were 83.3% in the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate group and 41.7% in the control group (P =.09). The treated animals had significantly better postoperative behavioral scores. The administration of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate was associated with higher venous phosphate and sodium levels, lower venous ionized calcium levels, higher blood osmolarity, and a better fluid balance. Intracranial pressure and venous creatine kinase isoenzyme MB were significantly lower in the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate group during rewarming (P =.01 and P =.001, respectively). Among the treated animals, brain glucose, pyruvate and lactate levels tended to be higher, brain glycerol levels tended to be lower, and the histopathologic score of the brain was significantly lower (P =.04).

   CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous administration of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate at 500 mg/kg before and after hypothermic circulatory arrest in a surviving porcine model was associated with better survival, behavioral outcome, and histopathologic score. The observed lower blood creatine kinase isoenzyme MB and brain glycerol levels and the higher brain glucose, pyruvate, and lactate levels in the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate group suggest that this drug has supportive effects on myocardial and brain metabolisms.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To describe a real-time, continuous physiologic data acquisition system for the study of disease dynamics in the intensive care unit.

   DESIGN: Descriptive report.

   SETTING: A 16-bed pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care children's hospital.

   PATIENTS: A total of 170 critically ill or injured pediatric patients.

   INTERVENTIONS: None.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: None.

   RESULTS: We describe a computerized data acquisition and analysis system for the study of critical illness and injury from the perspective of complex dynamic systems. Both parametric (1 Hz) and waveform (125-500 Hz) signals are recorded and analyzed. Waveform data include electrocardiogram, respiration, systemic arterial pressure (invasive and noninvasive), central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, left and right atrial pressures, intracranial pressure, body temperature, and oxygen saturation. Details of the system components are explained and examples are given from the resultant physiologic database of signal processing algorithms and signal analyses using linear and nonlinear metrics.

   CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully developed a real-time, continuous physiologic data acquisition system that can capture, store, and archive data from pediatric intensive care unit patients for subsequent time series analysis of dynamic changes in physiologic state. The physiologic signal database generated from this system is available for analysis of dynamic changes caused by critical illness and injury.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of hypothermia on intracranial pressure, systemic and intracranial hemodynamics, and metabolism in patients with severe traumatic brain injury to clarify the optimal temperature for hypothermia, with a view toward establishing the proper management techniques for such patients.

   METHODS: The study was performed in 31 patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score as high as 5). All patients were sedated, paralyzed, ventilated, and cooled to 33 degrees C. Brain temperature, core temperature, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, jugular venous oxygen saturation, mixed venous oxygen saturation, cardiac output, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and resting energy expenditure were monitored continuously.

   RESULTS: Intracranial pressure decreased significantly at brain temperatures below 37 degrees C and decreased more sharply at temperatures 35 to 36 degrees C, but no differences were observed at temperatures below 35 degrees C. Cerebral perfusion pressure peaked at 35.0 to 35.9 degrees C and decreased with further decreases in temperature. Jugular venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen saturation remained in the normal range during hypothermia. Resting energy expenditure and cardiac output decreased progressively with hypothermia. Oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption decreased to abnormally low levels at rectal temperatures below 35 degrees C, and the correlation between them became less significant at less than 35 degrees C than that when temperatures were 35 degrees C or higher. Brain temperature was consistently higher than rectal temperature by 0.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C.

   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, after traumatic brain injury, decreasing body temperature to 35 to 35.5 degrees C can reduce intracranial hypertension while maintaining sufficient cerebral perfusion pressure without cardiac dysfunction or oxygen debt. Thus, 35 to 35.5 degrees C seems to be the optimal temperature at which to treat patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Appropriate preclinical evaluation of a bioartificial liver assist device (BAL) demands a large animal model, as presented here, that demonstrates many of the clinical features of acute liver failure and that is suitable for clinical qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the BAL. A lethal canine liver failure model of acute hepatic failure that removes many of the artifacts evidenced in prior canine models is presented.

   METHODS: Six male hounds, 24-30 kg, under isoflurane anesthesia, were administered 1.5 g/kg D-galactosamine intravenously. Canine supportive care followed a well-defined management protocol that was guided by electrolyte and invasive monitoring consisting of arterial pressure, central venous pressure, extradural intracranial pressure (ICP), pulmonary artery pressure, and end-tidal CO2. The animals were treated until death-equivalent, defined as inability to sustain systolic blood pressure >80 mmHg for 20 minutes despite maximal fluids and 20 microg/kg/min dopamine infusion.

   RESULTS: The mean survival time was 43.7+/-4.6 hours (mean+/-SE). All animals showed evidence of progressive liver failure characterized by increasing liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase from 26 to 5977 IU/L; alanine transaminase from 32 to 9740 IU/L), bilirubin (0.25 to 1.30 mg/dl), ammonia (19.8 to 85.3 micromol/L), and coagulopathy (prothrombin time from 8.7 to 46 s). Increased lability and elevations in intracranial pressures were observed. All animals were refractory to maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure even with only moderately elevated intracranial pressure. Severe neurologic obtundation, seen in 2 of 6 animals, was associated with elevations of ICP above 50 mmHg. Post-mortem liver histology showed evidence of massive hepatic necrosis. Postmortem blood and ascites microbial growth was consistent with possible translocation of intestinal microbes.

   CONCLUSIONS: The improved lethal canine liver failure model presented here reproduces many of the clinical features of acute liver failure. The model may prove useful for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of BALs.

Abstract
  Low pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is a rare clinical condition. We report our experience with 10 patients treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. We reviewed the records of 10 patients (five men, five women; mean age 43 years) treated between 1996 and 2000. All underwent intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and subatmospheric cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage with an intraventricular or lumbar catheter. All patients developed ventriculomegaly: five following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage; one after meningitis; one after intraventricular haemorrhage. Three patients presented with chronic aqueductal stenosis. Ventriculomegaly was clinically detected on average 12 days after presentation. Mean ICP was 4.8 mmHg (range 0-10). All patients improved only in the setting of negative pressure CSF drainage, and were subsequently treated with low pressure ventriculo- or lumboperitoneal shunts. At 1 year, eight patients (80%) showed good recovery to minimal disability; seven patients (70%) had resolving ventriculomegaly. The mechanism of low pressure hydrocephalus remains unclear. In our cohort, different aetiologies were responsible for the change in compliance/elastance of the brain parenchyma and subsequent development of ventriculomegaly. We propose that while ventriculomegaly (and therefore neuronal dysfunction) can be initiated in the setting of high ICP, the maintenance of ventriculomegaly at normal or low ICP is a physiological example of hysteresis. This behaviour, which has been characterized by the chaos theory of non-linear dynamics as a Hopf bifurcation, explains how a system can exhibit two different states (ventricular size) at a single parameter value (ICP). Most importantly, it helps to explain how lowering ICP in the setting of LPH can resolve ventriculomegaly and its neurologic sequelae.

Abstract
  Cerebral vein and dural sinus thromboses (CVT) appear to be rare, but their identification has increased in recent year, due to the increased use of MRI and to a better knowledge of the variable clinical presentation of CVT.CVT can be diagnosed by MR and MR-angiography. Catheter angiography is reserved for cases whose diagnosis remains uncertain with MR. The individual risk for CVT is determined by genetic factors, but may be increased by numerous predisposing conditions and precipitating factors. In recent CVT series death rate is below 10% and about 80% of patients make a complete recovery. The treatment of CVT includes etiological and symptomatic treatment, antithrombotic therapy (anticoagulants, local thrombolysis) and the treatment of intracranial hypertension. There are few randomized trials upon which to base treatment recommendations. [References: 47]

Abstract
  OBJECTS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakages through the operation wound following shunt placement are commonly treated by head elevation when the shunt is patent and signs of infection are absent.

   METHODS AND RESULTS: In two cases in which the standard therapy of head elevation failed, the leakage was successfully managed by temporary lowering of the opening pressure of the implanted programmable valve. Case 1 was that of a preterm baby with repaired meningomyelocele and shunted hydrocephalus. A shunt infection made shunt removal necessary. Five days after insertion of a new ventriculoperitoneal shunt, transcutaneous CSF flow occurred. The CSF leak was cured by a temporary reduction of the opening pressure from 70 to 30 mm H(2)0. Case 2 was in a 9-month-old child with shunted posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Shunt infection was treated by shunt removal, placement of external ventricular drainage, and antibiotics. CSF leakage through the operation wound developed 24 h after placement of the new ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The CSF leakage was successfully treated by temporarily lowering the opening pressure of the valve from 100 to 50 mm H(2)0.

   CONCLUSION: The authors assume that head elevation alone did not generate a sufficient difference between the ventricular and the abdominal pressure for the selected opening pressure of the valve to be exceeded, with the result that CSF flowed around the ventricular catheter and through the operation wound. It is believed that reduction of the opening pressure of the valve led to CSF flow through the shunt and made siphoning possible, resulting in cessation of the transcutaneous CSF flow. The authors propose the prophylactic implantation of a programmable valve in children at high risk of postoperative transcutaneous CSF leakage.

Abstract
  Cerebrovascular anomalies remain an issue of controversy regarding diagnosis, classification, and treatment. We report the first case of total and asymptomatic regression and disappearance of a vein of Galen malformation associated with a posterior fossa venous pouch. Different aspects of the vein of Galen are discussed together with emphasis on the underlying mechanisms of spontaneous thrombosis and regression.A 4-month-old boy presented with macrocrania and signs of intracranial hypertension. Computerized tomography disclosed two masses, the first was a giant aneurysmal dilatation in the posterior fossa, and the second was a gigantic pouch at the level of the vein of Galen. Hydrocephalus was treated by ventriculo-peritoneal shunting. Two months later, the shunt was revised, and posterior fossa was explored without active treatment. Both abnormalities regressed spontaneously. No recurrence occurred, and the child remained neurologically intact. Total disappearance of the masses as well as normal brain and cerebrovascular anatomy were confirmed by angiography, MRI, and MRA. Over a follow-up period of 17 years, the patient did not develop complications. He had perfect clinical tolerance and resumed a normal life.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure or elevated intracranial pressure are at risk of developing lung oedema when anaesthesized. Lung oedema may develop in patients with airway obstructions as well.

   MATERIAL AND RESULTS: We refer to a four-year-old boy anaesthesized for elective adenotomia and paracentesis. After being extubated, he developed a moderate inspiratory stridor lasting for hours. Clinically he normalized in two hours on a therapy with oxygen in a mask with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and finally bronchodilator therapy with epinephrine and salbutamol. Successive lung X-rays showed lung oedema almost normalizing in 48 hours.

   INTERPRETATION: The triggering mechanism of lung oedema in airway obstruction is the negative intrathoracal pressure generated because of forced inspiratory effort. This pressure is transformed to a negative interstitial hydrostatic pressure that according to Starling's hypothesis on capillary filtration may generate a lung oedema. We conclude that our patient with nasal polyps had a lowered threshold for developing lung oedema faced with postextubatory complications causing inspiratory stridor. Pathogenic mechanisms are discussed.

Abstract
  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage has recently been documented in most patients, as the main cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). No cases of SIH accompanying an episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has yet been reported and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient, who developed SAH during his clinical course of SIH. SAH was cured completely by surgical intervention. A 57-year-old man, with a history of a sustained postural headache, suffered the sudden onset of severe nuchal pain. SAH in the basal cistern, together with the finding of bilateral subdural fluid retention were verified by CT. Angiogram showed no vascular abnormalities of cerebral or cervical vessels. Gd-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) disclosed diffuse meningeal enhancement. RI cisternogram and CT-myelogram (CTM) suggested that the region of CSF leakage should be in the retrospinal area at the level of C1-2. Because orthostatic headache failed to resolve even with 3 weeks of bed rest, surgical intervention was successfully carried out to seal the site of CSF leakage with the use of a fascia and fibrin glue. We have speculated that the etiology of SAH might have been a secondary rupture of congestive intracranial veins, such as basilar plexus or bridging veins, induced by a decrease of intracranial CSF pressure.

Abstract
  135 patients from 16 to 59 years old with benign intracranial hypertension syndrome (BIH) due to postinflammatory processes (A), venous outflow disorders (V), and endocrinological disorders (G) were investigated by CT, MRI, MRI-Ag, carotid-Ag and constant pressure infusion test. All the obtained data were analyzed and possible relationships between the parameters of CSF dynamics and the clinical data were evaluated. Correlative analysis of the obtained data was performed and the main mechanisms of compensation of BIH syndrome were established. In patients of group A disturbances of CSF absorption system with high level of CSF outflow resistance (R) and secondary elevation of brain elastance (EL) were common. In patients of this group venous disorders were of secondary nature and appeared in a later period of the disease. The patients of group V showed increased intrasinus pressure, which correlated to high R and EL. In patients of group G we found the signs of CSF hyper-production with high level of EL. Increased R in patients of this group seemed to be a secondary reaction. The investigation identified the main stages of evolution and compensation of hypertension in the patients with BIH syndrome. The obtained data may be used in optimizing the conservative therapy and indications for lumboperitoneal shunting.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: Early ischemia may be highly relevant in patients with severe head injuries. The aims of the study were: 1) to define if abnormal arteriovenous lactate difference (AVDL) and jugular bulb oxygen saturation (SjO2) are found in the early 24 hrs post injury; 2) to compare if abnormalities of SjO2 and of AVDL were associated with a specific typology of severity indexes and outcome; 3) to detect any association between abnormal AVDL and SjO2 with levels of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The study involved 29 patients, with CPP, AVDL and SjO2 measured within 24 hours post-injury.

   RESULTS: 1) Abnormal AVDL was found in 21% while abnormal SjO2 was detected in 38% of the patients; 2) abnormal AVDL was associated with cases of most severe injury; 3) CPP level below 60 mmHg was associated with abnormal AVDL and SjO2. Low CPP appeared to be the most likely measurable cause of early ischemia. Abnormalities of AVDL appeared to be more sensitive, than SjO2, with regard to detection of the most severe cases.

Abstract
  Presenting symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are known to vary with age. Older children may complain of headache, neck pain, diplopia, intracranial noises, or transient visual obscurations. Younger children may present with apathy or irritability. This report describes three young children with no obvious relevant symptoms in whom papilledema was newly found on routine follow-up eye examination for unrelated problems. At presentation, all had early papilledema with negative cranial neuroimaging studies. All remained apparently asymptomatic, but the papilledema progressed. Sedated lumbar puncture showed elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure in all three. Two were felt to have truly idiopathic intracranial hypertension, whereas the third had jugular venous obstruction. The papilledema responded to treatment with either acetazolamide or furosemide in all three. An apparent lack of symptoms does not rule out chronic increased intracranial pressure in young children.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenesis, clinical features, radiographic findings and therapeutic outcomes of non-acute intracranial deep venous thrombosis in adults.

   METHODS: Five patients who presented with increased intracranial pressure were examined with computed tomography, magnetic resonance and angiography, diagnosed as having non-acute intracranial deep venous thrombosis, and treated with thrombolytic therapy. They were reviewed retrospectively.

   RESULTS: There were 3 men and 2 women, aged from 22 to 49 years. Symptom duration ranged from 1 month to 7 months, and 4 of the 5 patients were associated with venous sinus thrombosis. Two patients developed cold and fever before the onset of disease, and 3 patients had no evident predisposing factors. After the infusion of thrombolytic and systemic anti-coagulant therapy, the neurological symptoms and signs of the patients were alleviated.

   CONCLUSIONS: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is more sensitive and accurate than MRI on diagnosing intracranial deep venous thrombosis. It may play an important role in the assessment of the treatment of intracranial deep venous thrombosis. Thrombolysis and anticoagulation of intracranial deep venous thrombosis appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment not only in the acute stage but also in the non-acute stage.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Increased abdominal pressure is associated with elevations in the intracranial pressure (ICP) and impaired renal function. These adverse effects are potentially important in clinical situations such as severe abdominal trauma and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. It was hypothesized that the secondary elevation of ICP leads to release of vasoconstrictors, which may affect renal function by decreasing the renal blood flow (RBF). We investigated the effect of laparoscopy on ICP and renal blood flow in a porcine model.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The abdominal pressure of swine (N = 5; 20-25 kg) was gradually increased from baseline to 5, 15, and 25 mm Hg by insufflation of nitrogen into the abdominal cavity. The ICP was measured using a Camino monitor, and RBF was simultaneously measured using a Transonic Doppler probe placed on the renal artery. Results were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and the paired t-test.

   RESULTS: No significant change from baseline was observed in ICP and RBF when the abdominal pressure was 5 mm Hg. However, both ICP and RBF were affected by increasing the abdominal pressure to 15 and 25 mm Hg (P = 0.035 and 0.04 for ICP and P = 0.074 and 0.034 for RBF, respectively).

   CONCLUSIONS: Low-pressure laparoscopy may reduce the adverse effects of pneumoperitoneum on ICP and RBF. It may be advisable to use low pressures in laparoscopic surgery, especially when changes in ICP or renal perfusion may have significant clinical implications.

  Decompressive craniectomy with durotomy, is possible as a last resort therapy for severe traumatic brain swelling. Although the method successfully diminishes the ICP, partial or total vascular insufficiency occurs in the herniated part of the brain. The actual cause of the insufficiency is most likely due to the compression of the cortical veins and arteries supplying the herniated brain, caused by shearing and pressure forces between the dural edge and brain tissue. Furthermore venous congestion may induce edema in the protruding parts of the brain, thus further compromising neurone viability. The new surgical technique consists of a stellate type durotomy and the creation of a vascular tunnel around the main cortical veins and arteries, with the aim that the vessels do not become compressed by the dural or bone edge. The effect of the novel vascular tunnel technique was proven by measuring the blood flow of the protected and nonprotected veins with Doppler UH, intra-operatively. In the last two years 28 patients were operated on with this method. One case of edema was caused by SAH. All were in severe GCS 3 or GCS 4 status, with more than 30 mmHg ICP. In comparison with the traditional surgical and nonsurgical treatment, where the reported mortality rates are 80%-90% in these severe cases the mortality rate was reduced to 40%, and recovery (GOS 4, 5) rate also increased significantly. With this technique the ICP was significantly reduced and further edema and vascular insufficiency was prevented. This was due to protection of the arterial circulation and venous drainage of the herniated part of the brain, by the formation of a vascular tunnel at the durotomy edges.

Abstract
  In patients with head injury, endotracheal suctioning (ETS) is a potentially dangerous procedure, because it can increase intracranial pressure (ICP). The purpose of this prospective nonrandomized study was to evaluate the impact of ETS on intracranial dynamics in the acute phase of head injury. Seventeen patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Score < or = 8, range 4-8), sedated and mechanically ventilated, were studied during the first week after trauma. Single-pass ETS maneuver (with a 16-French catheter, negative pressure of 100 mm Hg, and duration of less than 30 seconds) was performed 60 seconds after the FiO2 was increased to 100%. After ETS, FiO2 was maintained at 100% for another 30 seconds. Before and after ETS, arterial blood gases and jugular oxygen saturation (S(j)O2), ICP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated. A total of 131 ETS episodes, which consisted of repeated assessment of each patient, were analyzed. Six patients in 20 cases coughed and/or moved during ETS because of inadequate sedation. After ETS, ICP increased from 20 +/- 12 to 22 +/- 13 mm Hg in well-sedated patients and from 15 +/- 9 to 28 +/- 9 mm Hg in patients who coughed and/or moved (mean change, 2 +/- 6 versus 13 +/- 6 mm Hg, P <.0001). CPP and S(j)O2 increased in well-sedated patients (from 78 +/- 16 to 83 +/- 19 mm Hg, and from 71 +/- 10 to 73 +/- 13%, respectively) and decreased in patients who reacted to ETS (from 79 +/- 14 to 72 +/- 14 mm Hg and from 69 +/- 7 to 66 +/- 9%, respectively), and the differences were significant (mean change, CPP: 5 +/- 14 versus -7 +/- 15 mm Hg, P =.003; (S(j)O2) 2 +/- 5 vs. -3 +/- 5%, P <.0001). In well-sedated patients, endotracheal suctioning caused an increase in ICP, CPP, and S j O 2 without evidence of ischemia. In contrast, in patients who coughed or moved in response to suctioning, there was a slight and significant decrease in CPP and S(j)O2. In the case of patients with head injuries who coughed or moved during endotracheal suctioning, we strongly suggest deepening the level of sedation before completing the procedure to reduce the risk of adverse effects.

Abstract
  OBJECT: A pilot study was performed to assess noninvasively the change in intracranial compliance (ICC) and intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with Chiari I malformation who undergo foramen magnum decompression. The working hypothesis was that the main effect of the decompressive surgery is a change in ICP. Noninvasive cine phasecontrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a motion-sensitive dynamic MR imaging technique that allows for visualization and quantitation of tissue motion and flow. The authors' group has used dynamic phase-contrast MR imaging to visualize and quantify pulsatile blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in the craniospinal system.

   METHODS: A system approach has been used to characterize the hemodynamic-hydrodynamic coupling in the craniospinal system and to derive measures for ICC and ICP. Magnetic resonance imaging-based ICC and ICP values are derived from the ratio of the volume and pressure changes that occur naturally during each cardiac cycle. The authors conducted a prospective study of four patients, three of whom were studied before and after decompressive surgery; significant change in MR imaging-derived ICC and ICP values was documented in only one of the three surgically treated patients. A significant change in the dynamics of the intracranial volume change (ICVC) during the cardiac cycle, however, was observed in all three patients. In healthy individuals the ICVC waveform usually consists of the following sequence: monotonic increase in intracranial volume (ICV) during the systolic phase due to increased blood inflow, monotonic decrease in ICV caused by the onset of CSF outflow into the spinal canal, and increase in the venous outflow. A nonmonotonic decline in the ICVC waveform has been observed in all patients with headaches, and a relatively normal waveform was found in those without headaches or whose headaches were resolved or alleviated by the surgery. A "partial-valve" mechanism is proposed as an explanation for the abnormal ICVC dynamics. The monotonic decline in ICVC is interrupted by a "premature" reduction in the CSF outflow. This may be caused by a displacement of the hindbrain into the cervical spinal canal during the systolic phase. This obstructs the CSF flow at the later part of the systolic phase such that the ICV does not continue its gradual decline. Postsurgery, the ICVC waveforms presented a more normal-appearing ICVC dynamics profile.

   CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging measurement of transcranial CSF and blood flow may lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of Chiari malformations and may prove to be an important diagnostic tool for guiding for the treatment of patients with Chiari I malformation.

Abstract
  The author outlines the history of the development of the pseudotumor concept, first specifically formulated by Nonne in 1904 but implicit in earlier descriptions. A scheme of periodization is applied, identifying otological, neurosurgical, neurological, and neuroophthalmological periods; he relates theoretical and practical developments in the understanding of the condition to the concerns of the dominant speciality involved in diagnosis and management. Key studies from each period are discussed in relation to the issues of mechanism, origin, nomenclature, diagnosis, and treatment. During the otological period, approaches to the condition were heavily influenced by its common association with middle ear infection, often with venous sinus involvement, and this led to the idea of disturbed cerebrospinal fluid dynamics as the cause. The advent of neuroradiological systems ushered in the neurosurgical period in which the significant but unfinished debate began: which intracranial compartment is primarily implicated in the intracranial hypertension? By the time of the neurological period cerebral edema was implicated as the cause, and this coincided with the availability of appropriate treatment methods and steroidal and diuretic agents. Toward the end of this period additional major advances in investigative methods again brought the issue of mechanism into contention, although a resolution was not to follow. The neuroophthalmological period is characterized by an increased awareness of the significance of visual loss and a return to one of the original methods of treatment. Finally, the possible significance of impaired cranial venous outflow, a thread running through all periods, is considered.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Elevated intraabdominal pressure (IAP) is observed in various clinical situations, the most common of which are severe abdominal trauma and laparoscopic surgery. Extreme pressures may lead to Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS), but even with lower pressures adverse effects are apparent. The cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the kidneys and the visceral circulation are all affected, but the exact physiological mechanism is not well defined.

   AIMS: To discuss possible mechanisms which explain the observed hemodynamic effects of increased IAP.

   METHODS: Large animal model observations and review of current literature regarding the correlation between IAP and intracranial pressure (ICP).

   RESULTS: It was shown that the elevation of abdominal pressure leads to elevation of ICP. Transfer of pressure through the central venous system or by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been proposed as an explanation. In response to elevated ICP, various stress hormones are secreted by the central nervous system, including vasoconstricting agents such as vasopressin and catecholamines. It is hypothesized that the central nervous system is the link between the increased abdominal pressure and its adverse hemodynamic effects. This may be a protective mechanism of the brain, aimed to increase the mean arterial pressure when the ICP is elevated, in order to preserve the cerebral perfusion pressure.

   CONCLUSION: ICP is elevated in response to IAP elevation, and may be responsible for its adverse hemodynamic effects. Antagonists to vasopressin may have a role in the treatment of this condition. [References: 97]

Abstract
  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can diagnose early stage not only of the arterial infarction but also of venous infarction. We successfully diagnosed a case as acute venous infarction by DWI. The patient, an infant of one year and ten months, presented disturbance of consciousness and left hemiparesis two weeks after dehydration and infections. Computed tomographic scan revealed a cerebral hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe. Cerebral angiography revealed no contrast filling of the posterior side of superior sagittal sinus, straight sinus and transverse sinus. DWI demonstrated a large hyperintensity lesion around the hematoma, suggesting venous infarction in the early stage. We thought that venous infarction was caused by secondary extension of thrombus to cerebral cortical veins and deep cerebral veins. External decompression and postoperative hypothermia therapy were performed because of rapidly deteriorating intracranial hypertension. Intracranial hypertension was, however, uncontrollable. The patient died four days after the onset. Diagnosis of the venous infarction by DWI was discussed along with other recent reports. Diffusion hyperintensity was displayed in almost all subjects with acute venous infarction. DWI pattern of venous infarction is more heterogeneous than that of arterial one because pathway from venous obstruction to infarction is complicated. [References: 11]

Abstract
  OBJECT: The poor prognosis for traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) might be due to underlying primary brain damage, ischemia, or both. Ischemia in ASDH is likely caused by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), but the degree to which these phenomena occur is unknown. The authors report data obtained before and during removal of ASDH in five cases.

   METHODS: Five patients who underwent emergency evacuation of ASDH were monitored. In all patients, without delaying treatment, a separate surgical team (including the senior author) placed an ICP monitor and a jugular bulb catheter, and in two patients a laser Doppler probe was placed. The ICP prior to removing the bone flap in the five patients was 85, 85, 50, 59, and greater than 40 mm Hg, resulting in CPPs of 25, 3, 25, 56, and less than 50 mm Hg, respectively. Removing the bone flap as well as opening the dura and removing the blood clot produced a significant decrease in ICP and an increase in CPP. Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) increased in four patients and decreased in the other during removal of the hematoma. Laser Doppler flow also increased, to 217% and 211% compared with preevacuation flow.

   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial pressure is higher than previously suspected and CPP is very low in patients with ASDH. Removal of the bone flap yielded a significant reduction in ICP, which was further decreased by opening the dura and evacuating the hematoma. The SjvO2 as well as laser Doppler flow increased in all patients but one immediately after removal of the hematoma.

Abstract
  Headaches that have an explosive onset with exercise, including sexual activity, generally are benign in origin. A subarachnoid hemorrhage, a mass lesion in the brain, or an anomaly of the posterior fossa must be considered, however. The mechanisms that produce sexually induced or cough headaches of abrupt onset are unknown. It is known, however, that a rapid increase in intrathoracic pressure suddenly reduces right atrial pressure and presumably decreases venous sinus drainage from the brain. This situation results in a transient increase in intracranial pressure. Jaw pain that occurs with chewing often is considered to be TMJ dysfunction when arthritic in quality and if subluxations of the jaw can be shown on the physical examination. Giant cell arteritis and common or external carotid artery occlusive disease should be considered when the pain is ischemic in quality. An anginal equivalent is another possibility. Headaches that worsen with vigorous exercise are commonly migrainous. When their onset is apoplectic with exertion (particularly exertion against a closed glottis), the most likely diagnoses are increased intracranial pressure, a posterior fossa abnormality, or benign exertional headaches. Most cardiac induced headaches, but not all, are of a more gradual onset. If there are significant risk factors for coronary artery disease, an exercise stress test is appropriate. A therapeutic trial of nitroglycerin may help to establish a diagnosis if it improves the headache. Using antimigraine drugs as a diagnostic test is inappropriate because triptans and ergots are contraindicated in the presence of coronary artery disease, and a positive response is not diagnostic of migraine.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a stepwise increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on intracranial pressure (ICP) and to further define the pressure transmission characteristics of different body compartments.

   DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized study.

   SETTING: A multidisciplinary intensive care unit at a university medical center.

   PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with moderate-to-severe head injury.

   INTERVENTIONS: All patients were studied after the initial stabilization and resolution of intracranial hypertension. Measurements were carried out before and 20 mins after IAP was increased by positioning a soft, 15-L water bag on the patient's abdomen.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Placing weights upon the abdomen generated a significant increase in IAP, which rose from 4.7 +/- 2.9 to 15.5 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (p <.001). The rise in IAP caused concomitant and rapid increases in central venous pressure (from 6.2 +/- 2.4 to 10.4 +/- 2.9 mm Hg; p <.001), internal jugular pressure (from 11.9 +/- 3.2 to 14.3 +/- 2.4 mm Hg; p <.001), and ICP (from 12.0 +/- 4.2 to 15.5 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; p <.001). Thoracic transmural pressure, calculated as the difference between central venous pressure and esophageal pressure, remained constant during the protocol. Respiratory system compliance decreased from 58.9 +/- 9.8 to 44.9 +/- 9.4 mL/cm H2O (p <.001) in all patients because of decreased chest wall compliance. The mean arterial pressure increased from 94 +/- 11 to 100 +/- 13 mm Hg (p <.01), which allowed the maintenance of a stable cerebral perfusion pressure (82.4 +/- 10.3 vs. 84.7 +/- 11.5 mm Hg; p = NS) despite the ICP increase.

   CONCLUSIONS: Increased IAP causes a significant rise in ICP in head trauma patients. This effect seems to be the result of an increase in intrathoracic pressure, which causes a functional obstruction to cerebral venous outflow. Routine assessment of IAP may help clinicians to identify remediable causes of increased ICP. Caution should be used when applying laparoscopic techniques in neurotrauma patients.

Abstract
  Previous studies have shown that laparoscopic interventions are associated with increases in intracranial pressure. However, the consequences on cerebral blood flow (CBF) are unknown. This study investigates the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneum on CBF in pigs. Ten pigs (weight, 20-26 kg) were anesthetized with 1.4% isoflurane and fentanyl (1 microg/kg per minute). Mechanical ventilation (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.4) was set to maintain normocapnia (end-tidal CO2 tension = 35 mm Hg). Arterial and central venous catheters were placed for measurement of mean arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure. Bilateral internal carotid artery blood flow was measured using two transient time flow probes placed around both carotid arteries (with ligated external carotid arteries). Cortical and subcortical cerebral blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. Sagittal sinus pressure was measured via a superior sagittal sinus catheter. After baseline measurements, the peritoneal cavity of the animals was insufflated with CO2 to achieve an intraabdominal pressure of 12-mm Hg. After 10 minutes of stable CO2, pneumoperitoneum measurements were repeated. Increases in central venous pressure (6.3 +/- 2.1 to 11.1 +/- 3.0 mm Hg) and sagittal sinus pressure (8.0 +/- 2.8 to 11.9 +/- 3.0 mm Hg) were noted during CO2 pneumoperitoneum (P < .05). Bilateral internal carotid artery blood flow (46.0 +/- 7.4 vs 47.7 +/- 7.1 mL/100g per minute), cortical CBF (263 +/- 115 vs 259 +/- 158 tissue perfusion units), and subcortical CBF (131 +/- 145 vs 133 +/- 149 tissue perfusion units) did not change during CO2 pneumoperitoneum. The current data show that CO2 pneumoperitoneum increases sagittal sinus pressure without changing CBF. Increases in sagittal sinus pressure are likely related to decreases in cerebral venous drainage caused by increases in intraabdominal pressure.

Abstract
  Abdominal compartment syndrome may be defined as the deleterious pathophysiologic consequences of a significant increase in intra-abdominal pressure. These alterations can affect respiratory mechanics, cardiovascular system, regional blood flow, renal function, urine output, and intracranial pressure. Although the syndrome may be associated with many clinical situations, the most common are severe abdominal trauma and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Diagnosis depends upon recognition of the clinical syndrome followed by an objective measurement of intra-abdominal pressure, the most common being the measurement of bladder pressure. Treatment consists of adequate fluid resuscitation and surgical decompression when necessary.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Thrombosis of the veins and venous sinuses is an uncommon condition. In 1947 it was described in adults by Garcin and Pestel. It is a potentially serious disorder, in which there is severe intracranial hypertension which may be fatal or cause serious neurological sequelae. Diagnosis is made, during life, on the clinical condition and neuro-imaging features. We consider that treatment of the underlying condition is essential to improve prognosis, although this is controversial. In Cuba there are no publications reporting series of patients with this condition.

   CLINICAL CASES: We present five patients, four of whom were women, with a neurological disorder involving focal neurological deficits, headache and severe intracranial hypertension, of subacute onset and with convulsions in 60%. The results of imaging studies were compatible with thrombosis of veins and/or venous sinuses. The diagnosis was conformed at necropsy in two patients. The commonest risk factor was the puerperium, occurring in four cases. The patients were treated symptomatically. Two patients died. The other patients made good progress.

   CONCLUSIONS: The puerperium is the commonest risk factor in thrombosis of the venous sinuses and the veins draining into them. Headache, neurological focal signs and level of consciousness are the main symptoms and signs. Coma, haemorrhagic infarct and convulsions are of bad prognosis and followed by unsatisfactory progress of the disorder.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Venous obstruction has been postulated as a cause of increased intracranial pressure, but it has been documented rarely. We present a case of obstruction of the torcula by a slow-growing epidermoid. The tumor caused increased intracranial pressure, which was relieved when it was excised. In addition, the torcular epidermoid is associated with a bifid straight sinus.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old man presented with a headache and a lump on the back of the head. Physical examination revealed a firm, bony lesion approximately 4 x 4 cm in size. Lumbar puncture demonstrated an intraspinal pressure of 39 cm H2O. Neuroradiological studies revealed an epidermoid that compressed and almost completely occluded the torcula.

   INTERVENTION: After the tumor was resected, the intraspinal pressure decreased to 19 cm H2O and remained stable 6 months later.

   CONCLUSION: Pure venous obstruction causes increased intracranial pressure. Removal of the obstruction relieves the intracranial hypertension. In addition, computed tomographic venography is a safe and easy method of documenting torcular anatomy, and it was useful in the follow-up of this patient. Computed tomographic venography can demonstrate a double straight sinus, which is a congenital variant that may be associated with the epidermoid.

Abstract
  OBJECT: Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) therapy has been shown to reduce mortality by 50% in a prospective randomized trial of severely brain injured patients conducted at the authors' institution. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of HBO on cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolism, and intracranial pressure (ICP), and to determine the optimal HBO treatment paradigm.

   METHODS: Oxygen (100% O2, 1.5 atm absolute) was delivered to 37 patients in a hyperbaric chamber for 60 minutes every 24 hours (maximum of seven treatments/patient). Cerebral blood flow, arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO2), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate, and ICP values were obtained 1 hour before and 1 hour and 6 hours after a session in an HBO chamber. Patients were assigned to one of three categories according to whether they had reduced, normal, or raised CBF before HBO. In patients in whom CBF levels were reduced before HBO sessions, both CBF and CMRO2 levels were raised 1 hour and 6 hours after HBO (p < 0.05). In patients in whom CBF levels were normal before HBO sessions, both CBF and CMRO2 levels were increased at 1 hour (p < 0.05), but were decreased by 6 hours after HBO. Cerebral blood flow was reduced 1 hour and 6 hours after HBO (p < 0.05), but CMRO2 was unchanged in patients who had exhibited a raised CBF before an HBO session. In all patients AVDO2 remained constant both before and after HBO. Levels of CSF lactate were consistently decreased 1 hour and 6 hours after HBO, regardless of the patient's CBF category before undergoing HBO (p < 0.05). Intracranial pressure values higher than 15 mm Hg before HBO were decreased 1 hour and 6 hours after HBO (p < 0.05). The effects of each HBO treatment did not last until the next session in the hyperbaric chamber.

   CONCLUSIONS: The increased CMRO2 and decreased CSF lactate levels after treatment indicate that HBO may improve aerobic metabolism in severely brain injured patients. This is the first study to demonstrate a prolonged effect of HBO treatment on CBF and cerebral metabolism. On the basis of their data the authors assert that shorter, more frequent exposure to HBO may optimize treatment.

Abstract
  More than million people/year die after head injury. The cause of death in 50% is the secondary brain swelling with incuneation. Today decompressive craniectomy with durotomy for traumatic brain swelling is performed as second--tier therapy at many clinics and hospitals. The literature mentions this method only as an option. The problem so far existed in the following fact: although the above mentioned method successfully diminished the ICP still despite this result, partial or total lesion occurred in the herniated part of the brain. The actual cause of these symptoms is found in the blockage of the veins and arteries, caused by shearing and compressive forces between the dural edge and brain tissue. Venous congestion induces further edema in the protruding parts of the brain, thus causing lesion by strangulated necrosis and hypoxia. The new surgical technique consists of a stellate manner durotomy and of creating a vascular tunnel by supporting pilasters made of haemostatic sponge around the main cortical veins and arteries of herniated brain. With the help of new technique the authors managed not only to reduce the intracranial pressure significantly but they could avoid further edema and vascular lesion as well. This due to the fact that with this method we assure the blood circulation and venous drainage of the herniated part of the brain. We think, that in this case despite of the initially severe status, the properly indicated combination of craniectomy, durotomy and vascular tunnel creation, could be the main factor of the surprisingly favorable outcome.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Impairment of cerebral autoregulation (CA) appears to be an important cause for secondary ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It has been shown that graded CA impairment is predictive of outcome. Little is known about whether such impairment is present, what causes CA impairment, whether it precedes vasospasm, and whether it is predictive of outcome in patients with severe aneurysmal SAH.

   DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study.

   SETTING: Neurosurgical intensive care unit.

   PATIENTS: Twelve patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 40 controls.

   INTERVENTIONS: Recording of cerebral blood flow velocities and continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure at a controlled ventilatory frequency of six per minute to standardize the influence of intrathoracic pressure changes on blood pressure.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We calculated the phase shift angles (deltaphidegrees) between slow (0.1 Hz) arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity waves measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound in the middle cerebral artery during a) posthemorrhage days (PHD) 1-6 (early or prevasospasm phase), and b) during PHD 7-13 (late or vasospasm phase) using a 6/min ventilation protocol, and in 40 controls spontaneously ventilating at the same rate. deltaphi <30 degrees indicated lost CA. Mean flow velocities >100 cm/sec were considered vasospasm. We combined early and late measurements to assess the CA relationship with low cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and/or vasospasm. We assessed the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at discharge (1 = worst, 5 = best). The admission Hunt and Hess score was 3.6 +/- 0.7. GOS scores were n = 3 (GOS 1), n = 2 (GOS 2), n = 5 (GOS 3), n = 1 (GOS 4), and n = 1 (GOS 5). In the early phase, deltaphi was 40.4 +/- 19.8 degrees (left), and 40.4 +/- 19.2 degrees (right). CPP was 69.4 +/- 10.9, intracranial pressure (ICP) was 6.7 +/- 2.8 mm Hg. In the late phase, deltaphi worsened in six patients and none improved: 32.1 +/- 21 degrees (left), and 26.9 +/- 17.2 degrees (right); CPP was 68.1 +/- 12.1, ICP was 7.5 +/- 3.7 mm Hg. CA was significantly impaired in both phases when compared with normal subjects (deltaphi: 65.7 +/- 24.5 degrees; p < .01 for early, p < .001 for late phase). In the early phase, seven of eight patients in whom autoregulation was intact had a GOS >2 at discharge and disturbed CA on at least one side was predictive of either vegetative condition at discharge or death (p < .01). In the late phase, deltaphi was no longer predictive of outcome. Spasm was present in 8 of 17 vessels (47%) in which CA was lost; no spasm was found in 25 of 28 vessels (89%) in which CA was intact (p < .01). A low CPP was present in 6 of 17 vessels (35%) in which CA was lost; a normal CPP was found in 21 of 27 vessels (78%) in which CA was intact (p > .05, NS). However, 14 of 17 vessels (82%) with lost CA showed spasm and/or low CPP while only 8 of 27 cases (30%) with intact CA had either spasm or low CPP (p < .001).

   CONCLUSIONS: CA can be assessed in a graded fashion in SAH patients. CA impairment precedes vasospasm; ongoing vasospasm worsens CA. CA assessment early after subarachnoid hemorrhage, within PHD 1-6, is predictive of outcome whereas late assessment is not. CA impairment is associated with cerebral vasospasm and low CPP.

Abstract
  The prognosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is variable, and outcome may range from complete recovery to death. Prognostic factors to predict outcome in the acute phase of CVST have not been analysed in a prospective study. Prognostic factors in patients enrolled in a clinical treatment trial were prospectively investigated. Poor outcome after 12 weeks, defined as death or dependency (Oxford handicap score > or =3), was used as the principle outcome measure. Univariate relations between possible prognostic factors and outcome at 12 weeks were analyzed with chi(2) tests. Treatment and all factors associated with prognosis (p< or = 0.25) were forced into a logistic regression model with a forward selection procedure. Fifty nine patients (50 women, nine men) were studied, with a mean age of 37 years (range 18 to 80 years). After 12 weeks 10 patients (17%) had a poor outcome. The univariate identified factors related to poor outcome were papilloedema, altered consciousness, coma, age older than 33 years, diagnostic delay < or =10 days, intracerebral haemorrhage, and involvement of the straight sinus. Isolated intracranial hypertension and a delta sign on CT were associated with good outcome. In the multivariate analysis coma and cerebral haemorrhage were significantly associated with a poor outcome, with odds ratios of 8.2 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1. 3-50.1) and 20.7 (95% CI 1.6-264.3) respectively. Involvement of the straight sinus was also weakly, but not significantly, associated with poor outcome. In conclusion, coma and intracerebral haemorrhage are independent predictors for poor outcome of CVST.

Abstract
  A subset of hydrocephalic patients with indwelling shunts become symptomatic when they are upright and active. Intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements in these patients have shown a significant drop in pressure when the patient is upright with return to normal levels when the patient is supine. In 20 chronically shunted hydrocephalic patients who previously had no siphon protection devices, ICP changes in supine and upright position were studied at the time when the patient had external ventriculostomy for treatment of shunt infection. Our hypothesis was that these patients might display rapid changes in ICP from fluid shifts occurring in non-CSF compartments. To minimize the effects of hysteresis, drift and zero-point error, measurements were made using a fluid manometer rather than a strain gauge pressure transducer. The pressure-volume index was estimated using the standard technique of bolus injection. Intracranial CSF volume was estimated on CT scans. The fluid shift was calculated using a mathematical model of the CSF compartment that incorporates negative pressure and volume components that permits simulation of siphoning. Sixteen patients had small, slit ventricles; 3 patients had moderate-sized ventricles and in 1 patient the ventricular size was normal. The average intracranial CSF volume estimated on CT scan was 12 cm(3). There was a mean drop in ICP in the upright position of 159 mm H(2)O. The mean PVI of 42 ml suggested a volume displacement out of proportion to the available intracranial CSF volume. Based on these findings, we conclude that even in the absence of drainage through the shunt, chronically shunted patients still display a fall in ICP when assuming the upright position. This raises the possibility of fluid shifts other than of CSF through nonshunt pathways. Possible mechanisms involving altered CSF-venous system interaction are discussed. Copyright 2000 S.

Abstract
  OBJECT: The purpose of this study is to clarify the whole pressure environment of the ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt system in patients with successfully treated hydrocephalus and to determine which factor of the pressure environment has a preventive effect on overdrainage.

   METHODS: Thirteen patients with hydrocephalus who had been treated with VP shunt therapy by using a Codman-Hakim programmable valve without incidence of overdrainage were examined. The authors evaluated intracranial pressure (ICP), intraabdominal pressure (IAP), hydrostatic pressure (HP), and the perfusion pressure (PP) of the shunt system with the patients both supine and sitting. With patients supine, ICP, IAP, and HP were 4.6 +/- 3 mm Hg, 5.7 +/- 3.3 mm Hg, and 3.3 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. As a result, the PP was only 2.2 +/- 4.9 mm Hg. When the patients sat up, the IAP increased to 14.7 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, and ICP decreased to-- 14.2 +/- 4.5 mm Hg. The increased IAP and decreased ICP offset 67% of the HP (42.9 +/- 3.5 mm Hg), and consequently the PP (14 +/- 6.3 mm Hg) corresponded to only 33% of HP.

   CONCLUSIONS: The results observed in patients indicated that IAP as well as ICP play an important role in VP shunt therapy and that the increased IAP and the decreased ICP in patients placed in the upright position allow them to adapt to the siphoning effect and for overdrainage thereby to be avoided.

Abstract
  Since 1995 a Group of Italian Neurointensivists and Neurosurgeons belonging to the Italian Societies of Neurosurgery (SINch) and Anesthesia & Intensive Care (SIAARTI) has produced some recommendations for treatment of adults with severe head trauma. They have been published in 3 parts: Part I (Initial assessment, Evaluation and pre-hospital treatment, Criteria for hospital admission, Systemic and cerebral monitoring), Part II (Medical treatment) and Part III (Surgical treatment criteria). These recommendations reflect a multidisciplinary consent and are mostly based on expert opinion. The main aim is to provide a practical reference for all those dealing with severe head injuries from first-aid to intensive care units, setting out the minimal goals of management to be reached throughout the Country. These recommendations need a continuous critical review and updating. Medical treatment is aimed at preventing or minimizing secondary brain damage following acute brain injury, provided that surgical masses have been promptly identified and removed. In order to assure cerebral perfusion, systemic hemodynamics and respiratory exchanges should be normal. Volemia is crucial, and mean arterial pressure should remain above 90 mmHg. Good general intensive care, including gastroprotection, water-electrolyte balance, infection control, nutrition and physiotherapy, is assumed as the basis for brain-oriented therapy. Intracranial hypertension requires an approach based on various steps. First, factors that can directly rise intracranial pressure (ICP) such as venous outflow obstruction, fever, pain etc. should be checked and corrected. Second, Mannitol, CSF withdrawal, sedation and moderate hyperventilation should be applied. This can be done by targeting specific problems with specific treatment (which is possible when the cause of ICP rise is known) or in a step-wise approach, by using less aggressive interventions before than more aggressive ones, with a higher risk of complications. Third, extreme treatment, such as barbiturates, should be reserved to cases with refractory intracranial hypertension. The main goal of ICP treatment is not simply ICP reduction, but the maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion pressure.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, main physiologic effects, and therapeutic management of the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) after severe abdominal and/or pelvic trauma.

   DESIGN: Retrospective analysis from January 1991 to December 1996; prospective study from January 1997 to August 1998.

   SETTING: Level I trauma center, intensive care unit.

   PATIENTS: A total of 311 patients with severe abdominal and/or pelvic trauma and "damage-control" laparotomy on day of admission.

   INTERVENTIONS: The ACS was defined as the development of significant respiratory compromise, including elevated inspiratory pressure of >35 mbar, a decreased Horowitz quotient (<150 torr [<20 kPa]), renal dysfunction (urine output, <30 mL/hr), hemodynamic instability necessitating catecholamines, and a rigid or tense abdomen. Beginning with January 1997, urinary bladder pressure as an additional variable for the diagnosis of ACS was continuously measured in patients (n = 12) at risk. Bladder pressures of >25 mm Hg indicated ACS.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen patients (5.5%) developed ACS because of persistent intra-abdominal/retroperitoneal bleeding (n = 12; 70.6%) or visceral edema (n = 5; 29.4%). All patients with ACS underwent primary fascial closure. In eight of these patients (47%), abdominal and/or pelvic packing for hemostasis was performed. All patients with ACS required decompressive emergency laparotomies because of physiologic derangements. The time between primary laparotomy and decompressive laparotomy was 12.9 +/- 2.0 hrs. Emergency decompression of the abdomen resulted in a significant increase in the cardiac index (+146%), tidal volume (+133%), Horowitz quotient (+156%), and urine output (+1557%), whereas bladder pressure (-63%), heart rate (-19%), central venous pressure (-30%), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (-43%), peak airway pressure (-31%), partial pressure arterial carbon dioxide (-30%), and lactate (-40%) markedly (p < .05) decreased. In two multiply injured patients with additional head trauma, ACS caused a critical increase of the intracranial pressure, which markedly dropped after the release of abdominal tension.

   CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for the occurrence of ACS are severe abdominal and/or pelvic trauma, which require laparotomy and packing for the control of hemorrhage. The ACS occurs within hours and causes life-threatening physiologic derangements and a critical rise in intracranial pressure in patients with combined abdominal/pelvic and head trauma. Decompressive laparotomy immediately restores impaired organ functions. In patients at risk, the continuous measurement of urinary bladder pressure as a simple, noninvasive, and less expensive diagnostic tool for early detection of elevated intra-abdominal pressure is mandatory.

Abstract
  In contrast to arterial stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an infrequent condition which presents with a wide spectrum of signs and with a highly variable mode of onset. The clinician must therefore consider it systematically in all brain syndromes and perform the appropriate neuroimaging investigations: computed tomography (CT) with computed tomography angiography and/or magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography and, if necessary intra-arterial angiography. Once the diagnosis is established, a wide investigation for should be carried out in search of the cause, and treatment started as soon as possible. Treatment is based on the combination of intravenous heparin (followed by oral anticoagulants for 3-6 months), symptomatic treatment (anticonvulsants, analgesics, treatment of increased intracranial pressure) and treatment of the cause. Local thrombolysis is indicated if there is deterioration due to thrombosis extension despite adequate anticoagulation. Diagnosis and treatment of CVT should be considered as an emergency because of the considerable potential for full recovery in this condition. [References: 14]

Abstract
  The main goal at the acute phase of head injury is to prevent a decrease in blood pressure, which promotes cerebral ischemia. Volume loading is therefore frequently indicated. A normal or increased plasma osmolarity should be maintained. Thus hypotonic fluids should be avoided. Hyperglycaemia is also a risk factor for brain injury and glucose use has to be restricted in the first hours after trauma. Isotonic saline 0.9% is the first solution to be infused. Lactated Ringer solutions are mildly hypotonic as approximately 114 mL of free water is contained in each litre of the solution. Isotonic colloids are indicated to replace blood losses, but have no advantage over cristalloids, concerning the development of cerebral oedema. Fluid restriction minimally affects cerebral edema. Because of the severe consequences of hypovolaemia and hypotension, fluids should not be restricted until haemodynamic stability is achieved. Hypertonic fluids rapidly restore intravascular volume and decrease intracranial pressure. Although they probably have a place in prehospital intensive therapy, the demonstration of their benefit is still lacking. Monitoring of intravascular volume is essential. Continuous arterial pressure and central venous pressure monitoring are mandatory. New monitoring techniques as the measurement of systolic pressure variations or transoesophageal Doppler echocardiography will probably find a place in the management of trauma patients in the near future.

Abstract
  Monitoring of severely head-injured patients is essential to optimize cerebral haemodynamics and thus to limit intracranial hypertension and to prevent the occurrence of secondary systemic cerebral injuries. It includes continuous measurement of intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure and venous jugular oxygen saturation. Assessment of circulatory velocity in the arteries of the polygon of Willis allows identification of intracranial hypertension, and later, a vasospasm in case of subarachnoid haemorrhage. Near infrared spectroscopy is an indirect indicator of cerebral oxygenation. This technique has not yet been validated. Direct tissue measurement of cerebral oxygen content is the most recently developed monitoring tool. Its clinical range of application has still to be specified. These basic monitoring techniques are a standard. They are essential for an undelayed and efficient treatment of complications occurring in head trauma patients. [References: 37]

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of prolonged infusion of 3% hypertonic saline (514 mEq/L) and sustained hypernatremia on refractory intracranial hypertension in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients.

   DESIGN: A prospective study.

   SETTING: A 24-bed Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (Level III) at Children's Hospital.

   PATIENTS: We present ten children with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) resistant to conventional therapy (head elevation at 30 degrees, normothermia, sedation, paralysis and analgesia, osmolar therapy with mannitol, loop diuretic, external ventricular drainage in five patients), controlled hyperventilation (Pco2, 28-35 mm Hg), and barbiturate coma. We continuously monitored ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, serum sodium concentrations, serum osmolarity, and serum creatinine.

   INTERVENTIONS: A continuous infusion of 3% saline on a sliding scale was used to achieve a target serum sodium level that would maintain ICP <20 mm Hg once the conventional therapy and barbiturate coma as outlined above failed to control intracranial hypertension.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean duration of treatment with 3% saline was 7.6 days (range, 4-18 days). The mean highest serum sodium was 170.7 mEq/L (range, 157-187 mEq/L). The mean highest serum osmolarity was 364.8 mosm/L (range, 330-431 mosm/L). The mean highest serum creatinine was 1.31 mg/dL (range, 0.4-5.0 mg/dL). There was a steady increase in serum sodium versus time zero that reached statistical significance at 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). There was a statistically significant decrease in ICP spike frequency at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). There was a statistically significant increase in CPP versus time zero at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). There was a statistically significant increase in serum osmolarity versus time zero at 12 hrs (p < .05) and at 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). Two patients developed acute renal failure and required continuous veno-venous hemodialysis; these were concurrent with an episode of sepsis and multisystem organ dysfunction. Both recovered full renal function with no electrolyte abnormalities at the time of discharge.

   CONCLUSION: An increase in serum sodium concentration significantly decreases ICP and increases CPP. Hypertonic saline is an effective agent to increase serum sodium concentrations. Sustained hypernatremia and hyperosmolarity are safely tolerated in pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury. Controlled trials are needed before recommendation of widespread use.

Abstract
  The genetics of achondroplasia are discussed, and then the clinical features. The respiratory complications are only considered when related to the neurological ones which are the concern of this paper; and their effects on morbidity and mortality. Cervicomedullary compression can cause pain, ataxia, incontinence, apnea, and respiratory arrest. One of the signs can be progressive quadriparesis which can be a presenting symptom; and may be caused by a vascular lesion as well as by cord compression. Also nerve root compression in the neural foramina can cause symptoms and signs in the limbs. Enlargement of the head is a feature of achondroplasia. This may be due to subdural haematoma related to the wide subarachnoid spaces, and to trauma. Hydrocephalus is common, and may be non-communicating and due to aqueduct stenosis, but is much more often communicating and the result of raised intracranial venous pressure. Shunting may be necessary, but surgery directed towards relieving the venous pressure may be more logical. Otitis media often affects these children, and can cause deafness and subsequently delayed language development. Sleep disturbances can be the result of both neurological and respiratory complications. Apart from the treatment for hydrocephalus the most important decision is often the question of operating on the cervical medullary compression. Risk factors such as brisk reflexes, small foramen magnum, and central hypopnea, can be an indication for surgery; but timing can be difficult as the cord compression can resolve spontaneously. The intelligence levels of these children are usually normal, and studies have shown a surprisingly high level of satisfaction with the services provided. [References: 19]

Abstract
  OBJECT: Head elevation as a treatment for lower intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with intracranial hypertension has been challenged in recent years. Therefore, the authors studied the effect of head position on cerebral hemodynamics in patients with severe head injury.

   METHODS: The effect of 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees head elevation on ICP, cerebral blood flow (CBF), systemic arterial (PsaMonro) and jugular bulb (Pj) pressures calibrated to the level of the foramen of Monro, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and the arteriovenous pressure gradient (PsaMonro - Pj) was studied in 37 patients who were comatose due to severe intracranial lesions. The CBF decreased gradually with head elevation from 0 to 45 degrees, from 46.3+/-4.8 to 28.7+/-2.3 ml x min(-1) x 100 g(-1) (mean +/- standard error, p<0.01), and the PsaMonro - Pj from 80+/-3 to 73+/-3 mm Hg (p< 0.01). The CPP remained stable between 0 degrees and 30 degrees of head elevation, at 62+/-3 mm Hg, and decreased from 62+/-3 to 57+/-4 mm Hg between 30 degrees and 45 degrees (p<0.05). A simulation showed that the 38% decrease in CBF between 0 degrees and 45 degrees resulted from PsaMonro - Pj changes for 19% of the decrease, from a diversion of the venous drainage from the internal jugular veins to vertebral venous plexus for 15%, and from CPP changes for 4%.

   CONCLUSIONS: During head elevation the arteriovenous pressure gradient is the major determinant of CBF. The influence of CPP on CBF decreases from 0 to 45 degrees of head elevation.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Only few anecdotal reports and small series of thalamic cavernous malformations have been reported. It follows that the clinical behavior and management are poorly understood; in particular, experiences with the surgical treatment of these lesions are scarce.

   METHODS: The clinical course, treatment, and outcome of 12 patients (10 females and 2 males, mean age 36 years) with symptomatic cavernous malformations of the thalamus are reviewed. Eight patients (66%) presented with cerebral hemorrhage, one with progressive neurological deficit and three with hydrocephalus/increased intracranial pressure; associated venous anomalies were found in three cases. Treatment consisted of radical surgery in four cases with progressive neurological decline or recurrent disabling hemorrhage, radiosurgery (one case), evacuation of a chronic satellite hematoma (one case), ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus (one case) and observation (five cases). Operative treatment in four cases included transcallosal, trigonal, and occipital interhemispheric approaches.

   RESULTS: In the surgical group, one patient died, two improved after operation, and one remained the same. Of the patients not operated on radically, one had recurrent hemorrhage 4 months after radiosurgery, one remains stable 8 years after ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and one 3 years after aspiration of a satellite hematoma. Five other patients presenting with thalamic hemorrhage were treated conservatively; recurrent hemorrhage occurred in two cases at 1 month and at 2 years, leaving a mild residual deficit in both cases. Overall, rehemorrhage occurred in four cases (50%) at a mean interval of 18 months after the first bleeding; the annual hemorrhage rate was 6.1%.

   CONCLUSIONS: Thalamic malformations are more likely to be symptomatic from small hemorrhages compared with lesions in the cerebral hemispheres; progressive growth may also occur with third ventricle invasion or caudal extension to the midbrain. Their high-risk location deters heavy-handed management, but they should not be left long untreated. Both surgery and radiosurgery have been used in the management of thalamic cavernomas reported in the literature. Definite surgical indications include progressive neurological decline and recurrent hemorrhages of malformations abutting the ventricular surface or the posterior incisural space; the complex anatomy of the deep venous system and the association with unexpected venous anomalies complicates the removal of these lesions.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: To report a case of partial transverse venous sinus obstruction causing a syndrome resembling pseudotumor cerebri.

   METHOD: Case report. A 61-year-old man developed decreased vision, bilateral papilledema, and a highly increased cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed a small, extra-axial mass near the torcula, which was dismissed as an incidental meningioma because cerebral angiography showed sinus patency.

   RESULTS: The patient's vision worsened. Biopsy of the enlarging mass disclosed metastatic prostate cancer. After radiation therapy, the mass shrank, magnetic resonance angiography disclosed reopening of the transverse sinuses, and papilledema resolved, but visual fields remained severely compromised.

   CONCLUSION: Partial blockage of the dural venous sinus by a small mass near the torcula can cause a sufficient increase in intracranial pressure to produce vision-threatening papilledema.

Abstract
  Mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may prevent venous air embolism in the sitting position because cerebral venous pressure (Pcev) could be increased by the PEEP-induced increase in right atrial pressure (Pra). Whereas it is clear that there is a linear transmission of the PEEP-induced increase in Pra to Pcev while the dog is in the prone position, the mechanism of the transmission with the dog in the head-elevated position is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that a Starling resistor-type mechanism exists in the jugular veins when the head is elevated. In one group of dogs, increasing PEEP linearly increased Pcev with the dog in the prone position (head at heart level, slope = 0.851) but did not increase Pcev when the head was elevated. In another group of dogs, an external chest binder was used to produce a larger PEEP-induced increase in Pra. Further increasing Pra increased Pcev only after Pra exceeded a pressure of 19 mmHg (break pressure). This sharp inflection in the upstream (Pcev)-downstream (Pra) relationship suggests that this may be caused by a Starling resistor-type mechanism. We conclude that jugular venous collapse serves as a significant resistance in the transmission of Pra to Pcev in the head-elevated position.

Abstract
  We report the case of a 70-year-old man reporting with headache and visual disturbances who was being treated for prostate cancer. Investigations showed him to have intracranial hypertension caused by venous sinus obstruction. Patients with metastatic disease and raised intracranial pressure in the absence of focal signs should be considered as possible cases of venous outflow obstruction.

Abstract
  In this article, we describe a case of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in an acute severe asthma patient following mechanical hypoventilation. A 49-year-old man was admitted to an Intensive Care Unit with an acute exacerbation of asthma. After 3 days of mechanical ventilation (hypercapnia and normoxaemia), it was noted that his right pupil was fixed, dilated, and unreactive to light. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed localized SAH within the basilar cisterns and diffuse cerebral swelling. On the fourth day, a new CT scan showed hemorrhage resorption and a cerebral swelling decrease. In the following days, the patient's condition continued improving with no detectable neurological deficits. A review of similar published reports showed that all patients performed respiratory acidosis, normoxaemia, and hypercapnia. The most frequent neurological sign was mydriasis, and all subjects showed cerebral edema. Since normoxaemic hypercapnia has been associated with absence, or less cerebral edema, we considered additional factors to explain cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension causes. Thus, intrathoracic pressures due to patient's efforts by forcibly exhaling, or during mechanical ventilation, would further increase intracranial pressure by limiting cerebral venous drainage. This case emphasizes the fact that patients with acute severe asthma who have developed profoundly hypercarbic without hypoxia before or during mechanical ventilation, may have raised critical intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  Transcranial dopplerography was performed in 125 children with late (1-3 years) neurologic sequelae of acute neuroinfections. Decreased blood flow velocity (BFV) in middle cerebral arteries of (0.61 of the value in control group) was found in patients with movement disorders. Impairment of the intracranial venous outflow together with both acceleration and asymmetry of blood flow in basal veins was prevalent in children with intracranial hypertension and hydrocephaly syndrome. Hyperconstriction of cerebral vessels together with a low BFV (30% of the initial value) was observed during hyperventilation on the side of the lesion in patients with epileptic syndrome. In children with cerebrasthenic syndrome the effect of cavinton treatment depended on the type of changes in cerebral blood flow: positive effect was found in patients with asymmetric decrease of BFV in anterior cerebral arteries.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is often overlooked when intracranial hypertension (ICH) is isolated, hence mimicking idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

   OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of patients with CVT and ICH.

   METHODS: We examined 160 consecutive patients with CVT between 1975 and 1998. They were separated into two groups according to their clinical presentation--isolated ICH and other neurologic symptoms and signs.

   RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients with CVT (37%) presented with isolated ICH. Neuroimaging showed involvement of more than one sinus in 35 patients (59%). Brain CT was normal in 27 of 50 patients (54%). Lumbar puncture was performed in 44 patients and showed elevated opening pressure in 25 of 32 (78%) and abnormal CSF content in 11 (25%). Etiologies and risk factors included local causes in 7 of 59 (12%), surgery in 1, inflammatory diseases in 18 (30.5%), infection in 2, cancer in 1, postpartum state in 1, coagulopathies in 11 (19%), oral contraception in 7 (12%), and remained unknown in 11 (19%). Anticoagulants were used in 41 of 59 patients (69.5%), steroids or acetazolamide in 26 (44%), therapeutic lumbar puncture in 44 (75%), and surgical shunt in 1. Three patients had optic atrophy with severe visual loss, 1 died from carcinomatous meningitis, and 55 (93%) had complete recovery.

   CONCLUSIONS: Central venous thrombosis (CVT) can present with all the classical criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), including normal brain CT with normal CSF content. Because the recognition of CVT has crucial prognostic and therapeutic implications, MRI, with magnetic resonance venography when necessary, should be performed in patients with isolated intracranial hypertension. The outcome of CVT is unpredictable, and management of patients with CVT should not differ whether they present with isolated raised intracranial pressure or with other neurologic symptoms and signs. Therefore, isolated raised intracranial pressure from CVT differs in management from IIH and should be classified neither as "IIH" nor "pseudotumor cerebri."

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: VARIABLE EXPRESSION: The clinical expression of cerebral venous thrombosis varies widely. The only manifestation may be an intracranial hypertension if the thrombus is limited to the superior longitudinal sinus or a predominant lateral sinus. Thrombosis of cortical veins, alone or in association with a sinus thrombus causes venous infarction.

   PROGNOSIS: Deep venous thrombosis generally leads to coma with signs of intracranial hypertension. However, partial or complete recovery is possible, even with a severe initial presentation, underlining the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.

   DIAGNOSTIC METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coupled with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can usually confirm the diagnosis without conventional angiography. ETIOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: Cerebral venous thrombosis often follows prethrombotic conditions. Infectious causes only account for 10% of the cases and no cause can be identified in about 1 out of 5 cases.

   TREATMENT: Anticoagulation is indicated even in case of venous infarction with spontaneous bleeding. Thrombolysis can be proposed, particularly for deep venous thrombosis. [References: 41]

Abstract
  This case reports on a fatal craniocerebral trauma involving numerous ruptured cerebral bridging veins that did not bleed subdurally, despite approximately 15 hours of survival. A 15-year-old girl was severely injured as the passenger of a car that crashed sideways into a tree. She-suffered a cerebral trauma of the "diffuse injury" type and was unconscious after the accident. Her computed tomographic scan at admission showed massive brain edema, axial herniation, and marked hypodensity of the bilateral carotid flow area. Despite intensive care measures, the clinical course was characterized by central decompensation with therapy-resistant cardiocirculatory insufficiency. The autopsy revealed ruptures of numerous parasagittal bridging veins. The injured vessels were not thrombosed, and yet there was absolutely no subdural bleeding. This unusual combination of findings is assumed to be caused by an isolated collapse of cerebral circulation occurring shortly after the accident and primarily attributed to a rapid increase of intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  OBJECT: The goal of this study was to document the hazards associated with pseudotumor cerebri resulting from transverse sinus thrombosis after tumor resection. Dural sinus thrombosis is a rare and potentially serious complication of suboccipital craniotomy and translabyrinthine craniectomy. Pseudotumor cerebri may occur when venous hypertension develops secondary to outflow obstruction. Previous research indicates that occlusion of a single transverse sinus is well tolerated when the contralateral sinus remains patent.

   METHODS: The authors report the results in five of a total of 107 patients who underwent suboccipital craniotomy or translabyrinthine craniectomy for resection of a tumor. Postoperatively, these patients developed headache, visual obscuration, and florid papilledema as a result of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). In each patient, the transverse sinus on the treated side was thrombosed; patency of the contralateral sinus was confirmed on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Four patients required lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal shunts and one required medical treatment for increased ICP. All five patients regained their baseline neurological function after treatment. Techniques used to avoid thrombosis during surgery are discussed.

   CONCLUSIONS: First, the status of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses should be documented using MR venography before patients undergo posterior fossa surgery. Second, thrombosis of a transverse or sigmoid sinus may not be tolerated even if the sinus is nondominant; vision-threatening pseudotumor cerebri may result. Third, MR venography is a reliable, noninvasive means of evaluating the venous sinuses. Fourth, if the diagnosis is made shortly after thrombosis, then direct endovascular thrombolysis with urokinase may be a therapeutic option. If the presentation is delayed, then ophthalmological complications of pseudotumor cerebri can be avoided by administration of a combination of acetazolamide, dexamethasone, lumbar puncture, and possibly lumboperitoneal shunt placement.

Abstract
  Preclinical safety and efficacy evaluation of a novel bioartificial liver support system (BLSS) was conducted using a D-galactosamine canine liver failure model. The BLSS houses a suspension of porcine hepatocytes in a hollow fiber cartridge with the hepatocytes on one side of the membrane and whole blood flowing on the other. Porcine hepatocytes harvested by a collagenase digestion technique were infused into the hollow fiber cartridge and incubated for 16 to 24 hours prior to use. Fifteen purpose-bred male hounds, 1-3 years old, 25-30 kg, were administered a lethal dose, 1.5 g/kg, of D-galactosamine. The animals were divided into three treatment groups: (1b) no BLSS treatment (n = 6); (2b) BLSS treatment starting at 24-26 h post D-galactosamine (n = 5); and (2c) BLSS treatment starting at 16-18 h post D-galactosamine (n = 4). While maintained under isoflurane anesthesia, canine supportive care was guided by electrolyte and invasive physiologic monitoring consisting of arterial pressure, central venous pressure, extradural intracranial pressure (ICP), pulmonary artery pressure, urinary catheter, and end-tidal CO2. All animals were treated until death or death-equivalent (inability to sustain systolic blood pressure > 80 mmHg for 20 minutes despite massive fluid resuscitation and/or dopamine administration), or euthanized at 60 hours. All animals developed evidence of liver failure at 12-24 hours as evidenced by blood pressure lability, elevated ICP, marked hepatocellular enzyme elevation with microscopic massive hepatocyte necrosis and cerebral edema, elevated prothrombin time, and metabolic acidosis. Groups 2b and 2c marginally prolong survival compared with Group 1b (pairwise log rank censored survival time analysis, p = 0.096 and p = 0.064, respectively). Since survival times for Groups 2b and 2c are not significantly different (p = 0.694), the groups were combined for further statistical analysis. Survival times for the combined active treatment Groups 2b and 2c are significantly prolonged versus Group 1b (p = 0.047). These results suggest the novel BLSS reported here can have a significant impact on the course of liver failure in the D-galactosamine canine liver failure model. The BLSS is ready for Phase I safety evaluation in a clinical setting.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: To determine the ability of an externally applied continuous negative abdominal pressure device (CNAP) to reverse the effects of elevated intra-abdominal pressure on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems.

   METHODS: Anesthetized, ventilated swine had catheters placed for measurement of intra-abdominal (IAP), intracranial (ICP), central venous, pulmonary artery, pulmonary artery occlusion, mean arterial, peak inspiratory, inferior vena cava, and femoral vein pressures. After the animals stabilized, baseline measurements were obtained. IAP was increased by incrementally instilling an isosmotic polyethylene glycol solution into the peritoneal cavity until it was 25 mm Hg above baseline. IAP was maintained at 25 mm Hg above baseline for 2 hours. CNAP was then applied for 2 hours. All parameters were remeasured 30 minutes after each increase in IAP, at 2 hours after attaining maximum IAP, and lastly at 2 hours after abdominal decompression. Cardiac index was maintained near baseline by volume expansion.

   RESULTS: Elevation of IAP to 25 mm Hg above baseline for 2 hours caused increases (p<0.05) in central venous pressure (10.3+/-0.9 to 15.2+/-1.7), inferior vena cava pressure (13.0+/-1.0 to 29.5+/-1.5), femoral vein pressure (13.5+/-0.5 to 33.3+/-1.3), ICP (10.6+/-1.5 to 21.0+/-1.5), and peak inspiratory pressure (18.3+/-0.3 to 34.2+/-1.0). The mean arterial pressure (106.3+/-3.5 to 125.8+/-3.4), pulmonary artery pressure (24.3+/-2.3 to 31.3+/-1.7), and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure rose (12.3+/-0.9 to 17.5+/-3.5), but not significantly. Cardiac index (3.3+/-0.5 to 3.4+/-0.4) remained essentially unchanged. CNAP significantly (p<0.05) decreased IAP (30.7+/-1.3 to 18.2+/-1.3), central venous pressure (15.2+/-1.7 to 12.4+/-2.1), inferior vena cava (29.5+/-1.5 to 19.2+/-1.3), and ICP (21.0+/-1.5 to 16.2+/-1.3). Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (17.5+/-3.5 to 15.0+/-3.1) and peak inspiratory pressure (34.2+/-1.0 to 29.7+/-1.1) decreased, but not significantly.

   CONCLUSION: Acutely elevated IAP causes a significant increase in ICP and impaired cardiovascular and pulmonary function. Abdominal decompression remains the standard of care for abdominal compartment syndrome. However, in patients in whom an increased IAP does not require surgical decompression, the results of this study suggest that externally applied CNAP may be of value.

Abstract
  Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) can cause cerebral venous hypertension (VHT). The most common mechanism is due to the fact that some dAVFs can drain retrogradelly in cortical (better defined as leptomeningeal) veins (directly or after drainage in a dural sinus) causing venous engorgement and consequently an impairment of the cerebral venous drainage. However, more rarely, dAVFs without a cortical venous drainage can also be responsible for VHT probably due to dAVF shunts causing insufficient antegrade cerebral venous drainage. In addition, dAVFs are often associated with stenosis and/or thrombosis of dural sinus(es) which can worsen the VHT. Raised pressure within the superior sagittal sinus causes impeded cerebrospinal reabsorption in the arachnoid villi allowing increased intracranial pressure. The venous engorgement in the cortical veins can cause a venous congestive encephalopathy analogous to the venous congestive myelopathy of the spinal dural AVFs. Clinically VHT can cause not only symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure but also seizures, neurological deficits, impairment of the cognitive functions and dementia. An important aspect is the risk of hemorrhage in dAVFs with a leptomeningeal venous drainage leading to VHT. Although the term VHT sensu strictu should be used if venous pressure measurements are performed, angiographic criteria for VHT such as delayed circulation time, venous engorgement and abnormal visualization of the cerebral veins are well established. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the angiographic signs of VHT in patients with dAVF and to study the course of the VHT and of the clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure before and after dAVF endovascular treatment. A retrospective chart analysis of 22 patients (13 males, 9 females) ranging in age from 20 to 87 years (mean: 53 ys.) with a dAVF associated with angiographic signs of VHT was performed. Ten dAVFs were located on the transverse/sigmoid sinus(es), 6 on the superior sagittal sinus, 3 on the petro-tentorial incisura, 1 on the inferior petrosal sinus, 1 on the anterior ethmoidal region and 1 on the Galen vein region. All dAVFs had a retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage. Stenosis or thrombosis of the dural AVF sinus was observed in 17 cases and stenosis or thrombosis of another sinus(es) and/or of the jugular vein in 8 cases. In 11 patients, the angiographic signs of VHT were global affecting the entire cerebral venous drainage and, in the other 11 patients, the VHT was focal. The VHT caused clinical symptoms of increased intracranial pressure in 18 patients. Other clinical findings included: bruit (11 cases), seizures (3 cases), vertigo (3 cases), visual deficits (2 cases) and impairment of cognitive functions (4 cases). Three patients presented hemorrhage (one parenchymal hematoma, one hemorrhagic infarction and one subarachnoid hemorrhage). The 4 patients without clinical symptoms of increased intracranial pressure presented only bruit in 2 cases, bruit and vertigo in 1 case, bruit and hemorrhagic infarction in another one. The dAVFs were treated by endovascular therapy (arterial approach: 3 cases, venous approach: 6 cases and both arterial and venous approach: 13 cases). Endovascular sessions ranged from 1 to 7 (mean: 2.8) for each patient. After the endovascular treatment, in 12 patients with complete occlusion of the dAVF, the disappearance of angiographic signs of VHT and clinical cure were observed. In 8 patients with partial occlusion of the dAVF, the disappearance of angiographic signs of VHT and clinical cure were observed in 4 cases (almost complete dAVF occlusion in 2 cases); in the other 4 cases, only reduction the angiographic signs of VHT and clinical improvement were obtained. In all 16 patients who were clinically cured angiographic signs of VHT disappeared despite the persistence of dAVF shunts as observed in 4 cases. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Mechanical hyperventilation is an established treatment to reduce brain edema and intracranial pressure in patients with encephalopathia caused by acute liver failure. Hyperventilation and ensuing hypocarbia may also affect central and systemic circulation and thereby influence graft performance in patients following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).

   METHODS: We measured the effects of normocapnia and hypocapnia on systemic hemodynamics, gastric tonometry, as a marker of splanchnic oxygenation, and the indocyanine green kinetic, as a global marker of graft function, in humans post OLT.

   RESULTS: Hyperventilation was performed to a PaCO2 of 4.2 +/- 0.4 kPa (31 +/- 3.4 mm Hg) for about 1 h in 14 liver transplant recipients. Systemic hemodynamics as well as indices of splanchnic oxygenation and indocyanine green kinetics remained statistically unchanged.

   CONCLUSION: We did not observe any statistically significant circulatory effects or changes in indocyanine green kinetics in liver transplant recipients in the immediate OLT postoperative period caused by short-term mechanical hyperventilation.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Treatment of increased intracranial pressure often includes an active change in arterial and venous pressure, sometimes with draining of cerebrospinal fluid. We evaluated tissue and perfusion pressure during corresponding interventions in an organ enclosed in a rigid compartment with capillaries permeable for electrolytes and impaired autoregulation, conditions comparable to those present in the injured brain.

   METHOD: An isolated cat skeletal muscle enclosed in a closed fluid-filled plethysmograph served as a model for the injured brain surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid and the cranium. Tissue pressure and blood flow were measured during variation in arterial and venous pressures and in intraplethysmographic fluid volume. Autoregulation was depressed by papaverine.

   RESULTS: 1) Tissue pressure was not influenced by the venous pressure when this was below the tissue pressure, hereby generating venous collapse and a venous outflow resistance. When venous pressure was higher than the tissue pressure (no venous outflow resistance), these two parameters changed in parallel. 2) A change in arterial pressure induced a similar large change in tissue pressure at steady state, whereas blood flow remained unchanged. 3) Variation in tissue pressure induced by a change in the intraplethysmographic fluid volume was transient.

   CONCLUSIONS: If applicable to the injured brain, the results indicate that 1) a venous pressure change has a small influence on the intracranial pressure when a venous outflow resistance is present, 2) brain oedema can be reduced by lowering of the arterial inflow pressure, and blood flow will be maintained, 3) the decrease in intracranial pressure obtained by draining cerebrospinal fluid will be transient.

Abstract
  Recent publications have suggested that intra-ocular pressure (IOP) may be an indirect assessment of intra-cranial pressure (ICP). Both IOP and ICP have similar physiologic pressure ranges and similar responses to changes in intra-abdominal, intra-thoracic and aortic pressure. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationships between retinal arterial pressure and aortic pressure, intra-ocular pressure and retinal venous pressure, intra-cranial pressure and retinal venous pressure. Power athletes routinely utilize the Valsalva maneuver during weightlifting. In fact there are reports of stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, conjunctival, foveal and retinal hemorrhage, retinal detachment, hiatal hernia and pneumothorax associated with weightlifting. These events are thought to occur secondary to the extreme pressure elevations that occur in the intra-abdominal, intra-thoracic, intra-cranial, intra-ocular and vascular compartments. To date no human studies have examined the IOP changes that may occur with heavy resistance exercise. Therefore, we recruited power athletes (n = 11), who had participated in prior studies, from the local metropolitan area. The athletes had blood pressure status, drug screening and medical histories performed during previous investigations. Intra-ocular pressure was measured by noncontact tonometry at rest and during maximal isometric contraction. All subjects resting IOP were within normal ranges (mean 13 +/- 2.8 mmHg). Intra-ocular pressures were significantly (p < 0.0001) elevated in each subject during maximal contraction (mean 28 +/- 9.3 mmHg). One subject's IOP reached 46 mmHg during maximal contraction. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant linear relationship (r = 0.62, p < 0.0001) in the net change of IOP from rest to maximal contraction for each subject. This study demonstrates that IOP elevates to pathophysiologic levels during resistance exercise. The findings of conjunctival hemorrhages in two subjects further supports IOP being reflective of retinal venous pressure. The enormous pressures generated by power athletes during weightlifting leads to elevations in ICP which obstruct venous outflow leading to hemorrhage and elevations in IOP. The question remains as to whether these intermittent bursts of elevated IOP can lead to long-term pathological sequelae.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of gastric surgery-induced weight loss for the treatment of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC).

   SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Pseudotumor cerebri (also called idiopathic intracranial hypertension), a known complication of severe obesity, is associated with severe headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures, and normal brain imaging. The authors have found in previous clinical and animal studies that PTC in obese persons is probably secondary to a chronic increase in intraabdominal pressure leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. CSF-peritoneal shunts have a high failure rate, probably because they involve shunting from a high-pressure system to another high-pressure zone. In an earlier study of gastric bypass surgery in eight patients, CSF pressure decreased from 353+/-35 to 168+/-12 mm H2O at 34+/-8 months after surgery, with resolution of headaches in all.

   METHODS: Twenty-four severely obese women underwent bariatric surgery--23 gastric bypasses and one laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding--62+/-52 months ago for the control of severe obesity associated with PTC. CSF pressures were 324+/-83 mm H2O. Additional PTC central nervous system and cranial nerve problems included peripheral visual field loss, trigeminal neuralgia, recurrent Bell's palsy, and pulsatile tinnitus. Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea occurred in one patient, and hemiplegia with homonymous hemianopsia developed as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement in another. There were two occluded lumboperitoneal shunts and another functional but ineffective lumboperitoneal shunt. Additional obesity comorbidity in these patients included degenerative joint disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, urinary stress incontinence, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation, and type II diabetes mellitus.

   RESULTS: At 1 year after bariatric surgery, 19 patients lost an average of 45+/-12 kg, which was 71+/-18% of their excess weight. Their body mass index and percentage of ideal body weight had fallen to 30+/-5 kg/m2 and 133+/-22%, respectively. In four patients, less than 1 year had elapsed since surgery. Five patients were lost to follow-up. Surgically induced weight loss was associated with resolution of headache and pulsatile tinnitus in all but one patient within 4 months of the procedure. The cranial nerve dysfunctions resolved in all patients. The patient with CSF rhinorrhea had resolution within 4 weeks of gastric bypass. Of the 19 patients not lost to follow-up, 2 regained weight, with recurrence of headache and pulsatile tinnitus. Additional resolved associated comorbidities were 6/14 degenerative joint disease, 9/10 gastroesophageal reflux disorder, 2/6 hypertension, and all with sleep apnea, hypoventilation, type II diabetes mellitus, and urinary incontinence.

   CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is the long-term procedure of choice for severely obese patients with PTC and is shown to have a much higher rate of success than CSF-peritoneal shunting reported in the literature, as well as providing resolution of additional obesity comorbidity. Increased intraabdominal pressure associated with central obesity is the probable etiology of PTC, a condition that should no longer be considered idiopathic.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and reduces cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). We evaluated a nonsurgical means of reducing IAP to reverse this process.

   METHODS: Swine with a baseline ICP of 25 mm Hg produced by an intracranial balloon catheter were studied. In group 1 (n = 5), IAP was increased by 25 mm Hg. Continuous negative abdominal pressure (CNAP) was then applied. Group 2 (n = 4) had neither IAP elevation nor CNAP. Group 3 (n = 4) had CNAP without IAP elevation.

   RESULTS: Elevation of IAP by 25 mm Hg above baseline led to deleterious changes in ICP (25.8+/-0.8 to 39.0+/-2.8; p < 0.05) and CPP (85.2+/-2.0 to 64.8+/-2.6; p < 0.05). CNAP led to a reduction in IAP (30.2+/-1.2 to 20.4+/-1.3; p < 0.05) and improvements in cerebral perfusion (ICP, 33+/-2.7; CPP, 74.4+/-1.2; both p < 0.05). Group 2 had stable ICP (25.8+/-0.25 to 28.7+/-1.7; p > 0.05) and CPP (80.8+/-1.4 to 80.5+/-1.8; p > 0.05). In group 3, CNAP decreased cardiac index (2.9+/-0.2 to 1.1+/-0.4; p < 0.05), mean arterial pressure (105.2+/-4.0 to 38.2+/-12.0; p < 0.05), and CPP (74.2+/-4.7 to 14.5+/-12.2; p < 0.05).

   CONCLUSION: Elevations in IAP led to increased ICP and decreased CPP. CNAP ameliorated these intracranial disturbances. With normal IAP, CNAP impaired cerebral perfusion.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Dural sinus thrombosis can lead to intracranial venous hypertension and can be complicated by intracranial hemorrhage. We present a case report of a patient who underwent endovascular recanalization and stenting of a thrombosed occipital sinus.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old patient with a history of chronic sinus thrombosis refractory to anticoagulant therapy presented with acute onset of aphasia and hemiparesis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed hydrocephalus and cerebral edema. Angiography delineated multiple dural arteriovenous fistulae and persistent occlusion of the posterior sagittal, occipital, and bilateral transverse dural sinuses with retrograde cortical venous drainage.

   INTERVENTION: After embolization of the dural arteriovenous fistulae, a transvenous approach was used to recanalize and perform balloon angioplasty of the right internal jugular vein and the occipital and left transverse sinuses, resulting in subsequent clinical improvement. The patient's condition deteriorated 3 days later with reocclusion of both balloon-dilated sinuses. Repeat angioplasty and then deployment of an endovascular stent in the occipital sinus were performed, and reestablishment of venous outflow was achieved, resulting in a decrease of intracranial venous pressure from 41 to 14 mm Hg and neurological improvement. At the 3-month follow-up examination, the stented occipital sinus remained patent and served as the only conduit for extracranial venous outflow; the patient remained neurologically intact at the 12-month follow-up examination.

   CONCLUSION: This is the first report of mechanical recanalization, balloon angioplasty, and stent deployment in the occipital sinus to provide sustained venous outflow for the treatment of venous hypertension with retrograde cortical venous drainage in a patient with dural pansinus thrombosis refractory to anticoagulant therapy.

Abstract
  The development of papilledema requires high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure in the distal optic nerve sheath, elevation of the pressure in the central retinal vein, and impaired perfusion of the neurons as they traverse the lamina cribrosa. Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is a syndrome defined by four criteria: 1) Increased intracranial pressure, 2) normal or small ventricles on neuroimaging, 3) no evidence of an intracranial mass, and 4) normal CSF composition. Elevated intracranial venous pressure is thought by some authors to be the "universal mechanism" of PTC of varying etiologies. The reason obesity predisposes to idiopathic PTC is unclear, but one mechanism proposed is that central obesity raises intra-abdominal pressure, which increases pleural pressure and cardiac filling pressures, which impede venous return from the brain, leading to increased intracranial venous pressure and increased intracranial pressure. Both optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) and lumboperitoneal shunting (LPS) may improve vision and prevent deterioration of vision in patients with PTC. Both procedures have their advantages and disadvantages, but until a prospective, randomized study comparing ONSF with LPS for PTC is performed, the question of which surgical procedure is best for the treatment of PTC remains unanswered.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) on the control of nosocomial infection (NI) in critically ill pediatric patients.

   DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, non-blinded and controlled clinical microbiology study.

   SETTING: The pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary level pediatric university hospital. CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION: Patients 1 month to 14 years old, who underwent some kind of manipulation or instrumentation (mechanical ventilation, vascular cannulation, monitoring of intracranial pressure, thoracic or abdominal drainage, bladder catheterization, peritoneal dialysis, etc.) and/or presented a neurological coma requiring a stay in the PICU of 3 or more days.

   PATIENTS: Over a period of 2 years, 244 patients met the inclusion criteria; 18 patients were withdrawn because of protocol violation. The treatment group comprised 116 patients and the control group, 110 patients.

   INTERVENTION: The treatment group received a triple therapy of colimycin, tobramycin and nystatin administered orally or via nasogastric tube every 6 hours. All patients with mechanical ventilation or immune-depression received decontamination treatment of the oropharyngeal cavity with hexitidine (Oraldine 0.5 mg/ml) every 6-8 hours in accordance with the PICU's conventional protocol.

   METHOD: Up to 10 types of nosocomial infection were diagnosed following criteria of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The severity and manipulation of the patients on admission was assessed using the therapeutic intervention scoring system (TISS) and multi-organ system failure scores (MOSF).

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: UNIVARIANT ANALYSIS: SDD did not significantly reduce the incidence of NI, antibiotic use, the length of stay, or mortality; although a small percentage of respiratory and urinary tract infections was detected, catheter-related bacteremia was the most common infection. MULTIVARIANT ANALYSIS: Controlling the risk factors for each child through log regression showed that SDD acted as a protective factor for more than 90% of the sample with respect to the appearance of respiratory and urinary tract infections, reducing the risk of such infections to 1/5 and 1/3, respectively.

   CONCLUSIONS: SDD was effective in controlling respiratory and urinary tract infections in children admitted to the PICU, but it did not reduce the incidence of other types of nosocomial infection.

Abstract
  A 7-year-old-boy (Case 1) and a 60-year-old-man (Case 2) presented with rare spontaneous resolution of acute subdural hematoma (ASDH). They were admitted with consciousness disturbance, drowsy in Case 1 and sleepy in Case 2. Initial CT showed ASDH associated with a low density band between the hematoma and the inner wall of the skull base, combined with right parietal contusion in Case 2. Repeat CT showed that the hematoma had resolved spontaneously after a few hours, and the patients regained clear consciousness next day in Case 1 within a few days in Case 2 without surgical treatment. The mechanism of spontaneous resolution of ASDH was thought to involve pulsatile flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the tear in the arachnoid membrane, resulting in redistribution and dispersal of the hematoma, and retrograde flow into the subarachnoid space. The characteristic feature of the CT findings, the low density band between the hematoma and the inner wall of the skull bone, probably shows this process. Spontaneous resolution of ASDH requires that the brain compensatory function maintains the normal outflow of CSF, and controls the intracranial pressure by CSF buffering, blood outflow via the venous system, and brain elasticity. The low density band may be a useful finding to distinguish cases with good and bad prognosis.

Abstract
  Laboratory studies suggest the pulsatile component of the transcranial doppler (TCD) waveform may be useful in determining lower autoregulatory threshold. This study aimed to assess the effect of increasing CPP on jugular bulb oximetry (SjO2) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) TCD flow velocities in the early management of severe head injury. 16 severely head injured patients (GCS < or = 8), had intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure, SjO2 and MCA Doppler velocity monitored continuously. CPP was increased by intravenous fluids (right atrial pressure approximately equal to 10) and supplemented with adrenaline infusion until TCD pulsatility (Gosling pulsatility index [PI] reached a plateau. The mean CPP at which SjO2 surpassed 55% was 62 +/- 6.2 mm Hg. TCD PI did not plateau until a significantly higher mean CPP of 74 +/- 5.1 mm Hg was achieved (p < 0.01). In 8 cases, increased CPP was associated with a fall in ICP, ranging from 1 to 8 mm Hg. We conclude that a critically low level of SjO2 is a late indicator of failed autoregulation. CPP values associated with intact autoregulation identified by TCD assessment of MCA flow are significantly higher than those indicated by SjO2 monitoring. MCA Doppler flow assessment may be useful in determining the level of CPP at which therapy should be aimed in the early resuscitation of head trauma.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: A retrospective study was carried out on 13 patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) who presented with isolated or associated signs of intracranial hypertension.

   METHODS: Nine patients presented with symptoms of intracranial hypertension at the time of diagnosis. Ocular fundoscopy available in 12 patients showed bilateral papilloedema in eight and optic disk atrophy in four. Clinical evolution was particularly noticeable in five patients because of chronic (two patients) or acute (after lumbar shunting or puncture: three patients, one death) tonsillar herniation.

   RESULTS: Two patients had a type I fistula (drainage into a sinus, with a normal antegrade flow direction). The remaining 11 had type II fistulas (drainage into a sinus, with abnormal retrograde venous drainage into sinuses or cortical veins). Stenosis or thrombosis of the sinus(es) distal to the fistula was present in five patients. The cerebral venous drainage was abnormal in all patients.

   CONCLUSION: Type II (and some type I) DAVFs may present as isolated intracranial hypertension mimicking benign intracranial hypertension. Normal cerebral angiography should be added as a fifth criterion of benign intracranial hypertension. The cerebral venous drainage pattern must be carefully studied by contralateral carotid and vertebral artery injections to correctly evaluate the impairment of the cerebral venous outflow. Lumbar CSF diversion (puncture or shunting) may induce acute tonsillar herniation and should be avoided absolutely. DAVF may induce intracranial hypertension, which has a poor long term prognosis and may lead to an important loss of visual acuity and chronic tonsillar herniation. Consequently, patients with intracranial hypertension must be treated, even aggressively, to obliterate the fistula or at least to reduce the arterial flow and to restore a normal cerebral venous drainage. The endovascular treatment may associate arterial or transvenous embolisation and/or surgery. Patients in whom the fistula is not obliterated after an endovascular therapeutic procedure, need continuous clinical and angiographical follow up.

Abstract
  We studied transmission of arterial blood pressure to intracranial pressure by observing how the two pressure waveforms varied from baseline conditions to after postural change or jugular compression. Such experiments may lead to pressure waveform-based estimates of intracranial compliance. Using a single database of arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, and intracranial pressure waveforms collected during baseline, jugular compresison, and head-elevated conditions from six Yucatan minipigs, we computed several numerical indicators of waveform shape to find an estimator of intracranial compliance. Of these indicators, two were based on the Fourier-decomposition of all three waveforms, and one was based on a new method for approximating the systolic slope of the intracranial pressure waveform. We computed amplitude transfer functions for the first six harmonics of the Fourier spectrum, treating intracranial pressure as system output and independently treating arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure as system inputs. Using these same inputs and outputs, we computed a single quotient based on the Fourier coefficients of the first six harmonics of the input and output waveforms. Finally, applying a Gaussian high-pass filter, we computed systolic slope approximations for all intracranial pressure wave cycles contained in a single respiratory cycle. Our third indicator was the mean-normalized variation of the slope approximations over a respiratory cycle. We studied how each composite at baseline varied with baseline mean intracranial pressure and how each composite changed from baseline as a result of a physical manipulation. Our analysis suggests that the composite based on respiratory variation of systolic slope approximations was positively correlated with mean intracranial pressure during baseline. The quotient based on Fourier coefficients with arterial blood pressure input seemed to increase from baseline to jugular compression. Composites that treated central venous pressure as input were both less correlated with mean intracranial pressure during baseline and exhibited less predictable changes from baseline to a physical manipulation than their counterparts that used arterial blood pressure as input. However, none of these apparent trends was statistically significant. The lack of statistically significant results may be due to the nature of the composites and/or the small sample size (n = 6). However, we hope this study stimulates further investigation of both central venous pressure-to-intracranial pressure (in addition to arterial blood pressure-to-intracranial pressure) transfer and automated computation of intracranial pressure waveform systolic slope. Such research may lead to noninvasively determined estimators of intracranial compliance.

Abstract
  Extradural drainage systems connected to a vacuum device for preventing postoperative haematoma formation are often used in neurosurgical practice. Cardiovascular complications, including bradycardia or low arterial pressure caused by intracranial hypotension, have been described associated with their use. We have investigated the relationship between the negative pressure applied to extradural drainage systems and intracranial pressure (ICP), and analysed the effects of negative pressure of the drains on systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean (MAP) arterial pressures and on heart rate (HR). We studied prospectively 15 patients undergoing neurosurgery for supratentorial tumours or aneurysms. Transient decreases in ICP (P < 0.001) and HR (P < 0.001), with no clinical effects, were observed after connecting the vacuum device to the drain. There were no significant changes in SAP, DAP or MAP.

Abstract
  OBJECT: Intrathecal bolus administration of (Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)aminio]diazen++ +-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA/NO), a long half-life diazeniumdiolate-class nitric oxide (NO) donor, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in the treatment of delayed cerebral vasospasm in a canine model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

   METHODS: The baseline basilar artery (BA) diameter of 25 dogs was measured with the aid of angiography on Day 0. Vasospasm was then induced by intracisternal injection of autologous arterial blood on Days 0 and 2. Repeated arteriography on Day 7 revealed an average BA diameter of 58% of baseline. Each dog was then randomized to one of four groups: a pathology control group (SAH only, four animals); a treatment control group (SAH plus 2 micromol of the inactive drug carrier DETA, eight animals); a low-dose treatment group (SAH plus 0.2 micromol DETA/NO, six animals); or a high-dose treatment group (SAH plus 2 micromol DETA/NO, six animals). The drugs were administered in a 2-ml intrathecal bolus via the cisterna magna. Arterial caliber was monitored by angiography over the subsequent 4 hours. A 2-micromol dose of the drug was then given and serial arteriography continued for an additional hour to screen for tachyphylaxis. Intracranial pressure and respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored. Histopathological analyses of the animals' brains were performed after the dogs were killed on Day 8. The drug DETA/NO produced reversal of vasospasm in a dose-dependent fashion that roughly followed a double exponential time course. Doses of 2 micromol DETA/NO resulted in restoration of the angiographically monitored BA diameter to the prevasospasm size at 1.5 hours posttreatment, and this was sustained at 88% of baseline at 4 hours (p < 0.01, independent samples t-test). By contrast, the treatment control group remained on average at 54% of baseline diameter. The low-dose treatment group achieved only partial and more transitory relaxation. Histopathological analyses showed findings consistent with chronic SAH but did not demonstrate any toxicity associated with the NO donor. No adverse physiological changes were seen.

   CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that long-acting NO donors are potentially useful as agents to restore circulation in patients suffering from cerebral vasospasm.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of intravenous bolus administration of 23.4% saline (8008 mOsm/L) on refractory intracranial hypertension (RIH) in patients with diverse intracranial diseases.

   DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.

   SETTING: A neurosciences intensive care unit in a university hospital.

   PATIENTS: We present eight patients and a total of 20 episodes of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) resistant to standard modes of therapy. Five patients had subarachnoid hemorrhage, one patient had traumatic brain injury, one had a brain tumor, and another had spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage. Seven patients had intraventricular catheters, and one had a subarachnoid pressure screw placed. We monitored continuously mean ICP, serum sodium concentrations, mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), central venous pressure, and urine output before and after the administration of hypertonic saline (HS). Post mortem examination of the brain was performed in two patients.

   INTERVENTION: Intravenous bolus administration of 30 mL of 23.4% saline.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was a significant (p < .05) decrease in ICP from a median of 41.5 mm Hg before HS to 17 mm Hg at 1 hr, 16 mm Hg at 2 hrs, and 14 mm Hg at 3 hrs after HS administration. In 80% of cases, ICP decreased by >50% of the pretreatment value over a duration of 21.2+/-10.3 mins. ICP decreased to <20 mm Hg in 65% of all cases and the mean time for it to again exceed 20 mm Hg was 6.3+/-4.9 hrs. There was a significant improvement in CPP, from 64.7+/-19 (SD) mm Hg before HS to 85.6+/-18 mm Hg (1 hr) and 83+/-18 mm Hg (3 hrs) after HS. There were no significant differences in the other variables measured. The post mortem examinations showed no white matter changes or subdural collections.

   CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary case series suggests that the intravenous bolus administration of 23.4% saline reduces ICP and augments CPP in patients with resistant increased ICP. This reduction can be maintained for several hours while other therapeutic measures are being considered. The patient population most likely to respond to this therapy needs to be further defined. Although more research is needed, this treatment is promising as a new modality for RIH because of its ICP-lowering effect without intravascular volume depletion.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Massive usage of new neuroimaging techniques has produced an increase in the number of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis. Our aim has been to evaluate this shift in our county through the clinico-radiologic characteristics of the patients admitted to our unit.

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over the last 7 years a total of 12 patients suffering from cerebral venous thrombosis were attended in our department. We have analyzed retrospectively their clinical records.

   RESULTS: There were 11 women 1 man with a range of ages from 13 to 60 years old. The main associated factor was oral contraceptives intake. Most of them presented with symptoms of benign intracranial hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging was the most sensitive diagnostic tool. Outcome was good in general. Most of them were treated with intravenous heparin during the acute phase and received oral anticoagulation for 6 months. More than half were diagnosed all over the last three years.

   CONCLUSIONS: Our data seem to confirm this tendency towards a larger number of cases with the application of new diagnostic tools. In these cases, clinical course is more benign than reported in classical series.

Abstract
  It is well established that cerebral blood flow (CBF) is sensitive to variations in arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) and can be influenced by changes in jugular venous return due to elevated intrathoracic pressure. Therefore, we compared cerebral CO2 vasoreactivity when PaCO2 was altered either by changing inspired PCO2 or tidal volume. In addition, we sought to determine if noninvasive transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can be used instead of invasive CBF measurement to determine cerebral CO2 vasoreactivity. In 36 mechanically ventilated patients in coma due to acute brain lesion, we evaluated CBF by continuous jugular thermodilution, middle cerebral artery flow velocity (Vm) by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, intracranial pressure (ICP; in only 23 of them) by intraventricular catheter, systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic variables, and arterial and jugular bulb blood gases. Measurements were taken at four levels of PaCO2 (25, 30, 35, and 40 mmHg) by modifying in a random order either tidal volume or inspired PCO2. Cerebral, pulmonary, and systemic hemodynamic changes were similar in magnitude during both methods of altering PaCO2. From the highest to the lowest PaCO2, CBF decreased from 61+/-7 to 36+/-4 ml/min/100 g (p < 0.001, mean +/- SE), Vm from 89+/-7 to 65+/-5 cm/s (p < 0.001), and ICP from 29+/-2 to 12+/-2 mmHg (p < 0.001), but cerebral perfusion pressure remained constant, ranging from 65+/-3 to 67+/-4 mmHg (p = NS). Arteriojugular oxygen content difference increased from 3.2+/-0.2 to 5.7+/-0.4 ml/dl (p < 0.001). Eleven of the 20 patients with a preserved CBF response to CO2 survived to 6 months, whereas only two of the 16 patients with an altered response were alive at 6 months (p < 0.05). When compared with CBF by jugular thermodilution, the rates of sensitivity and specificity of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to detect impaired cerebral CO2 vasoreactivity were 69% and 65%, respectively. In conclusion, the reduction of PaCO2 from 40 to 25 mmHg by modifying either tidal volume or inspired PCO2 resulted in similar effects on cerebral, pulmonary, and systemic circulations. Cerebral CO2 vasoreactivity is of prognostic value in brain-injured patients when determined using CBF but may be misleading when evaluated using velocities measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented an increase in intracranial pressure with abdominal insufflation, but the mechanism has not been explained.

   METHODS: Nine 30-35-kg domestic pigs underwent carbon dioxide insufflation at 1.5 l/min. Intracranial pressure (ICP), lumbar spinal pressure (LP), central venous pressure (CVP), inferior vena cava pressure (IVCP), heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and end-tidal CO2 were continuously measured. Mechanical ventilation was used to maintain a constant pCO2. Measurements were recorded at 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg of abdominal pressure with animals in supine, Trendelenburg (T), and reverse Trendelenburg (RT) positions. Prior to recording measurements, the animals were allowed to stabilize for 40 min after each increase in abdominal pressure and for 20 min after each position change.

   RESULTS: The animals showed a significant increase in ICP (mmHg) with each 5-mmHg increase in abdominal pressure (0 mmHg: 14 +/- 1.7; 5 mmHg: 19.8 +/- 2.3, p < 0.001; 10 mmHg: 24.8 +/- 2.5, p < 0.001; 15 mmHg: 29.8 +/- 4.7, p < 0.01). The ICP at 15 mmHg abdominal pressure increased further in the T position (39 +/- 4, p < 0.01). Insufflating in the RT position did not significantly reduce the increase in ICP. The IVCP (mmHg) increased with increased abdominal pressure (0 mmHg: 11.5 +/- 6.2, 15 mmHg: 22.1 +/- 3.5, p < 0.01). This increase correlated with the increase in ICP and LP (r of mean pressures >/=0.95). There was no significant change in CVP.

   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that care may be needed with laparoscopy in patients at risk for increased ICP due to head injury or a space occupying lesion. The mechanism of increased ICP associated with insufflation is most likely impaired venous drainage of the lumbar venous plexus at increased intraabdominal pressure. Further studies of cerebral spinal fluid movement during insufflation are currently underway to confirm this hypothesis.

Abstract
  OBJECT: The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of direct packing of the isolated sinus (occluded both distally and proximally) in patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) of the transverse-sigmoid sinus.

   METHODS: Eight patients were included in this study. There were seven men and one woman, ranging in age from 47 to 75 years (mean 60.4 years). Five patients presented with intracranial hemorrhage or venous infarction, one with convulsions, and two with pulsatile tinnitus. Prominent retrograde cortical venous drainage due to sinus isolation was angiographically demonstrated in all patients. All patients were treated by a small craniotomy and direct sinus packing with microcoils; the procedure was performed with the aid of digital subtraction angiography. Five patients were pretreated with transarterial embolization to reduce arterial inflow before the procedure, and intrasinus pressure and sinus blood gases were monitored throughout the operation. Postsurgery, the dural AVF was completely obliterated in all patients. The sinus pressure was 29 to 58% of systemic blood pressure, and sinus blood gas levels were purely arterial before packing. There was no morbidity related to direct sinus packing; however, one patient died as a result of acute myocardial infarction. Over a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 5 years, a faint asymptomatic dural AVF recurred in one patient on the cortex adjacent to the occluded sinus but regressed spontaneously within 1 year.

   CONCLUSIONS: Direct sinus packing was found to be highly effective for the treatment of dural AVFs that empty into the isolated sinus. Measurement of changes in sinus pressure and sinus blood gas levels was useful for monitoring the progress of direct sinus packing.

Abstract
  Cerebrovascular disorders are frequently associated with sickle cell disease, mainly in homozygous children. We report the case a 25-old-patient with known sickle cell disease who presented with coma inaugurated by manifestations of intracranial hypertension. CT revealed bilateral thalamic infarcts and angiography confirmed the thrombosis of internal cerebral veins. Treatment included heparin and blood transfusion. Severe cerebral oedema resulted in the lethal outcome three days later.

Abstract
  Twenty cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) are reported. A significant majority of patients were young women receiving oral contraceptives. In the puerperium CVT were frequent and delayed; the number of septic lateral sinus thrombosis was the same as in the occidental countries. The clinical picture was not specific, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri were not frequent. Focal signs were the most frequent clinical manifestations. The clinical course, of deep CVT was not as severe as previously reported. Due to the lack of MRI, only CT scan was performed for all patients. More than 50% showed direct signs of CVT (cord sign and delta sign). The diagnosis of CVT was confirmed by cerebral angiography. Early systematic treatment by heparin was used with neither appearance nor aggravation of hemorrhagic infarcts being observed. The outcome was favorable in 60% of the cases, except for venous hemorrhagic infarction.

Abstract
  A rare case of complex cerebral arteriovenous fistula in an infant is reported. An 8-month-old boy first presented with a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure. Neuroradiological assessment showed a direct intracerebral arteriovenous shunt with marked venous engorgement. No hemorrhage was evident. Direct surgical treatment was decided. Clinical and radioanatomical cure was achieved. The main angiographic and pathophysiologic features of this unusual entity, as well as the available therapeutic options, are reviewed and discussed.

Abstract
  Incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear. Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is characterized as an acute, protein-rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure. NPE is infrequently diagnosed, usually in association with head trauma. Pathophysiological mechanisms include a rise of the pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure either due to sympathetic innervation with pulmonary vasoconstriction or increased left-atrial pressure following systemic arterial hypertension or an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability. In contrast to NPE, cardiac complications are frequently observed, most consistently in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Typical ECG changes are repolarization abnormalities, similar to those observed in coronary heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. The CK-MB may be slightly elevated; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left-ventricular function. Pathological examination reveals myofibrillar necrosis. Cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines. For adequate treatment, close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions. [References: 65]

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Pharmacological cerebral vasoconstriction has recently been suggested as treatment for patients with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) after severe traumatic brain lesions. Hypothetically, a moderate constriction of precapillary resistance vessels might be advantageous since it decreases intracapillary blood pressure, and a contraction of cerebral veins might effectively reduce intracranial blood volume and ICP. This report examines the in vitro effects of two vasoconstrictors, dihydroergotamine (DHE) and sumatriptan, which may be considered for treatment of increased ICP.

   METHODS: The reactivity of isolated small human cerebral subcutaneous and omental arteries and veins were studied during exposure to different concentrations of DHE and sumatriptan.

   RESULTS: Both sumatriptan and DHE induced concentration-dependent contractions in human cerebral arteries and veins and 50% of maximum contractions were obtained at significantly lower concentrations of DHE than of sumatriptan. The maximum contraction of cerebral arteries was significantly higher with sumatriptan than with DHE. Both drugs caused contractions of subcutaneous arteries at concentrations of 10(-7)-10(-6)M, which is within the therapeutic concentration range of sumatriptan, while no effect was obtained in omental vessels.

   CONCLUSIONS: Both DHE and sumatriptan cause contraction of isolated human cortical arteries and veins at very low concentrations. The differences observed between the two drugs may be explained by the fact that DHE is an alpha-adrenergic as well as a 5-HT agonist while sumatriptan acts specifically on 5-HT receptors. The study supports the hypothesis underlying the use of DHE for the treatment of increased ICP in patients with severe traumatic brain lesions.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Radical resection of meningiomas and dural arteriovenous fistulas involving functional major dural sinuses entails the risk of intracranial hypertension and venous infarction. Surgical reconstruction of dural sinuses and bridging veins increases the spectrum of dural sinus conditions that can be treated by complete resection, but indications for venous reconstructions and associated risks are still not well defined. We report our experience with sinus reconstruction based on the intraoperative assessment of collateral venous flow.

   METHODS: Radical resection of meningiomas (n = 5) or dural arteriovenous fistulas (n = 5) involving critical segments of dural sinuses was performed in 10 patients. All but two patients were suffering from recurrent disease after incomplete treatment. Tolerance of sinus occlusion was assessed intraoperatively by measuring stump pressure in the superior sagittal sinus during test clamping of the involved sinus segment.

   RESULTS: In five patients, the results of pressure monitoring suggested that occlusion of the sinus might not be tolerated. In two other patients, major bridging veins entered the diseased segment. In these patients, the resected sinus segment was reconstructed and bridging veins were reinserted as far as possible. Postoperative graft occlusion occurred in two patients. One patient who was managed without reconstruction sustained a transient postoperative neurological deficit resulting from venous congestion in the vein of Labbe. Postoperative imaging confirmed total elimination of the pathological process in all 10 patients. There was no recurrence of disease during follow-up periods of up to 8 years.

   CONCLUSION: The monitoring of sinus pressure, together with the possible reconstruction of the diseased sinus, allows complete surgical treatment of dural sinus abnormalities and involves acceptable risk.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Thrombosis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) with associated elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a rare complication of central venous catheterization but has not been reported as a result of blunt trauma.

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old male patient was observed to be obtunded after an assault. The initial examination was remarkable for somnolence, bruising of the anterior neck, and diffuse, edematous swelling of the face and scalp. The results of computed tomography of the brain were normal. An angiogram obtained on the 2nd hospital day to rule out carotid injury revealed bilateral IJV thromboses to the cranial base. An ICP monitor was placed with an opening pressure of 33 mm Hg. The central venous pressure was measured to be 9 mm Hg. A catheter was passed through the left IJV thrombus and into the sigmoid sinus, where the pressure was 17 mm Hg.

   INTERVENTION: An intravascular stent was deployed in the left IJV. ICP rapidly normalized. A regimen of coumadin was administered to the patient for 6 weeks, at which time the stent remained patent.

   CONCLUSION: We conclude that traumatic jugular vein thrombosis can be associated with significant elevation in ICP and that treatment with an endovascular stent can affect the rapid correction of intracranial hypertension in patients who are candidates for anticoagulation. [References: 24]

Abstract
  We treated a neonate in intractable cardiac failure due to a vein of Galen malformation. She manifested severe multiple organ failure. Perioperative problems are cardiac failure, respiratory failure, renal as well as hepatic dysfunction, and coagulopathy. Direct clipping of the feeding arteries improved her symptoms. Anesthetic problems encountered in this patient are massive bleeding and drastic circulatory changes while clipping the feeding arteries, increased intracranial pressure and brain ischemia, and other underlying complications; hepatic and renal dysfunction, respiratory failure and coagulopathy.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To study cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption in severe head-injured children and also to assess the effect of hyperventilation on regional cerebral blood flow.

   DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.

   SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit at a tertiary-level university children's hospital.

   PATIENTS: Twenty-three children with isolated severe brain injury, whose admission Glasgow Coma Scores were <8.

   INTERVENTIONS: PaCO2 was adjusted by altering minute ventilation. Cerebral metabolic measurements were made at three levels of PaCO2 (>35, 25 to 35, and <25 torr [>4.7, 3.3 to 4.7, and <3.3 kPa]) after allowing 15 mins for equilibrium.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies (each study consisting of three sets of measurements at different levels of PaCO2) were performed on 23 patients. At each level of PaCO2, the following measurements were made: xenon-enhanced computed tomography scans; cerebral blood flow; intracranial pressure; jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation; mean arterial pressure; and arterial oxygen saturation. Derived variables included: cerebral oxygen consumption; cerebral perfusion pressure; and oxygen extraction ratio. Cerebral blood flow decreased below normal after head injury (mean 49.6 +/- 14.6 mL/min/100 g). Cerebral oxygen consumption decreased out of proportion to the decrease in cerebral blood flow; cerebral oxygen consumption was only a third of the normal range (mean 1.02 +/- 0.59 mL/min/100 g). Neither cerebral blood flow nor cerebral oxygen consumption showed any relationship to time after injury, Glasgow Coma Score at the time of presentation, or intracranial pressure. The frequency of one or more regions of ischemia (defined as cerebral blood flow of <18 mL/min/100 g) was 28.9% during normocapnia. This value increased to 73.1% for PaCO2 at <25 torr.

   CONCLUSIONS: Severe head injury in children produced a modest decrease in cerebral blood flow but a much larger decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption. Absolute hyperemia was uncommon at any time, but measured cerebral blood flow rates were still above the metabolic requirements of most children. The clear relationship between the frequency of cerebral ischemia and hypocarbia, combined with the rarity of hyperemia, suggests that hyperventilation should be used with caution and monitored carefully in children with severe head injuries.

Abstract
  We recently encountered a patient with thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus of an idiopathic cause. The patient was treated initially with combined local thrombolytic therapy through the burr hole over the superior sagittal sinus and systemic anticoagulant therapy. Continuous ventricular drainage and hyperbaric oxygenation therapy were used to control the increased intracranial pressure. The superior sagittal sinus was successfully recanalized. Whereas the patient suffered a complication with subacute subdural haematoma, he was successfully treated with the combination of these therapies. The rationale and approach are discussed.

Abstract
  The extent and timing of posttraumatic cerebral hemodynamic disturbances have significant implications for the monitoring and treatment of patients with head injury. This prospective study of cerebral blood flow (CBF) (measured using 133Xe clearance) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements in 125 patients with severe head trauma has defined three distinct hemodynamic phases during the first 2 weeks after injury. The phases are further characterized by measurements of cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO[2]) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO[2]). Phase I (hypoperfusion phase) occurs on the day of injury (Day 0) and is defined by a low CBF calculated from cerebral clearance curves integrated to 15 minutes (mean CBF 32.3 +/- 2 ml/100 g/minute), normal middle cerebral artery (MCA) velocity (mean V[MCA] 56.7 +/- 2.9 cm/second), normal hemispheric index ([HI], mean HI 1.67 +/- 0.11), and normal AVDO(2) (mean AVDO[2] 5.4 +/- 0.5 vol%). The CMRO, is approximately 50% of normal (mean CMRO(2) 1.77 +/- 0.18 ml/100 g/minute) during this phase and remains depressed during the second and third phases. In Phase II (hyperemia phase, Days 1-3), CBF increases (46.8 +/- 3 ml/100 g/minute), AVDO(2) falls (3.8 +/- 0.1 vol%), V(MCA) rises (86 +/- 3.7 cm/second), and the HI remains less than 3 (2.41 +/- 0.1). In Phase III (vasospasm phase, Days 4-15), there is a fall in CBF (35.7 +/- 3.8 ml/100 g/minute), a further increase in V(MCA) (96.7 +/- 6.3 cm/second), and a pronounced rise in the HI (2.87 +/- 0.22). This is the first study in which CBF, metabolic, and TCD measurements are combined to define the characteristics and time courses of, and to suggest etiological factors for, the distinct cerebral hemodynamic phases that occur after severe craniocerebral trauma. This research is consistent with and builds on the findings of previous investigations and may provide a useful temporal framework for the organization of existing knowledge regarding posttraumatic cerebrovascular and metabolic pathophysiology.

Abstract
  Jugular bulb oxygen monitoring can be used to estimate the adequacy of cerebral blood flow to support cerebral metabolism after severe head injury. In the present study, the authors studied the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO[2]) before and after treatment in 32 head-injured patients (Glasgow Coma Scale scores < or = 8) to examine the relationships among AVDO and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), delayed cerebral infarction, and outcome. Fifteen patients (Group A) underwent craniotomy for hematoma evacuation and 17 (Group B) received mannitol for sustained intracranial hypertension (intracranial pressure > 20 mm Hg, > 10 minutes). Radiographic evidence of delayed cerebral infarction was observed in 14 patients. Overall, 17 patients died or were severely disabled. Cerebral AVDO(2) was elevated before craniotomy or mannitol administration; the mean AVDO(2) for all patients before treatment was 8.6 +/- 1.8 vol%. Following craniotomy or mannitol administration, the AVDO(2) decreased in 27 patients and increased in five patients (mean AVDO(2) 6.2 +/- 2.1 vol% in all patients; 6 +/- 1.9 vol% in Group A; and 6.4 +/- 2.4 vol% in Group B). The mean CPP was 75 +/- 9.8 mm Hg and no relationship with AVDO(2) was demonstrated. Before treatment, the AVDO(2) was not associated with delayed cerebral infarction or outcome. By contrast, a limited improvement in elevated AVDO(2) after craniotomy or mannitol administration was significantly associated with delayed cerebral infarction (Group A: p < 0.001; Group B: p < 0.01). Similarly, a limited improvement in elevated AVDO(2) after treatment was significantly associated with an unfavorable outcome (Group A: p < 0.01; Group B: p < 0.001). In conclusion, these findings strongly indicate that, despite adequate cerebral perfusion, limited improvement in elevated cerebral AVDO(2) after treatment consisting of either craniotomy or mannitol administration may be used to help predict delayed cerebral infarction and poor outcome after traumatic brain injury.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: We monitored changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) in 2 children with myelodysplasia undergoing laparoscopic bladder autoaugmentation. Both children had ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS) secondary to Arnold-Chiari malformations (type II).

   METHODS: ICP was monitored through a 23-gauge needle placed into the shunt reservoir and connected to a pressure transducer and drainage system. Intraoperative mean arterial pressure, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), ICP, abdominal pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressures were all monitored.

   RESULTS: Both children demonstrated rapid onset and sustained increases in ICP of greater than 12 mm Hg above baseline to a maximum pressure of 25 mm Hg. The average cerebrospinal fluid removed from each patient was 30 cc, thereby lowering ICP with no adverse neurologic sequela. The pCO2 remained constant throughout the procedures, as measured by ETCO2.

   CONCLUSIONS: We believe that intracranial hypertension (IH) results from a "Valsalva-like" phenomenon, which causes cerebral vascular engorgement. In addition, the pneumoperitoneum may increase the resistance to outflow through the distal peritoneal catheter, causing a partial or complete shunt obstruction. Untreated IH may result in adverse neurologic sequelae from brain herniation in these children with hindbrain anomalies and potentially altered brain compliance. We believe it is prudent to perform intraoperative ICP monitoring in this subgroup of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery and that IH should be treated by ventricular drainage.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of acutely increased intra-abdominal pressure on pleural pressure, intracranial pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure, and to clarify the relationship between these parameters.

   DESIGN: Nonrandomized, controlled study.

   SETTING: Laboratory at a university medical center.

   SUBJECTS: Yorkshire swine, weighing 15 to 20 kg.

   INTERVENTIONS: Anesthetized, ventilated swine had a balloon inserted into the peritoneal cavity and catheters placed for measurement of intracranial pressure, pleural pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and mean arterial pressure. Following baseline measurements, intra-abdominal pressure was increased by incrementally inflating the intraperitoneal balloon. All parameters were remeasured 30 mins after each increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Two groups were studied: a) group 1 (n = 9) animals had intra-abdominal pressure increased to 25 mm Hg above baseline, then released; b) group 2 (n = 3) animals underwent sternotomy and pleuropericardotomy to prevent an increase in pleural pressure with increasing intra-abdominal pressure.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Increase of intra-abdominal pressure to 25 mm Hg above baseline caused significant (p < .05) increases in intracranial pressure (7.3 +/- 0.6 [SEM] to 16.4 +/- 1.9 mm Hg), pleural pressure (4.3 +/- 1.3 to 11.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (9.0 +/- 0.6 to 14.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg), and central venous pressure (6.6 +/- 0.7 to 10.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg). The cardiac index (3.4 +/- 0.3 to 1.6 +/- 0.1 L/min/m2) and cerebral perfusion pressure (75.6 +/- 3.6 to 62.0 +/- 6.8 mm Hg) deceased significantly (p < .05), whereas mean arterial pressure (82.8 +/- 3.2 to 78.4 +/- 6.6 mm Hg) remained essentially constant. Sternotomy and pleuro-pericardotomy negated all effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure except the decreased cardiac index (1.6 +/- 0.1 to 2.5 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2).

   CONCLUSIONS: Acutely increased intra-abdominal pressure causes a significant increase in intracranial pressure and a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. Increased intra-abdominal pressure appears to produce this effect by augmenting pleural and other intrathoracic pressures and causing a functional obstruction to cerebral venous outflow via the jugular venous system. It is possible that the same phenomenon may be why persons with chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as the morbidly obese, suffer from a high frequency rate of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Abstract
  The authors describe the clinical and radiological findings in a case of non-syndromic craniosynostosis affecting multiple sutures, in which the intracranial venous drainage was grossly anomalous. Investigation by magnetic resonance imaging and angiography revealed that almost all of the intracranial venous blood was draining from the dural sinuses transosseoussly via enlarged emissary veins to the external jugular veins and the vertebral veins. Although present, both internal jugular veins were small. This discovery represented a contraindication for the vault expansion surgery that had been recommended as treatment for the patient's raised intracranial pressure, and it has important implications for the management of all types of craniosynostosis.

Abstract
  Although the administration of alfentanil is routine in neurosurgical anaesthesia, the effects of the drug on cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) or intracranial pressure (ICP) have been a subject of controversy in the past. Therefore the effects of alfentanil (3 micrograms kg-1) on mean lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) in human volunteers without cerebral disease is reported here. The CSFP increased from 9 mmHg (P < 0.05) after intravenous (i.v.) injection of alfentanil, to 12 mmHg whereas MAP, CVP, HR and ETCO2 remained stable throughout the investigative period. The results from this study suggest that alfentanil, even when administered in low doses, leads to a relatively small but statistically significant increase in CSFP in humans with uncompromised intracranial compliance.

Abstract
  Hemodilution has been shown to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and reduce lesion volume in models of occlusive cerebral ischemia, but it has not been evaluated in the setting of head trauma and shock in which ischemia is thought to play a role in the evolution of secondary injury. In a porcine model of brain injury and shock the authors compared hemodilution with diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin (DCLHb) to a standard resuscitation regimen using Ringer's lactate solution and shed blood. After creation of a cryogenic brain injury followed by hemorrhage, the animals received a bolus of either 4 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate solution (Group 1, six animals) or DCLHb (Group 2, six animals), followed by infusion of Ringer's lactate solution to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP) to baseline. Group 1 received shed blood 1 hour after hemorrhage (R1) in the form of packed red blood cells. Group 2 received shed blood only for an Hb count of less than 5 g/dl. The animals were monitored for 24 hours. At R1, Group 2 had a significantly greater cerebral perfusion pressure ([CPP] 88 +/- 5.7 vs. 68 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, p < 0.05). By 3 hours after hemorrhage (R3) Group 2 had a significantly lower Hb concentration (8.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 12.1 +/- 0.3 g/dl, p < 0.05) and a significantly lower intracranial pressure ([ICP] 9 +/- 0.8 vs. 14 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, p < 0.05). The total 24-hour fluid requirement was significantly less in Group 2 (10,654 +/- 505 ml vs. 15,542 +/- 1094 ml, p < 0.05) There was no difference between the groups regarding levels of regional CBF in the injured hemisphere. Cerebral O2 delivery was not significantly different between groups at any time. Lesion volume as determined at postmortem examination was not significantly different between the groups. The increased MAP and CPP and lower ICP observed in the Group 2 animals indicate that hemodilution with DCLHb may be beneficial in the treatment of head injury and shock.

Abstract
  Intracranial hypertension is not a definitive diagnosis, but rather a syndrome that may result from a number of neurologic and systemic disorders. Intracranial hypertension refers to prolonged elevation of intracranial pressure, generally above 200 mm H2O. This condition may be recognized by the various clinical signs and symptoms that are manifest in most patients, including headache, papilledema, transient visual obscurations, diplopia, ocular motor disorders, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, and mental irregularities, as well as dysfunctions of the circulatory and respiratory systems. Thorough medical testing as well as a comprehensive ocular evaluation is indicated in these cases. Intracranial hypertension most commonly results from mass lesions, tension hydrocephalus, and pseudotumor cerebri. Other causes include disorders of venous outflow, such as dural sinus thromboses or arteriovenous malformations, and various encephalopathies. Management for intracranial hypertension may involve medical treatment, drug therapy, or surgical intervention. Typically, diuretics are used initially. Corticosteroids may be used as well, although they are not the first choice for treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid shunting procedures may be necessary if medical treatment fails. Optic nerve sheath decompression may also be attempted when chronic papilledema threatens visual function. It is important that the primary care optometrist recognize the manifestations of intracranial hypertension in order to make necessary referrals for management of the underlying etiologies.

Abstract
  We report a very unusual case of a patient with a previously undiagnosed congenital absence of the left dural venous drainage system and a prominent system on the right. Due to its prominence it was at risk during a cortical mastoidectomy performed as part of an endolymphatic sac decompression procedure. Manipulation of the lateral venous sinus resulted in partial occlusion of the already compromised venous drainage. The result was a rise in intra-cranial pressure and papilloedema, from which the patient recovered. The abnormality was only detected on post-operative imaging.

Abstract
  Traditional shunts were primarily designed to manage hydrocephalus by regulating intracranial pressure. However, in some circumstances, their performance characteristics can cause them to underdrain or overdrain CSF. Overdrainage has been linked with clinical complications such as valve-dependent shunt syndrome, cranial stenosis, slit-ventricle syndrome, and subdural hematomas, and it may contribute to ventricular catheter occlusion. In addition to complications associated with hypertension and ventriculomegaly, underdrainage has been linked with residual brain edema, and subcutaneous CSF effusion has been observed at the site of cranial perforation, mainly in pediatric patients. Newer designs attempt to reduce these complications, but fall short for various reasons. The author presents a new shunt design, which utilizes variable aperture technology (patent pending) that results in the physiologic regulation of CSF flow under both positive and negative pressure conditions. This new design offers encouragement for the management of hydrocephalus and the prevention of complications due to overdrainage.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The effects of epidural injection on intracranial pressure (ICP), lumbar epidural pressure, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) were studied after acutely increased ICP in swine.

   METHODS: Twenty pigs, anesthetized with isoflurane and mechanically ventilated to maintain normocarbia, had two Tuohy needles placed in the lumbar epidural space. The ICP, lumbar epidural pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and central venous pressure were monitored. All animals had a Fogarty catheter placed in the parietal epidural space. Six pigs were randomized to a normal ICP group (group N) and eight pigs to an increased ICP group by inflation of the Fogarty catheter balloon (group R). Each pig had 0.33 ml.kg-1 of 2.0% carbonated lidocaine injected over 20 s via an epidural needle placed at L3. The ICP and lumbar epidural pressure were then monitored continuously for 30 min. Pressure-time data were fit to traditional compartmental models. Epidural elastance and resistance were calculated using a derivation of the Windkessel theory. An additional six pigs had ICP elevated as in group R and CBF and SCBF measured using radioactive microspheres at five time periods: baseline, 0-60 s, 100-160 s, 200-260 s, and at 30 min after epidural injection.

   RESULTS: The animals did not differ with respect to heart rate, central venous pressure, or mean arterial pressure at baseline. The ICP was 10 +/- 2 mmHg in group N, and 24 +/- 2 mmHg after balloon inflation in group R. After epidural injection, peak ICP was significantly greater in group R (76 +/- 22 vs. 54 +/- 17 mmHg) but not different by 30 min (17 +/- 5 vs. 11 +/- 1 mmHg). Epidural elastance in group N was 8.3 +/- 3.1 mmHg.ml-1 and 12.8 +/- 3.0 mmHg.ml-1 in group R (P = 0.045). Epidural resistance was 1,330 +/- 590 mmHg.s.ml-1 in group N and 2,220 +/- 600 mmHg.s.ml-1 in group R (P = 0.038). The CBF and SCBF were less than 10% of baseline during the 0- to 60-s time period after epidural injection. Thereafter, CBF and SCBF did not differ from baseline values.

   CONCLUSIONS: In this porcine model, epidural injection increased ICP. With increased ICP at baseline, more pronounced increases in ICP followed epidural injection. With increased baseline ICP, both epidural elastance and resistance increased compared with controls. The CBF and SCBF were markedly reduced immediately after local anesthetic injection into the epidural space.

Abstract
  A 56-year-old female presented with chronic subdural hematoma due to spontaneous (primary) intracranial hypotension (SIH). She was admitted in a deep coma. Computed tomography showed bilateral chronic subdural hematomas with tight basal cisterns. Percutaneous aspiration of the chronic subdural hematoma with the twist drill revealed negative pressure. The neurological symptoms rapidly improved postoperatively, but the chronic subdural hematoma recurred three times, requiring further aspiration procedures. Patients with SIH may develop subdural hematoma requiring surgical treatment.

Abstract
  We prospectively analysed treatment results in patients with severe subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) who underwent early aneurysm surgery, and were managed by dehydration therapy. We studied a total of 31 patients with poor-grade SAH including 18 in grade IV, and 13 in grade V according to the WFNS classification system. Patients who were older than 70 years of age, or those with an intracerebral haemorrhage or absent brainstem response were excluded from this study. At surgery, clot evacuation from the peri-brainstem cisterns with/without external decompression was performed following obliteration of the aneurysmal neck. In the early postoperative period, patients were maintained in negative water balance using osmotic diuretics. When delayed ischaemic deficits had manifested themselves, the pulmonary wedge pressure and/or central venous pressure was immediately increased by the rapid injection of albumin until hypovolaemia reverted to normovolaemia with the continuous administration of dobutamine. The outcome at 3 months was good recovery in 16 (52%) patients, moderate disability in 3 (10%), severe disability in 5 (16%), a vegetative state in 1 (3%), and death in 6 (19%). We though that early aneurysm surgery and postoperative dehydration therapy in the acute stages of brain oedema resulting from primary brain damage are effective in the treatment of patients with severe SAH but reversible primary brain damage.

Abstract
  Arterial hypertension and/or tachycardia may alter intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients. We compared the effects of pancuronium 0.1 mg/kg and pipecuronium 0.1 mg/kg given as i.v. bolus on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure in 2 groups of 10 patients each scheduled for intracranial surgery in the supine position. Before surgery, no patient presented clinical symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Anesthesia was induced and maintained with fentanyl and midazolam. Ventilation with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen was adjusted to maintain arterial pCO2 at 30-35 mmHg. After induction of anesthesia, CSF pressure was registered via a lumbar subarachnoid catheter before and 3, 5, 10, and 30 min after pipecuronium or pancuronium administration. Hemodynamics were monitored using radial and pulmonary artery catheters. All variables underwent analyses of variance for repeated measures with p < 0.05 considered significant. Mean CSF pressure decreased insignificantly from 15 +/- 5 mmHg (before injection) to 14 +/- 4 mmHg in patients given pipecuronium and from 13 +/- 4 mmHg to 10 +/- 3 mmHg in the pancuronium group without significant differences between the study groups. Heart rate and arterial pressure increased significantly (p < 0.001) in patients given pancuronium but remained stable after pipecuronium. Onset and duration of neuromuscular blockade were comparable between groups. Based on our results, pipecuronium is a safe alternative to pancuronium during neurosurgical procedures in patients without abnormally high intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that diagnostic laparoscopy may be contraindicated in multiple trauma patients with closed head injuries because of the detrimental effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneum on intracranial pressure (ICP). In this study we compared the effects of two alternative inflation gases, helium (He) and nitrous oxide (N2O), against the standard agent used in most hospitals, CO2. ICP was monitored in experimental animals both with and without a space occupying intracranial lesion designed to simulate a closed head injury.

   METHODS: Twenty-four domestic pigs (mean, 30 kg) were divided into four groups (6 CO2, 6 He, 6 N2O, and 6 control animals without insufflation). All animals were monitored for ICP, intraabdominal pressure, mean arterial pressure, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), and arterial blood gases. These parameters were measured for 30 minutes prior to introducing a pneumoperitoneum and then for 80 minutes thereafter. The measurements were repeated after artificially elevating the ICP with a balloon placed in the epidural space.

   RESULTS: The mean ICP increased significantly in all groups during peritoneal insufflation compared with the control group (P < 0.005). The CO2-insufflated animals also showed a significant increase in PaCO2 (P < 0.05) and ETCO2 (P < 0.05), as well as a decrease in pH (P < 0.05). After inflating the epidural balloon the ICP remained significantly higher in animals inflated with CO2 as compared with the He and N2O groups (P < 0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: Peritoneal insufflation with He and N2O resulted in a significantly less increase in ICP as compared with CO2. That difference was most likely due to a metabolically mediated increase in cerebral perfusion (PaCO2) in the CO2 group. Further studies need to be conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of using He and N2O as inflation agents prior to attempting diagnostic or therapeutic laparoscopy in patients with potential closed head injuries.

Abstract
  Extremes of intracranial pressure commonly cause headache. Benign intracranial hypertension is a rare syndrome of increased intracranial pressure manifesting as headache, intracranial noises, transient visual obscuration, and palsy of the sixth cranial nerve. Endocrine disorders such as obesity and hypoparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis A, tetracycline use and thyroid replacement are probable causes of benign intracranial hypertension. In the majority of cases, however, it is idiopathic. Benign intracranial hypertension is though to be caused by cerebral edema, high cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance and high cerebral venous pressure, or a combination of the three. The management of benign intracranial hypertension includes, symptomatic headache relief, removal of offending risk factor(s), and medical or surgical reduction of intracranial pressure. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is more rare than benign intracranial hypertension. Postural headache (worse in the upright position) is the hallmark of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Typically, the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is less than 60 mm H2O. Diminished cerebrospinal fluid production, hyperabsorption, and leak are postulated mechanisms of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Empirical treatment includes bed rest, administration of caffeine, corticosteroids or mineralocorticoids, epidural blood patch, and epidural saline infusion. [References: 53]

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of suction catheter insertion and tracheal stimulation on cerebrovascular and systemic vascular status in adults with severe traumatic brain injury.

   DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, within-subject design.

   SETTING: Two university-affiliated critical care units.

   SUBJECTS: Thirty intubated and mechanically ventilated adults with severe brain injury. The participants' average age was 31 +/- 15 years.

   OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean intracranial pressure (MICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and heart rate (HR) were measured.

   INTERVENTION: Endotracheal suction catheter insertion with tracheal stimulation was performed.

   RESULTS: Suction catheter insertion and tracheal stimulation, isolated from other components of the suctioning procedure, significantly increased MICP, MAP, and CPP. HR was not significantly increased. During the application of negative pressure for actual suctioning, MICP and HR significantly increased, whereas MAP and CPP did not significantly change compared with catheter insertion.

   CONCLUSION: Tracheal stimulation during suction catheter insertion initiates both cerebrovascular and systemic vascular responses during the suctioning procedure. Study findings suggest that a potentially productive direction for intervention research is to identify ways to minimize airway stimulation during the suctioning procedure.

Abstract
  We experienced that therapeutic embolization of a large cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) led to venous outflow obstruction resulting in intracranial hypertension in a patient who had undergone external decompression. To evaluate hemodynamic changes after embolization, we monitored the cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the next four patients who underwent endovascular treatment. The embolization of a medium AVM resulted in a slight increase in the cerebrospinal fluid pressure. In two medium AVMs, embolization produced slight decreases in the cerebrospinal fluid pressure. In a small AVM, we did not observe any changes in the cerebrospinal fluid pressure during the endovascular treatment. We discuss the mechanism of changes in the intracranial pressure after embolization and conclude that monitoring of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure immediately yields useful information for hemodynamic changes during endovascular treatment.

Abstract
  Cerebral vasospasm remains the principal cause of morbidity and mortality following successful clipping of intracranial aneurysms. Current management often requires subjective judgments concerning presumed abnormalities of cerebral blood flow. In this study, a combined intracranial pressure (ICP)-laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) fiberoptic probe that permits continuous monitoring of local cerebral blood flow (lCBF) was used in the postoperative management of 20 aneurysm patients. Using this probe, lCBF was simultaneously recorded and integrated on a real time basis with other physiological parameters, including ICP, systemic arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and pulse oximetry. The combined probe also provided the ability to obtain precise and detailed information concerning the presence or absence of cerebral autoregulation and CO2 vascular reactivity, and allowed calculation of the cerebral vascular resistance. Continuous monitoring of lCBF in this manner complemented by transcranial Doppler and angiographic data permitted early detection of cerebral ischemia, helped to differentiate cerebral ischemia from edema and hyperemia, was useful in titrating blood pressure and fluid management, provided direct feedback about the effectiveness of instituted therapies, and determined early on when medical management was of no avail and that interventional neuroradiology was indicated. Evidence is presented that the presence of angiographic vasospasm and increased velocities on TCD do not always correlate with ischemia in the microcirculation and that direct measurements of lCBF are often at variance with calculations of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major cause of mortality in severe head injuries and pharmacologically induced cerebral vasoconstriction has been suggested as a possible treatment. In the present study a porcine model of increased ICP was utilized to study the changes in cerebral haemodynamics and energy metabolism induced by a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine1 agonist (sumatriptan).

   METHODS: ICP was raised by inflation of two balloons covering both parieto-occipital regions extradurally. The animals were randomized into four groups receiving sumatriptan. 0.01 mg.kg-1 (A), 0.03 mg.kg-1 (B), 0.1 mg.kg-1 (C), and 0.5 mg.kg-1 (D) intravenously over 10 min. Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterio-venous oxygen content difference (CavO2), and jugular venous pH (vpH) were performed 5, 20, 40, 60, and 75 min after start of the infusion. ICP, mean arterial pressure, and EEG were recorded continuously. Direct effects of sumatriptan were also compared in cortical arteries and veins in vitro.

   RESULTS: Significant decreases in ICP were obtained in groups A, B, and C while group D exhibited a progressive increase in ICP. Significant reductions in CBF, increase in CavO2, and slowing of EEG were observed in groups B, C, and D. Sumatriptan caused moderate constriction of the arteries and a more pronounced dilatation of veins in vitro.

   CONCLUSION: The results indicate that a low dose of sumatriptan has the potential to reduce a raised ICP. High doses of sumatriptan cause a further increase of ICP possibly by dilatation of intracerebral veins.

Abstract
  Cortical vein thrombosis without sinus involvement is rarely diagnosed, although it may commonly be overlooked. We report four cases of cerebral venous thrombosis limited to the cortical veins. The diagnosis was made on surgical intervention in one patient and by angiography in three patients. Together with a survey of the published cases, the clinical and neuroimaging patterns of our patients allow delineation of several features suggestive of cortical venous stroke. Focal or generalized seizures followed by hemiparesis, aphasia, hemianopia, or other focal neurologic dysfunction in the absence of signs of increased intracranial pressure should suggest this possibility. Neuroimaging (CT, MRI) shows an ischemic lesion that does not follow the boundary of arterial territories and often has a hemorrhagic component, without signs of venous sinus thrombosis. Conventional angiography demonstrates no arterial occlusion but may show cortical vein thrombosis corresponding to the infarct, although these may also be nonspecific findings. The role of MR angiography, which is well-established in sinus thrombosis, remains to be assessed in patients with brain ischemia due to isolated cortical vein occlusion.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The treatment of a large dural sinus fistula can be very difficult and complicated. The very extensive and complex nature of these malformations may require a combination therapy in the form of surgery and multistaged embolization. The transverse sinus fistula in our patient was fed by multiple large high-flow feeders and was draining retrograde into the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the cortical veins. The SSS did not fill in the late venous phase of the carotid angiogram, suggesting increased venous pressure.

   METHODS: A case of transverse sinus dural fistula is described that was managed by a combination of surgery and embolization. The complex nature of this malformation encouraged us to adopt a combination of multistaged embolization and surgery for the management and clinical control. The patient underwent embolization of multiple feeders from the branches of the external carotid artery. After this procedure, the patient underwent endovascular occlusion of the transverse sinus via the SSS. Throughout the endovascular treatment, the patient had concomitant intracranial pressure monitoring and SSS pressure monitoring, along with transcranial cerebral oximetry (TCCO). Despite this aggressive endovascular intervention, the fistula could not be completely closed. The patient then underwent surgical excision of the transverse sinus along with duraplasty and cranioplasty.

   RESULTS: The patient had a good recovery and posttreatment angiogram revealed normal antegrade flow in the SSS with no evidence of the fistula. The combined surgical and endovascular techniques are described and their use in clinical practice is discussed.

   CONCLUSIONS: The complexity of certain large dural sinus fistulae should not be underestimated. They may require a prolonged multistaged treatment for their total obliteration. Also, despite the large size and complexity of the disease, complete cure can be achieved.

Recent research has suggested that factors other than passive congestion of the cerebral vessels, resulting from increases in central venous pressure, may contribute to the ICP response. The current study evaluated this issue in a canine model of intracranial hypertension and additionally evaluated the relationship between ICP and static increases in superior vena caval pressure.

   METHODS: Six dogs were lightly anesthetized with 0.65% end-expired halothane in oxygen and nitrogen, and ventilation was mechanically controlled. Intracranial pressure was increased to a stable baseline of 15-20 mmHg using a subarachnoid infusion of warm 0.9% saline solution. The following variables were quantified before, and for 6 min after, initiating a 1-min noxious stimulus to the trachea and skin: ICP, central venous pressure, electromyograms (masseter, deltoid, and intercostal muscles), intrathoracic pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure (defined as mean arterial pressure -- ICP). Later, the protocol was repeated in the presence of neuromuscular block with pancuronium. Finally, in the same dogs, occlusion of the superior vena cava at its junction with the right atrium was used to increase superior vena caval pressure in 5-mmHg increments, from 5 to 30 mmHG, so that the resulting increases in ICP could be quantified.

   RESULTS: In unparalyzed dogs whose heads were maintained at the level of the right atrium, there was a 22-mmHg increase in ICP at 1 min after initiating the noxious stimulus (P<0.05). The ICP increase was related to electromyogram activation and a 6-mmHg increase in central venous pressure; however, it was not associated with significant increases in intrathoracic pressure or cerebral perfusion pressure. Treatment with pancuronium abolished the electromyographic, ICP, and central venous pressure responses to noxious stimulus. When superior vena caval pressure was statically manipulated, the resulting ICP increase was only one half the magnitude of the superior vena caval pressure increase. After elevating the head 14 cm, the ratio of ICP to superior vena pressure increases was reduced to one third.

   CONCLUSIONS: If these results apply to humans, it was concluded that increases in ICP that accompany movement in tracheally intubated patients may arise from two complementary factors: (1) cerebrovascular dilation that correlates with electromyographic activity and is mediated by ascending neural pathways that transmit proprioreceptive information, and (2) passive venous congestion that results from any increase in central venous pressure. The influence of the latter factor can be reduced by elevating the head. (Key words: Blood pressure, venous pressure; mean arterial pressure. Muscle: afferent activity; electromyograms, skeletal. Neuromuscular relaxants: pancuronium.)

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) upon intracranial (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) before and after intravascular volume resuscitation.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intra-abdominal pressure was increased in five anesthetized swine by inflating an intraperitoneal balloon until the IAP was 25 mm Hg above baseline. Intravascular volume was then expanded and finally abdominal decompression was performed. Changes in ICP and systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic parameters secondary to increasing IAP were measured. The effect upon CPP was derived from these measurements. PaO2 and PaCO2 were maintained relatively constant by increasing ventilatory rate.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Elevated IAP significantly increased ICP (7.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 21.4 +/- 1.0), pleural pressure and central venous pressure; whereas cardiac index and CPP (82.2 +/- 6.3 vs. 62.0 +/- 10.0) decreased significantly. Intravascular volume expansion further significantly increased ICP (27.8 +/- 1.0), and significantly increased both mean arterial pressure (83.4 +/- 14.0 versus 103.4 +/- 8.9) and CPP (75.6 +/- 9.0). Abdominal decompression returned ICP (11.2 +/- 1.8) toward baseline and further increased CPP (79.8 +/- 9.7).

   CONCLUSIONS: Elevated IAP increases ICP and decreases CPP and cardiac index. Volume expansion further increases ICP yet improves CPP via its greater positive effect upon mean arterial pressure (*p < 0.05, analysis of variance. All measurements are mean +/- SEM in mm Hg).

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To study practice in intensive care of patients with severe head injury in neurosurgical referral centres in United Kingdom.

   DESIGN: Structured telephone interview of senior nursing staff in intensive care unit of adult neurosurgical referral centre.

   SETTING: 39 intensive care units in hospitals that accepted acute head injuries for specialist neurosurgical management, identified from Medical Directory and information from professional bodies.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Details of organisation and administration of intensive care and patterns of monitoring and treatment for patients admitted with severe head injury.

   RESULTS: Patients were managed in specialist neurosurgical intensive care units in 21 of the centres and in general intensive care units in 18. Their intensive care was coordinated by an anaesthetist in 25 units and by a neurosurgeon in 12. Annual case-load varied between units: 20 received > 100 patients, 12 received 50-100, and seven received 25-49. Monitoring and treatment varied considerably between centres. Invasive arterial pressure monitoring was used routinely in 36 units, but central venous pressure monitoring was routinely used in 24 and intracranial pressure was routinely monitored in only 19. Corticosteroids were used to treat intracranial hypertension in 19 units. Seventeen units routinely aimed for arterial carbon dioxide pressure of 3.3-4.0 kPa, and one unit still used severe hyperventilation to a pressure of < 3.3 kPa.

   CONCLUSION: The intensive care of patients with acute head injuries varied widely between the centres surveyed. Rationalisation of the intensive care of severe head injury with the production of widely accepted guidelines ought to improve the quality of care.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Very little is known about the long-term outcome of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), particularly regarding the risk of residual epilepsy and further thrombotic events. We retrospectively studied 77 patients with CVT diagnosed by angiography and/or MRI.

   METHODS: A cohort of 77 patients aged 18 to 77 (mean, 38.5) years with CVT, evaluated from 1975 through 1990, was followed up for a mean of 77.8 months (range, 14 to 204 months; median, 63 months). Information on death, neurological status, seizures, recurrent CVT, other thrombotic events, and subsequent pregnancies was obtained from direct observation, mail questionnaire, or telephone interviews.

   RESULTS: Sixty-six of 77 patients (85.7%) had no neurological sequelae during follow-up. Eleven patients (14.3%) remained neurologically impaired. Two who initially presented with isolated intracranial hypertension had blindness due to optic atrophy. The other 9 had focal signs at the time of CVT and were left with various cognitive or focal deficits. Four of 28 (14.3%) patients who had seizures at the acute stage had recurrent seizures. One of the 51 patients with lateral sinus thrombosis developed a dural arteriovenous fistula. Nine of the 77 patients (11.7%) suffered a second CVT, all but one in the first year. Noncerebral thrombotic events occurred in 11 patients (14.3%). No recurrence of CVT occurred during later pregnancies, but 1 patient had a postpartum deep vein thrombosis.

   CONCLUSIONS: In the present series, CVT has an essentially good long-term prognosis. The frequency of long-standing epilepsy was low, suggesting that long-term anticonvulsant treatment is not necessary in the majority of cases. A second CVT or another thrombotic episode occurred in 20% of patients, stressing the need in a minority of cases for long-term anticoagulation.

Abstract
  The clinical symptoms of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) depend mainly on the site and venous drainage pattern of the lesion. The goal of treatment of the lesion is the permanent and complete elimination of the arteriovenous shunt. Transarterial embolization or stereotactic radiation may affect feeding arteries or nidus. The involved sinus can be obliterated by percutaneous or surgical transvenous embolization, or resected by surgery. In cases of patients with pure leptomeningeal drainage, surgical interruption of leptomeningeal drainage may be effective. Based on the experiences reported in the literature, transarterial embolization of accessible feeding arteries is the initial treatment to decrease arterial blood flow. Transvenous embolization may be effective depending on the venous drainage pattern. For the AVFs remaining after transarterial embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery is recommended if feasible. Transvenous embolization may be applied cautiously considering the risk of venous hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage. Direct microsurgery is indicated if stereotactic radiosurgery is not performed safely. For cases without dural sinus drainage, surgical interruption of leptomeningeal drainage may be applied safely. The decision to intervene in dural AVFs is based on the following factors: age and general condition of the patient, severity of the presenting symptoms, natural history of the lesion if left untreated, angiographic features on the location of dural AVFs and the venous drainage pattern, and morbidity and mortality of the procedure being considered.

Abstract
  A survey of the 31 neurosurgical units in Australia and New Zealand was undertaken by the Trauma Committee of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia to determine areas of common practice and areas of divergence in management protocols in the treatment of moderate and severe head injury. Intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement was a fundamental component of care in the majority of units with rises in ICP being treated by sedation, mild hyperventilation (p(a)CO(2) of 30-35 mm Hg) and osmotherapy or cerebrospinal fluid drainage as first choices. Where the ICP was measured selectively following a severe head injury, the computed tomography appearance was used as the criterion for initiation of measurement. All units used at least an arterial line, a central venous pressure monitor and end-tidal CO(2) measurement routinely to monitor progress. Attention to the cerebral perfusion pressure with volume support and pressors, together with less intense hyperventilation, were the most common alterations to management protocols made over the preceding 2 years.

Abstract
  SUMMARY: We review 29 children (presenting between 1985-1996) with dural arteriovenous shunts. By analysing the anatomical features from axial and angiographic imaging and examining the clinical history and pathophysiological characteristics, we hypothesize that different diseases can be distinguished and divided into three groups: dural sinus malformation (DSM), infantile type of dural arteriovenous shunts (IDAVS) and adult type of dural arteriovenous shunts (ADAVS). It was helpful to classify these diseases when assessing the treatment options and long-term prognosis. Our group of 29 children comprised 19 DSM, 7 IDAVS, 3 ADAVS. A slight male preponderance was noted in the DSM group. The range of symptoms encountered included mild cardiac failure and coagulopathies, macrocrania, developmental delay, mental retardation, seizures and focal neurological deficits (in the neonates and early infancy age group) with or without haemorrhagic venous infarctions secondary to venous outlet restriction. We found all types of lesion in the neonatal age group, but in general the different types of lesion correspond to the paediatric subgroups with DSM occurring in the neonatal age group, IDAVS in infancy and ADAVS in children. DSMs are revealed in the first few months of live and the prognosis is good if the torcular is not involved. Two types can be seen: 1) DSM involving the posterior sinus with or without the confluens sinusum, with giant dural lakes and slow flow mural AV shunting. Spontaneous thrombosis may further restrict cerebral venous drainage and subsequently lead to intraparenchymatous haemorrhagic infarction. 2) DSM involving the jugular bulb with otherwise normal sinuses but associated with a high flow sigmoi'd sinus AVF. The prognosis is excellent with embolisation treament. IDAVS are high flow and low pressure. The sinuses are large and patent with no lakes. Clinical onset is seen in the first few years of life and the shunts are initially well tolerated. Progressive symptoms (symptoms of raised ICP and venous ischaemia) develop at a later age and initially respond to partial embolisation. The long term prognosis is poor with neurological deterioration in early adulthood. ADAVS present in all age groups and almost all of them are located in the cavernous venous plexus. Post embolisation outcome is excellent.

Abstract
  The cerebrovascular response to the administration of equipotent doses of fentanyl and sufentanil was evaluated in New Zealand white rabbits following cryogenic brain injury. In a preliminary study consisting of 10 animals, it was documented that the cerebral blood flow response to alterations in the PaCO2 remained intact in this model of brain injury. Subsequently, 28 rabbits were anesthetized with 1.5% halothane in oxygen, paralyzed with pancuronium, and mechanically ventilated. A cryogenic lesion was created over the left hemisphere. One hour later, the intracranial pressure had risen to a mean value of 15 mm Hg. Baseline measurements were then made of monitored variables, which included heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, temperature, and arterial blood gases. Global cerebral blood flow was measured utilizing a hydrogen clearance technique. The animals were then randomized to receive an infusion of fentanyl (N = 9, 200 microg/kg), sufentanil (N = 10, 20 microg/kg), or an equal volume of normal saline (N = 9) by i.v. infusion over 5 min. At the conclusion of the opioid infusions, repeated measurements of hemodynamic variables and intracranial pressure were recorded for 15 min and a second cerebral blood flow measurement was made. There were no significant differences in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, cerebral blood flow, or blood gas values between the three groups prior to the administration of fentanyl, sufentanil, or normal saline. At the conclusion of the 5 min infusion, the intracranial pressure had increased by approximately 5 mm Hg in all three groups. The mean arterial pressure decreased to a similar degree in the fentanyl and sufentanil groups and was significantly lower than the mean arterial pressure in the saline group. Although the cerebral perfusion pressure decreased in all three groups, cerebral blood flow was not significantly affected. These results suggest that there is no significant difference in the effects of fentanyl vs. sufentanil on mean arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, or cerebral blood flow in this model of acute brain injury and elevated intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  Twenty patients with expansive pathologic intracranial lesions, who were anesthetized with thiopental, nitrous oxide in oxygen, and fentanyl and mechanically ventilated to ensure normocarbia, received pipecuronium bromide 70 microg/kg i.v. Intracranial pressure (ICP), heart rate, arterial pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), EKG, and end-tidal CO2 were simultaneously recorded for 5 min before and for 15 min after administration of the muscle relaxant. No statistically significant changes in ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure were observed after administration of pipecuronium bromide. Cardiovascular stability was maintained during the study period except for a small, although significant, decrease of the CVP from 5.7 +/- 2.5 (SEM) to 5.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg. These results, together with the long-lasting muscular effect of pipecuronium bromide, suggest that this new neuromuscular blocking agent may be used for muscle relaxation during neurosurgical operations in patients who have normal intracranial pressure at the time of administration of the drug.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cerebrovascular response to changes in arterial CO2 tension during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in normoxaemic and hypoxaemic piglets.

   METHODS: Four groups of six anaesthetized, paralysed and mechanically ventilated piglets: group 1-normoxaemia without ECMO, group 2-ECMO after normoxaemia, group 3-hypoxaemia without ECMO, and group 4-ECMO after hypoxaemia, were exposed successively to hypercapnia and hypocapnia. Changes in cerebral concentrations of oxyhaemoglobin (cO2Hb), deoxyhaemoglobin (cHHb), (oxidized-reduced) cytochrome aa3 (cCyt.aa3) and blood volume (CBV) were continuously measured using near infrared spectrophotometry. Heart rate, arterial O2 saturation, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure (ICP) and left common carotid artery blood flow (LCaBF) were measured simultaneously.

   RESULTS: Hypercapnia resulted in increased CBV, cO2Hb and ICP in all groups, while cHHb was decreased. No changes in LCaBF were found. Hypocapnia resulted in decreased cO2Hb and increased cHHb except in group 3. LCaBF decreased in all groups except group 2. CBV decreased only in groups 2 and 4. No effect on ICP was observed in any of the groups. The other variables showed no important changes either during hypercapnia or hypocapnia. ECMO after hypoxaemia resulted in a greater response of cO2Hb and cO2Hb and cHHb during hypocapnia. The effect of hypercapnia on CBV while on ECMO was greater than without ECMO.

   CONCLUSION: Since cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 remains intact during ECMO in piglets, it is important to keep arterial CO2 tension stable and in normal range during clinical ECMO.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Although their assessment could be of the utmost importance to determine the surgical treatment for patients with univentricular hearts, differences in ventricular performance between partial and complete right heart bypass remain to be defined.

   METHODS: Three different degrees of right heart bypass were investigated in 5 mongrel dogs: (1) superior vena cava to both pulmonary arteries shunt (SCP); (2) inferior vena cava to both pulmonary arteries shunt (ICP); and (3) both venae cavae to both pulmonary arteries shunt (BCP). Hemodynamic studies included evaluation of the cardiac index and left atrial pressure as a function of the degree of right heart bypass.

   RESULTS: By maintaining the mean left atrial pressure at 5 mm Hg, cardiac indexes were 1.98 +/- 0.25, 1.67 +/- 0.29, and 1.33 +/- 0.21 L.min-1.m-2 for SCP, ICP, and BCP shunts, respectively (p = 0.001). When keeping the cardiac index constant, mean left atrial pressures were 5.2 +/- 0.8, 5.5 +/- 0.9, and 7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg for SCP, ICP, and BCP shunts, respectively (p = 0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: Increasing degrees of right heart bypass are associated with a significant decrease in ventricular performance in this experimental model.

Abstract
  Although sufentanil is frequently used in neuroanesthesia, the effect of the drug on intracranial pressure is still controversial. In our study, we used an invasive measurement technique to study the effects of 0.1 micrograms/kg-1 sufentanil on mean lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), central venous pressure (CVP), heart rate (HR), and end-tidal dioxide (ETCO2) in five human volunteers. After i.v. injection of sufentanil, mean lumbar CSFP increased from 6 mm Hg to 12 mm Hg (p < 0.05), and mean CPP decreased from 92 mm Hg to 78 mm Hg (p < 0.05), whereas MAP, CVP, HR, and ETCO2 remained stable. The results of this study clearly show that even a low dose of sufentanil transiently increases lumbar CSFP in volunteers with uncompromised intracranial compliance.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: To review the symptoms and progression of dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and correlate the findings with various angiographic patterns.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patterns of venous drainage allowed classification of dural AVFs into five types: type I, located in the main sinus, with antegrade flow; type II, in the main sinus, with reflux into the sinus (IIa), cortical veins (IIb), or both (IIa + b); type III, with direct cortical venous drainage without venous ectasia; type IV, with direct cortical venous drainage with venous ectasia; and type V, with spinal venous drainage.

   RESULTS: Type I dural AVFs had a benign course. In type II, reflux into the sinus induced intracranial hypertension in 20% of cases, and reflux into cortical veins induced hemorrhage in 10%. Hemorrhage was present in 40% of cases of type III dural AVFs and 65% of type IV. Type V produced progressive myelopathy in 50% of cases.

   CONCLUSION: This classification provides useful data for determination of the risk with each dural AVF and enables decision-making about the appropriate therapy.

Abstract
  Intracranial pressure and cardiovascular variables after IV administration of medetomidine (0.03 mg/kg of body weight) were evaluated in 6 healthy, mixed-breed dogs anesthetized with 1.3% end-tidal isoflurane concentration and mechanically ventilated to normocapnia (PaCO2, 35 to 45 mm of Hg). Baseline values were determined for intracranial pressure, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, end-tidal CO2 tension and isoflurance concentration, arterial pH and CO2 and O2 tensions, and core body temperature. Cerebral perfusion pressure, cardiac index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, plasma HCO3- concentration, and base excess were calculated. Intracranial pressure was measured, using a calibrated, fiberoptic transducer placed within the brain parenchyma and secured to the calvarium by means of a subarachnoid bolt. Cardiac output was determined by thermodilution. End-tidal CO2 tension and isoflurane concentration were determined, using an infrared gas analyzer. Administration of medetomidine did not change intracranial pressure, but was associated with significant (P < 0.05) decreases in values for heart rate, cardiac index, end-tidal CO2, and HCO3- and with significant increases in systolic, mean, and diastolic pressure; pulmonary artery pressure; systemic vascular resistance; central venous pressure; and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

Abstract
  Meningiomas arising from the falcotentorial junction are extremely rare. The authors describe the clinical features, neuroimaging studies, and results of surgical treatment of meningiomas of the falcotentorial junction and clarify the characteristics of this lesion based on a review of the literature and seven patients treated at their institution. The most common symptoms resulted from intracranial hypertension. Upward-gaze palsy appeared in only one patient. Computerized tomography (CT) showed no specific findings, but there was no evidence of edema around the tumor. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a round, smooth-bordered mass with a peritumoral rim, without edema, and showing marked contrast enhancement. The multiplanar capability of MR imaging delineated the relationship between the tumor and adjacent structures better than did CT. Detailed knowledge of the vascular structures, especially evidence of occlusion of the galenic venous system and the development of collateral venous channels, is critical for successful surgery; stereoscopic cerebral angiography is necessary to achieve this aim. The seven patients described developed five types of collateral venous channels: through the basal vein of Rosenthal to the petrosal vein, through the veins on the medial surface of the parietal and occipital lobes to the superior sagittal sinus, through superficial anastomotic veins, through veins of the posterior fossa to the transverse or straight sinus, and through the falcian veins to the superior sagittal sinus. The first three types mainly developed after occlusion of the galenic system. The tumors were removed through the occipital transtentorial approach with a large window at the posterior part of the falx. A favorable prognosis for patients undergoing surgical treatment of falcotentorial junction meningiomas can be expected if detailed neuroimaging studies and microsurgical techniques are used.

Abstract
  Two cases of children with closed myelodysplasia, Arnold-Chiari malformation, and shunted hydrocephalus who underwent spinal arachnoid cystopleural shunting are presented. Postoperatively, both patients developed craniovertebral symptomatology accompanied by radiologically documented ventricular dilation in spite of negative intracranial pressure and functional ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. Both patients recovered after the cystopleural shunts were revised to increase the resistance to flow within the system. The authors believe that some communication between the arachnoid cyst and the subarachnoid space existed in both cases and that the negative pleural pressure was transmitted preferentially to the spinal and cerebral convexity subarachnoid spaces with relative sparing of the ventricular system. A transmantle pressure gradient was thereby established, leading to ventricular dilation. The authors further suggest that a craniospinal gradient was possibly established as well, leading to craniovertebral symptomatology in the patients. Return of flow in the VP shunts was obtained by correcting this iatrogenic transmantle pressure gradient.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To characterize the neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of impaired cranial venous outflow.

   DESIGN: A retrospective study of 20 patients who developed increased intracranial pressure as the result of impaired cerebral drainage.

   SETTING: Three neuro-ophthalmologic referral centers.

   PATIENTS: Ten patients had noncompressive thrombosis of sagittal or lateral sinuses (noncompressive group), four had compression of the sagittal sinus or jugular veins (compressive group), and six had transient sinus thrombosis following surgical procedures (iatrogenic group).

   INTERVENTIONS: Medical and/or surgical treatment of increased intracranial pressure and of underlying conditions predisposing to venous obstruction.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms (headache and esodeviation) and signs (visual acuity, visual fields, and optic disc appearance) of increased intracranial pressure.

   RESULTS: Headache was more severe, esodeviation was more prevalent, and onset was more abrupt in the noncompressive group than in the compressive and iatrogenic groups. Among the 10 patients with noncompressive thrombosis, factors predisposing to thrombosis were present in seven patients but sometimes overlooked. Following treatment, visual outcome was generally favorable in all three groups. All patients had 20/30 or better visual acuity in at least one eye, and substantial visual field loss was present in both eyes of only two patients.

   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestation of impaired cerebral venous outflow vary depending on the underlying mechanism. Although most patients maintain good vision, more aggressive treatment is sometimes indicated in patients with thrombosis or compression. The abrupt onset and marked severity of symptoms in patients with thrombosis should help to differentiate these patients from those with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Abstract
  A 20 year old woman was admitted to our Department 15 days after the onset of typhoid fever treated with chloramphenicol. The patient showed intracranial hypertension with generalized seizures, slight right hemiparesis and a left VI cranial nerve deficit with diplopia. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed occlusion of the superior longitudinal, right transverse, right sigmoid sinus combined with a single hemorrhagic infarct in the left occipito-parietal area. Serum tests were positive for Salmonella Paratyphi A and B. The results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination were normal and blood cultures were negative. Clinical data, laboratory and MRI examinations indicate that the neurological signs are the result of aseptic cerebral sinus thrombosis; the physiopathologic mechanisms of the case are discussed.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To answer the following questions: a) Does jugular venous ligation (simulating venovenous extracorporeal life support) alter proximal jugular venous pressure, intracranial pressure, hemispheric cerebral blood flow, or cerebral metabolism? b) Does release of ligation reverse these effects? and c) What are the comparative effects of venous ligation alone vs. venous ligation in combination with arterial ligation?

   DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, laboratory investigation.

   SETTING: Multidisciplinary laboratory setting.

   SUBJECTS: Sixteen swine, weighing 8.1 to 12.1 kg, 3 to 4 wks of age.

   INTERVENTIONS: Sixteen swine were randomly assigned to two groups, utilizing a random sequence of vessel ligation. Nine swine underwent occlusion of the right internal and external jugular veins alone (venovenous ligation) followed by release of the occlusion and then occlusion of the right common carotid artery and the right internal and external jugular veins together (venoarterial ligation). The remaining seven swine underwent venoarterial ligation, followed by release of the occlusion and then venovenous ligation. In the experimental group in which venovenous ligation was performed first, the 5, and 30-min release periods after ligation were taken to represent the effects of draining the right jugular vein during venovenous extracorporeal life support.

   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were obtained at baseline, 5, and 30 mins after each ligation/release period. Intracranial pressure, right and left internal jugular pressures/flow rates, and cerebral sinus lactate concentrations were measured. Cerebral blood flow was determined using 133Xe clearance methodology, and the cerebral metabolic rate was calculated. There were no significant differences between the ipsilateral internal jugular pressure or extracorporeal life support at 5 or 30 mins after venovenous or venoarterial ligation compared with baseline values or compared with the release of the ligation at 5 or 30 mins. There was a significant increase in right-side (44.7 +/- 2.0 vs. 38.8 +/- 2.4 mL/kg/min; p < .05) and left-side (42.9 +/- 2.3 vs. 38.7 +/- 1.9 mL/kg/min; p < .05) cerebral blood flow 5 mins after venovenous ligation when compared with baseline values. Similarly, after venoarterial ligation, there was a significant increase in right-side (44.6 +/- 2.2 vs. 38.8 +/- 2.4 mL/kg/min; p < .05) and left-side (43.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 38.7 +/- 1.9 mL/kg/min; p < .05) and cerebral blood flow. Cerebral oxygen consumption was significantly increased after venovenous (2.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 mL/kg/min; p < .05) and venoarterial (2.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.1 +/- 0.2 mL/kg/min; p < .05) ligation at 5 mins after ligation. This increase persisted at the 30-min period and after release of ligation.

   CONCLUSIONS: Ligation of the right jugular veins alone (venovenous ligation) or jugular veins and right carotid artery (venoarterial ligation) does not increase jugular venous pressures or intracranial pressure. However, this procedure does increase cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption. These findings demonstrate that there is adequate decompression of the venous system by the cerebrovascular system and retrograde decompression during extracorporeal life support appears unwarranted.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the effects of colloid osmotic pressure on cerebral edema formation after brain injury. We hypothesized that an increase in plasma oncotic pressure accompanying a colloid infusion would be associated with a decrease in intracranial pressure and increases in cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery when compared with isotonic crystalloid.

   DESIGN: Prospective, laboratory study.

   SETTING: University surgical research laboratory.

   SUBJECTS: Adult swine, both genders.

   INTERVENTIONS: Cryogenic brain injury with intravenous fluid infusion of either lactated Ringer's solution or 6% dextran-70 in normal saline. The effect of this intervention was monitored for 24 hrs.

   MEASUREMENTS: Mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, hemoglobin concentration, plasma oncotic pressure, serum osmolality, cerebral blood flow, and specific gravity of cortical biopsies.

   RESULTS: Cryogenic injury significantly increased the cortical water content and the intracranial pressure and significantly decreased the cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery (p < .05). Dextran infusion significantly increased the colloid oncotic pressure. There were no differences between the lactated Ringer's solution and dextran groups in intracranial pressure, cerebral oxygen delivery, or cortical water content after 24 hrs.

   CONCLUSIONS: Colloid infusion after a focal cryogenic injury does not increase cerebral oxygen delivery or reduce either cerebral edema formation or intracranial pressure when compared with lactated Ringer's solution. Colloid is not superior to isotonic crystalloid in the management of isolated brain injury.

Abstract
  A case of unruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) presenting benign intracranial hypertension is reported. A 14-year-old male suffered from headache and papilledema. Intracranial pressure was 260 mmH2O. Unenhanced CT demonstrated no evidence of hemorrhage or hydrocephalus. Angiogram demonstrated a large AVM in the left temporal lobe supplied by the left posterior cerebral artery and left middle cerebral artery. It drained into the transverse sinus. Surgical excision of the AVM eliminated the headache and papilledema. AVM causes hemorrhage in 50% of cases, seizure in 30%, and other focal neurological deficits in 20%. Benign intracranial hypertension is an uncommon effect of unruptured AVMs. Only 13 cases have been reported in the literature. Benign intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured AVMs occurs in young patients with high flow AVMs that drain into the major sinus. The mechanism of intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured AVM is unknown. However, there are several possible mechanisms of intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured AVMs. The arterial blood shunting into a major sinus impedes venous return from the surrounding brain. That causes the increase of cerebral blood volume and the elevation of sinus pressure. This mechanism would reduce CSF absorption and would increase intracranial pressure. Pharmacological therapy is ineffective in controlling intracranial hypertension. Surgical excision of AVM effectively reduced intracranial hypertension. Thus, surgical excision of AVMs, if it can be done with low risk, is the treatment of choice to decrease intracranial hypertension in patients with unruptured cerebral AVMs. [References: 6]

Abstract
  The pathophysiology of cerebral venous infarctions is poorly understood, due partially to the lack of a suitable experimental model. Therefore, we developed a model in rats to study acute and long-term changes of brain function and morphology following thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. The superior sagittal sinus of rats was exposed, ligated, and injected with thrombogenic material. Thrombosis of the longitudinal sinus and ascending cortical veins was monitored by intravital fluorescence angiography. Histology was studied at 24 h and 4 weeks after thrombosis and changes in intracranial pressure, electroencephalogram (EEG), and tissue impedance were noted. Spontaneous locomotor activity was followed for 4 weeks after thrombosis. The effect of heparin treatment on tissue impedance was evaluated. Thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus could be regularly induced, although pathological sequelae developed only if ascending veins were affected. Sinus and venous thrombosis was histologically characterized by bilateral, parasagittal infarctions. Thrombosis induction was followed by an increase in intracranial pressure from 4.7 +/- 1.6 to 12.8 +/- 2.4 mm Hg (n = 4) at 1 h after thrombosis, associated with an exponential rise in tissue impedance to 165 +/- 14% (n = 8) of the control. EEG changes were similar to those following global cerebral ischemia and remained pathological for up to 6 months after thrombosis (n = 6). As a permanent behavioral deficit spontaneous locomotor activity was reduced to 60 +/- 10% (n = 6) of the control. Finally, the administration of heparin (1 IU/g body weight) after thrombosis induction was found to reverse the pathological tissue impedance response of the brain. In conclusion, involvement of ascending cortical veins following sinus thrombosis appears to be critical for the development of irreversible tissue damage, such as infarction. Changes in intracranial pressure and tissue impedance suggest that the venous thrombosis was followed by brain edema of a predominantly cytotoxic nature. Venous thrombosis led to long-term changes of brain function, as demonstrated by persistent disturbances of the EEG or of the spontaneous locomoter drive. These deficits may be amenable to treatment with heparin.

Abstract
  Hydrostatic pressure is a force applied by a liquid on the surface of an immersed body. Inside the circulatory system it depends on the weight of the blood column between the heart and a given level. In neurosurgical patients, the hydrostatic pressure plays an important role in cerebral perfusion, transcapillary fluid movements and venous air embolism. The mean arterial pressure (Pa), the CSF pressure (CSFP) and the pressure in the jugular vein (JVP) are the hydrostatic determiners of the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The hydrostatic pressure gradient associated with head raising decreases Pa, cerebral venous pressure and JVP, decreases or increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and decreases CPP. The consequences of the resulting hypoperfusion depend on the status of autoregulation. When the skull is open, the pressure under the cerebral retractors determines the transmural pressure and cerebral perfusion. The transcapillary fluid movements depend on a permeability coefficient, a hydrostatic pressure gradient and an osmotic pressure gradient. In case of a rupture of blood brain barrier (BBB), the increase of Pa and the decrease of ICP (craniotomies) favour the development of vasogenic oedema. When the Pa stands higher than the upper limit of autoregulation, the hydrostatic capillary pressure increases. It results in a vasodilation, an increase of cerebral blood flow and oedema, the lesion of BBB being initiated by an increase of the amount and the activity of the pinocytotic vesicles in endothelial cells. The syndrome of BBB rupture at a normal CPP is the consequence of an increase in hydrostatic pressure in the dilated capillary territory and can make more difficult the surgical treatment of arterio-venous malformations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract
  Bedrest studies of normal subjects provide opportunities to understand physiologic responses to supine posture and inactivity. Furthermore, head-down tilt has been a valuable procedure to investigate adaptation to microgravity and development of countermeasures to maintain the health and well-being of humans during space-flight. Recent bedrest experiments at NASA have ranged in duration from a few hours to 17 weeks. Acute studies of 6 degrees head-down tilt indicate that elevation of capillary blood pressure from 28 to 34 mm Hg and increased capillary perfusion in tissues of the head cause facial and intracranial edema. Intracranial pressure increases from 2 to 17 mm Hg going from upright posture to 6 degrees head-down tilt. Microvessels of the head have a low capacity to constrict and diminish local perfusion. Elevation of blood and tissue fluid pressures/flow in the head may also explain the higher headward bone density associated with long-term head-down tilt. These mechanistic studies of head-down tilt, along with a better understanding of the relative stresses involved with upright posture and lower body negative pressure, have facilitated development of suitable physiologic countermeasures to maintain astronaut health during microgravity. Presently no exercise hardware is available to provide a blood pressure gradient from head to feet in space. However, recent studies in our laboratory suggest that treadmill exercise using a graded lower-body compression suit and 100 mmHg lower body negative pressure provides equivalent or greater physiologic stress than similar upright exercise on Earth. Therefore, exercise within a lower body negative pressure chamber may provide a cost-effective and simple countermeasure to maintain the cardiovascular and neuro-musculoskeletal systems of astronauts during long-duration flight.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: To investigate rapid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in infants in relation to respiration and cardiac cycle.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: CSF-flow signals were detected in 35 of 526 consecutive infants (22 male and 13 female infants, aged 1-30 days) who underwent 140 color flow and pulsed Doppler ultrasonographic studies at the cerebral aqueduct. In infants with spontaneous CSF flow, Doppler spectrum and respiratory signal or electrocardiogram were recorded simultaneously.

   RESULTS: In 64 examinations performed in 20 infants, CSF flow was induced by abdominal pressure change only. Among 76 examinations performed in 15 infants, CSF flow was synchronous to spontaneous respiration in 28 examinations, to mechanical ventilation in nine, to the cardiac cycle in 15, and to both respiratory and heart rates in 24.

   CONCLUSION: Respiration-modulated CSF flow predominates in infants without significant intracranial disease. Pulsation or CSF solely or mainly synchronous to the cardiac cycle is associated with conditions causing increased intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  A computer model of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment and various shunt designs was developed to simulate CSF dynamics, particularly in the upright position in which siphoning is known to occur. This novel mathematical model of the CSF compartment incorporates negative pressure and volume components that permit simulation of siphoning. The model was tested with data from a previously reported animal experiment. The correspondence between the model simulation and the reported intracranial pressure and CSF shunt flow rate was very good. A simulation of a shunted hydrocephalic patient in the recumbent and upright position was then carried out to examine the effects of a standard shunt valve, an externally adjustable valve, a variable resistance valve, and an antisiphon device. The resulting pressure profiles, which conformed to previously reported data, indicate that this model would be useful for the evaluation of current and future shunt designs.

Abstract
  The abdominal intraperitoneal cerebrospinal fluid pseudocyst is an infrequent but important complication in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Since 1954, 115 cases of paediatric pseudocysts have been reported in the literature. One additional report deals with an adult patient. We report on 14 cases of sonographically diagnosed abdominal pseudocysts. Their aetiology, diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms and surgical management are investigated. In our hydrocephalus series we have an incidence of pseudocyst formation of 4.5%. The most common presentation of the paediatric patients is with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure and abdominal pain, whereas the adults have predominantly local abdominal signs. Diagnosis is readily made with ultrasonography. Predisposing factors for pseudocyst formation are multiple shunt revisions and infection. Microscopically, the pseudocysts consist of fibrous tissue without epithelial lining. The treatment involves surgical removal of the catheter with or without excision of the pseudocyst wall and placement of a new catheter intraperitoneally in a different quadrant or an intra-atrial shunt. Recurrences are rare, especially under appropriate medical treatment of infection. In our series, microbiologically proven infection was present in 30% of the cases. [References: 35]

Abstract
  The effects of an anti-siphon device (ASD) on shunt flow and intracranial pressure (ICP) in 16 children with hypertensive hydrocephalus were examined using quantitative radionuclide shuntography (99mTc) with the children in supine and sitting positions. The average age of these patients was 9.5 years. Results were compared with those recorded in 36 patients with adult normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The closing pressure levels of shunt valve used were low in 8 cases, medium in 7 and high in 1. Half the children (8) had shunt systems with, and the other 8 without, ASD. In the children who had the shunt system without ASD, sitting shunt flow was significantly greater than supine shunt flow, which indicated overdrainage. Conversely, in children who had the shunt system with ASD, supine shunt flow was greater than sitting shunt flow. Because ASD prevented overdrainage, ICP was higher with the shunt system with ASD than with the shunt system without ASD. Without ASD, sitting shunt flow of children was lower than that of adult patients with NPH because of the lower hydrostatic pressure, which correlated with their height. Conversely, in the presence of a shunt system with ASD, sitting shunt flow of children was greater than that of adults, because of the higher ICP and lower hydrostatic pressure. The effect of ASD was smaller in children than in adults, because positive pressure over the ASD was greater (hypertension vs normal pressure) and negative pressure under the ASD was less (short vs tall) in children than in adults. Thus, in children the ASD was effective in preventing overdrainage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract
  PS Medical has advanced the state-of-the-art in hydrocephalus valve technology with the introduction of the Delta Valve. The Delta Valve is designed upon the premise that the shunted patient should have intracranial pressure (ICP) maintenance within a normal range regardless of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow rate or body position. All previous valves have performance characteristics that are greatly influenced by the negative hydrostatic pressure caused by the gravitational effect on the vertical water column in the distal catheter. This negative pressure influence is non-physiologic and contributes directly to overdrainage that can cause slit ventricles, subdural hematoma, and proximal catheter occlusions. The Delta Valve is the only valve that maintains a near-constant pressure gradient regardless of flow rate or patient posture. It automatically adjusts for increasing negative pressures in the distal catheter by proportionally increasing its resistance to flow, thus nullifying the adverse effects of the hydrostatic force on intracranial pressures. The result is a shunt system that provides for CSF drainage while allowing the patient's normal physiologic conditions to control ICP. The early use of the Delta Valve in the treatment of hydrocephalus may reduce the incidence of the dramatic complications associated with overdrainage.

Abstract
  Fenoldopam (FE), a dopamine DA1-receptor agonist, has been introduced for treatment of arterial hypertension and heart failure and for preservation of renal function. Vasodilators are generally assumed to affect all vascular beds including the cerebral circulation. We have evaluated effects of FE-induced (4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) arterial hypotension on intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) under conditions of normal and increased intracranial elastance. ICP and IOP responses to hypertension were tested by infusion of angiotensin II (15 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), and the response to hypercapnia was tested by elimination and reintegration of soda lime canisters in the breathing circuit. Intracranial elastance was increased by infusing mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the lateral ventricle (20 +/- 3 ml.h-1). Arterial hypotension induced with FE did not increase ICP. With increased intracranial elastance, the infusion rate of mock CSF had to be reduced while administering FE to avoid a rise in ICP (p < 0.05 compared with preinfusion value); this indicates a shift on the volume-pressure curve to the right. There were no indicators that cerebral autoregulation or CO2 reactivity of the cerebral vasculature were affected by FE in this anesthetized porcine model, as speculated from analysis of the time course of delta ICP. There are, however, indicators of increased intracranial elastance, most likely caused by vasodilation. Caution should hence be exercised when FE is administered to patients with increased intracranial elastance.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess local haemodynamic effects of raised tissue pressure per se and of arterial and venous pressure variations during raised tissue pressure, and to evaluate the vascular waterfall phenomenon.

   DESIGN: An isolated pump-perfused sympathectomised cat skeletal muscle enclosed in a plethysmograph.

   INTERVENTIONS: Hydrostatic capillary pressure (Pc), tissue volume alterations and blood flow were recorded at various arterial (PA) or venous (PV) pressure levels at a raised tissue pressure (Ptissue). Total vascular resistance (Rtot) and its three consecutive sections, arterial resistance (Rart), venular resistance (Rvenule), and venous outflow orifice resistance (Rorifice), were recorded.

   RESULTS: Increase in Ptissue increased Pc due to a marked increase in Rorifice and unchanged Rart and, when Ptissue > PV, by about 90% of the Ptissue increase. During the raised Ptissue, a PA increase (95 to 115 mmHg) increased Pc (by 3.1 +/- 1.1 mmHg) causing fluid filtration, and a PA decrease (95 to 75 mmHg) decreased Pc (by 2.4 +/- 0.5 mmHg) causing fluid absorption. Rart was unchanged, indicating impaired autoregulation. Increased PV had no haemodynamic effects when PV < Ptissue due to a gradual decrease in Rorifice towards zero when PV reached Ptissue. At PV > Ptissue blood flow and Pc increased gradually, causing fluid filtration.

   CONCLUSIONS: Tissue volume is increased by raised and decreased by lowered PA, the latter may be of use to decrease ICP in the injured brain. The results indicate that PEEP or head elevation will not influence ICP from the venous side if CVP < ICP. Finally, the "vascular waterfall phenomenon" was rejected as Rorifice is a normal variable fluid resistance.

Abstract
  Endotracheal suctioning (ETS) is a conventional nursing intervention used to decrease pulmonary complications in the critically ill patient. ETS provides a particular dilemma for the head-injured patient because it increases intracranial pressure and may put the patient at increased risk for intracranial hypertension and cerebral ischemia. Research in endotracheal suctioning targets understanding the ETS response in the severely head-injured patient. This article reviews the major research focused on suctioning the head-injured patient. The guidelines for practice based on this research include preoxygenating patients prior to suctioning, limiting suction duration to 10 seconds, limiting suction passes to 1-2 per procedure, using hyperventilation with caution, not rotating the head, keeping negative suction pressure under 120 mm Hg, and not using suction catheters with outer to inner diameter ratios greater than .50.

Abstract
  The over-drainage of CSF after shunt implantation, particularly when the patient is in the vertical posture, is well documented. Problems associated with it are negative pressure syndrome (postural headache and postural irritability), abnormal skull size, craniosynostosis and subdural haematoma. The pressure gradient in the vertical position between the cranial cavity and the right atrium is 15 to 20 cm of water and between the cranial and peritoneal cavity it is 25 to 32 cm of water and both these are much higher than those needed for the optimum functioning of a conventional shunt. The need, therefore, has been for a self-regulating device that can adjust itself to any change of posture from horizontal to vertical and vice versa and regulate the flow of CSF from the cranial cavity. "Z" Flow hydrocephalus shunt system has this in-built self-regulating mechanism to prevent over drainage of CSF and the resultant abnormal low pressure in the cranial cavity. The rationale behind the functioning of "Z" Flow hydrocephalus shunt system has been discussed, its design has been described and illustrated and the results of pressure monitoring after Z Flow shunt implantation in five adult patients have been detailed. As the opening pressures of the "Z" Flow shunt system are 15-29 cm of water, it has been found to prevent over-drainage of CSF and maintain intraventricular pressure within normal limits.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of intermittent pneumatic leg compression on intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure in brain-injured patients.

   DESIGN: Prospective, sequential patient study.

   SETTING: Surgical/trauma ICU of a community hospital providing regional trauma care.

   PATIENTS: Twenty-four adult, brain-injured patients (mean Glasgow Coma Scale score = 6) who required hemodynamic and intracranial pressure monitoring.

   INTERVENTIONS: Placement of intermittent sequential pneumatic leg compression devices for prevention of venous thrombosis.

   MEASUREMENTS: Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, central venous pressure, and intracranial pressure were measured at baseline, and at 0, 10, 20, and 30 mins of intermittent pneumatic leg compression. Cerebral perfusion pressure was calculated as the difference between MAP and intracranial pressure.

   RESULTS: No significant changes in MAP, central venous pressure, or intracranial pressure occurred during the study interval. Calculated cerebral perfusion pressure remained unchanged. A total of 23 of 24 study patients had intracranial pressure controlled by hyperventilation or pharmacologic measures within the normal range at the time of study.

   CONCLUSION: Intermittent pneumatic leg compression results in no significant changes in intracranial pressure or cerebral perfusion pressure in stable, brain-injured patients who have intracranial pressure controlled by medical means.

Abstract
  Intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Hemorrhagic hypovolemia commonly coexists with head injury in this population of patients. Therapy directed at correcting hypovolemic shock includes vigorous volume expansion with crystalloid solutions. It is hypothesized that, following traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular dysfunction results in rapid loss of brain compliance, resulting in increased sensitivity to cerebrovascular venous pressure. Increased central venous pressure (CVP) occurring with vigorous crystalloid resuscitation may therefore contribute to the loss of brain compliance and the development of intracranial hypertension. The authors tested this hypothesis in miniature swine subjected to traumatic brain injury, hemorrhage, and resuscitation. Elevated CVP following resuscitation from hemorrhage to a high CVP significantly worsened intracranial hypertension in animals with concurrent traumatic brain injury, as compared to animals subjected to traumatic brain injury alone (mean +/- standard error of the mean: 33.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 20.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, p < 0.05) or to animals subjected to the combination of traumatic brain injury, hemorrhage, and resuscitation to a low CVP (33.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 24.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, p < 0.05). These data support the hypothesis that reduction in brain compliance can occur secondary to elevation of CVP following resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock. This may worsen intracranial hypertension in patients with traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic shock.

Abstract
  To study the role of extravascular intracranial pressure (ICP) in the genesis of intracranial hemorrhage in the beagle puppy, we measured ICP in animals on the day of birth, untreated 3-day-old controls, and 3-day-old animals treated from birth with prolactin. Baseline ICP varied substantially in all 3 groups. Only 8% of this variability was attributable to variability in mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure. ICP was lower in the 3-day-old controls, animals at high risk for intracranial hemorrhage after a hypovolemic/hypotensive insult followed by rapid volume expansion, than in the other groups which are at lower risk. Administration of a hyperosmolar insult, intraperitoneal glycerol, to animals whose ICP was relatively high promptly lowered ICP. After this treatment, the risk of intracranial hemorrhage was markedly increased in these previously low-risk groups. We conclude that the normal neonatal decrease in brain water content and the consequent fall in ICP substantially increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in the beagle puppy, a model which appears similar in pathophysiology to hemorrhage in the preterm human infant.

Abstract
  Cerebral sinus-vein thrombosis may lead to severe hemodynamic changes, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and brain edema. It is supposed that progression of the thrombus from the sinus into bridging and cortical veins plays a key role in the development of these pathophysiological changes, but this hypothesis lacks experimental proof. The aim of this study, using a novel animal model of sinus-vein thrombosis, was to evaluate the effects of a standardized occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus and its bridging and cortical veins on hemodynamic alterations, on brain water content, and on ICP in domestic pigs. In 10 animals, the middle third of the superior sagittal sinus was occluded with a catheter-guided balloon. Five of these pigs received an additional injection of 1 ml fibrin glue into the superior sagittal sinus anterior to the inflated balloon, leading to an obstruction of bridging and cortical veins. In five control animals the balloon was inserted but not inflated. Five pigs underwent cerebral angiography. Four hours after occlusion, the brains were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and coronal slices were examined for Evans blue dye extravasation, regional water content, and histological changes. Occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus alone did not affect ICP or cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The additional injection of fibrin glue caused an obstruction of cortical and bridging veins as well as severe increases in mean (+/- standard deviation) ICP to 49.4 +/- 14.3 mm Hg, compared with 8.3 +/- 4.5 mm Hg in sham-treated controls and 7.1 +/- 3.9 mm Hg in animals with occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus alone. There was also a steep fall in the mean CPP to 34.2 +/- 19.6 mm Hg compared with 96.4 +/- 13.8 mm Hg in the control group. White-matter water content anterior to the occlusion site was elevated to 81.9 +/- 3.7 gm/100 gm frozen weight in the fibrin group as compared to 70.7 +/- 2.2 gm/100 gm in controls. Posterior to the occlusion site, water content did not differ among the three groups. Angiography demonstrated collateral flow via cortical and bridging veins in animals with occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus alone. Additional fibrin glue obstructed these collateral vessels. The data suggest a multistep process of pathophysiological alterations in patients with sinus-vein thrombosis and may explain why these patients present with a wide variety of symptoms: minor neurological deficits or headache might indicate thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and/or its bridging veins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Abstract
  11 cases of cerebral venous thrombosis in adults are reported. Main clinical signs are: intracranial hypertension (headache, nausea, papilledema in 7 cases, loss of consciousness in 6 cases, neurological deficit in 6 cases, seizure in 4 cases. 1 patient is dead, who did not receive heparin treatment. Delay before diagnosis is between 2 and 20 days, and is shortened when arteriography or MRI are available and prescribed. At least one (or several) CT examination was performed in 10 patients. Direct signs of thrombosis are uneasily detected without contrast injection, seen here in 4 cases. Empty delta sign is observed in 7 patients, lately in 4 cases, and once only afterwards. Cerebral infarction is visualized in 7 cases over 10. Its features frequently seem evocative for cerebral venous thrombosis: triangularin 4 cases or nodular shape in 3 cases with hemorragic infarct in 7 cases, with bilateral topography in 6 cases, in frontal or central areas in 7 cases. 6 patients had a MRI examination. All cerebral infarctions appeared haemorragical, even at early stages. During subacute period, venous thrombosis is constantly and easily detected by the mean of methemoglobin high signal intensity on T1 weighted images. The prediagnosis delay is short, without necessity of arteriography. MRI should take the place of CT and arteriography in investigation of a clinically suspected cerebral venous thrombosis.

Abstract
  Dural sinus hypertension from cerebral venous outflow impairment is a cause of pseudotumor cerebri. The authors documented six such patients: two with unilateral neck dissection, one with surgical ligation of the dominant sigmoid sinus, two with thrombosed central intravenous catheterization, and one with dural sinus thrombosis. The site of cerebral venous outflow obstruction was variable and identified in three patients with computed tomography, conventional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and/or angiography. Magnetic resonance angiography used in two patients characterized the venous flow pattern and identified the site of obstruction, confirming magnetic resonance angiography as an effective noninvasive blood flow technique in diagnosing and following these patients. Three patients were treated successfully with medical therapy and one patient with optic nerve fenestration. The two patients with thrombosed central venous catheters had serious systemic illnesses and suffered permanent visual loss.

Abstract
  Twenty-five patients (10 neonates, 15 children) with cerebral venous thromboses diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography over a 10-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Two groups were analyzed separately because of their differing modes of presentation and outcome. Eighty percent of neonates presented with seizures and the outcomes were unfavorable in more than 50%. Thrombosis usually was associated with an acute systemic illness, such as shock or dehydration. In comparison, headache was the most common mode of presentation in the older children (excluding infants) and their outcomes generally were favorable. Thrombosis in this group usually occurred in the setting of a hypercoagulable state or an infectious process. In both groups, global or focal neurologic findings on initial examination unrelated to increased intracranial pressure correlated with the presence of an infarction on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Infants and children with infarction due to a deep venous thrombosis often had persistent neurologic disability at subsequent examination. No sequelae were observed in those children and neonates only with thrombosis or with superficial venous infarction. Treatment for both groups was conservative. No patient was anticoagulated specifically for the thrombosis. The good outcomes in most patients suggest that acute anticoagulation may not be indicated.

Abstract
  We tested the hypothesis that intracranial pressures and cerebral perfusion pressure in the newborn are more seriously affected by increasing airway pressure during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) than during conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). Mean airway pressure was acutely elevated in stepwise fashion to 25 cm H2O in six anesthetized, paralyzed newborn lambs. Pressure (mean +/- SE) increased similarly during HFOV and CMV in the jugular vein (7 +/- 1 and 8 +/- 1 cm H2O, respectively), the sagittal sinus (6 +/- 1 and 7 +/- 1 cm H2O), and the cerebrospinal fluid of the lateral ventricle (4 +/- 1 and 6 +/- 1 cm H2O). Decreases in arterial blood pressure (-13 +/- 2 and -10 +/- 2 cm H2O) and cerebral perfusion pressure (-17 +/- 2 and -16 +/- 2 cm H2O) were also similar during HFOV and CMV. Intracranial pressure-volume curves were generated by incrementing cerebrospinal fluid volume in eight lambs. Curves generated during HFOV and CMV were similar, reflecting a similar intracranial compliance during the two ventilatory modes. These data indicate that intracranial compliance and the effects of increasing airway pressure upon intracranial pressures are not significantly different between HFOV and CMV.

Abstract
  Hypertension-hypervolemia therapy (HHT) is widely employed for treatment against vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A few investigations have been reported to establish the fact that HHT results in a high incidence of congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema as well as deterioration of brain edema. From the point of view that the cerebral circulation is not independent of the systemic circulation, the authors investigated the effect of HHT on the systemic circulation of patients with SAH. In 72 patients, intracranial pressure (ICP), pulmonary catheter wedge pressure (PCWP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PA), central venous pressure (CVP), arterial pressure (AP), cardiac index (CI), arterial blood gas (ABGS), electrocardiogram (ECG), serum and urine electrolytes were monitored postoperatively. Furthermore, among these patients, the flow (Flow), volume (Volume) and velocity (Velocity) of the cortical vessels were monitored by means of a Laser Doppler in 25 patients. A cisternal or spinal drain was placed in all of the patients. Elevation of PCWP and CVP and Flow were observed when 300ml of 10% glycerol was administered within a period of 30 minutes, whereas administration of the same dose of glycerol over a period of 60 or 120 minutes caused no significant changes on these parameters. Elevation of PCWP and CVP and decrease of CI and Flow, occasionally associated with premature ventricular contraction (PVC), were observed in some patients when 100ml of 25% albumin was administered. However, administration of the same dose of albumin over a period of 120 or 240 minutes did not cause deterioration of the cardiac function. These facts could be explained by Guyton's law in which massive transfusion causes cardiac dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract
  Isotonic, hypotonic, or hypertonic saline was infused in anesthetized rabbits in order to test the effects of osmolality in cerebral vessels on lymph flow. The jugular lymph trunk was cannulated by PE tubing in a headward direction. Either a hypo-(100 mosmol), iso-(310 mosmol), or hypertonic (605 mosmol) NaCl solution was infused into the internal carotid artery (ICA) or the right lateral ventricle (RIV). Lymph was continuously collected at slight negative pressure, and measured over a 90 min preinfusion period, as well as during saline infusion and intermittent recovery periods. Mean peak flow rates for the first 30 min infusion of hypertonic saline via ICA and RLV were 5.1 +/- 1.2 and 6.7 +/- 1.6 microliters/min, respectively, or a significant increase of 38% and 40% over those of isotonic saline (3.7 +/- 0.9 microliters/min via ICA; 4.8 +/- 1.0 microliters/min via RLV). Conversely, for hypotonic saline, lymph flow rates were significantly reduced by 19% (2.9 +/- 0.6 microliters/min) and 23% (3.7 +/- 0.7 microliters/min) for the first 30 min infusion via ICA and RLV, respectively. Increases in arterial and intracranial pressures, as well as an enhancement of respiratory movements following hypertonic saline infusion, augmented lymph formation. The results suggest that the observed changes in jugular lymph flow following saline infusion can be correlated to the resulting increase in intracranial pressure and respiratory movements, and changes in the osmolality and blood pressure of cerebral vessels.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation causes retinal hemorrhages in piglets.

   DESIGN: Nonrandomized observations.

   SETTING: Animal physiology laboratory.

   PARTICIPANTS: Six 3.5- to 4.5-kg piglets.

   INTERVENTIONS: Fifty minutes of conventional, closed chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

   MEASUREMENTS/MAIN RESULTS: Intrathoracic venous pressure (right atrium) and intracranial venous pressure (sagittal sinus) were directly measured. At 5 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the mean (+/- SEM) sagittal sinus pressure was 41 +/- 8 mm Hg and the mean right atrial pressure was 58 +/- 9 mm Hg. The pressures were sustained throughout the 50 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. At autopsy, there was no gross or microscopic evidence of retinal hemorrhages.

   CONCLUSION: These results support the conclusion that cardiopulmonary resuscitation does not cause retinal hemorrhages.

Abstract
  Pipecurium bromide, a new non-depolarizing myorelaxant, was administered intravenously, at a dose of 0.06 mg/kg, to 10 patients suffering from expansive endocranial lesions, who had been anesthetised to undergo neurosurgery. The following parameters were recorded simultaneously, before and after drug administration: intracranial pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, heart rate and end tidal CO2. No statistically significant changes in the above parameters were observed following the administration of the myorelaxant; these observations, which were considered together with the long duration of action, confirm that pipecurium bromide is a valuable tool in anesthesia for neurosurgery.

Abstract
  Aneurysms of the vein of Galen are very rare vascular anomalies found mainly in newborns and infants. In the years 1982-1989 five children with these aneurysms were treated. Their age was from 6 weeks to 16 months, all were males. The diagnosis was based on computed tomography (initial examination) and cerebral angiography. Two cases with hydrocephalus were treated with valves. The main procedure was clipping of supplying vessels. One child died during diagnostic procedures. The results in four operated on patients are good. [References: 5]

Abstract
  Brain death is associated with loss of hypothalamic, pituitary and brain stem function resulting in apnea, bradycardia and hypotension, poikilothermia, and diabetes insipidus. In order to preserve body functions mechanical ventilation is continued with the aim to maintain an arterial partial pressure of oxygen of more than 100 mmHg. Previous fluid restrictions and the application of diuretics during the treatment of high intracranial pressure frequently result in dehydration. Progressive vasodilation may induce severe hypotension and fluid replacement with cristalloids and if necessary colloids may be called for until the central venous pressure reaches 10 cm H2O. Continuous substitution of potassium and the use of hypotonic solutions such as glucose 5% may avoid hypokalaemia and hypernatraemia, respectively. Inotropic support with dopamine (5-10 micrograms/kg.min) or adrenaline (0.01-0.1 micrograms/kg.min) may be needed to maintain normal mean arterial blood pressure (65 mmHg). Polyuria (5000 ml/24 h) can be treated by continuous intravenous infusion of antidiuretic hormone (0.5-2-10 U/h). Hypothermia must be prevented by warming all fluids (37 degrees C) and covering the patient with heat saving blankets.

Abstract
  Seven cases of meningiomas implanted on the medial portion of the free edge of the tentorium are reported. The denomination "meningiomas of the apex of the tentorial incisura" is proposed. In 4 patients, the clinical presentation was that of an intracranial hypertension without signs of compression of the quadrigeminal plate involvement. In the other 3 patients, the initial symptoms were those of the triad of the adult chronic hydrocephalus (N.P.H.) syndrome. Angiographic evaluation provides useful informations on the arterial supply (which is mainly from the tentorial branches of the internal carotid arteries and occasionally from the middle meningeal arteries) and the relationships of the tumor with the deep venous system. C.T. and M.R.I. facilitate earlier diagnosis and better demonstration of implantation and extension of the tumor, which the selection of a surgical approach is based upon. Four patients have undergone an occipital supratentorial approach and 2 a supra-cerebellar infra-tentorial approach. The meningioma was totally removed in 5 patients, sub-totally in 1 to avoid bilateral lesions of the visual pathways and cortical areas. The 7th patient was treated by C.S.F. shunt alone. No operative mortality occurred. The follow-up is averaging 18 months: 4 patients are symptom-free, 3 exhibit minor sequelae (epilepsy: 1, visual field defects: 2, memory impairement: 2). Six patients of the series have resumed their previous activities. Discussion is focused on the difficulties of surgical removal of this particular type of tentorial meningioma, resulting from volume, implantation and relationships of the tumor with the deep veins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [References: 47]

Abstract
  We addressed the impact on intracranial pressure (ICP) of posthemorrhage fluid resuscitation with a protocol in which additional fluid was infused to maintain a stable cardiac output after an initial bolus of fluid was infused. Anesthetized, mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs (n = 27) underwent a 30-minute interval of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure = 55 mm Hg) during which inflation of a subdural balloon maintained ICP at 15 mm Hg. After shock, animals were resuscitated with one of four randomly assigned fluids: (1) slightly hypotonic crystalloid (Na+, 125 mEq.L-1; designated Na-125); (2) hypertonic crystalloid (Na+, 250 mEq.L-1; designated Na-250); (3) slightly hypotonic crystalloid plus 10% pentastarch (Na-125P); or (4) hypertonic crystalloid plus 10% pentastarch (Na-250P). Supplemental fluid was administered as needed to maintain cardiac output comparable to baseline values. ICP increased progressively in all fluid groups during resuscitation. Cerebral blood flow, measured by the cerebral venous outflow method, increased immediately after resuscitation and then declined steadily over time in all groups. Fluids containing pentastarch maintained hemodynamic stability with minimal supplementation throughout most of the postresuscitation period, compared with crystalloid alone, which required substantial additional volume. If decreased intracranial compliance and hemorrhage are combined, ongoing resuscitation is associated with significantly increased ICP and significantly decreased cerebral blood flow, independent of the tonicity and oncotic pressure of the infused fluid.

Abstract
  We report a series of eight cases that show a close resemblance to, but are not identical with, pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) as normally defined. The majority of these cases are characterized by raised intracranial pressure without ventriculomegaly. They include two cases of cranial venous outflow obstruction in which clinical or radiologic abnormalities precluded the diagnosis of PTC proper (cases 1 and 2); one case of chronic meningitis in which an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition precluded the diagnosis of PTC (case 3); two cases without either papilledema or a measured increase of CSF pressure, which in other respects, particularly in response to treatment, resembled PTC (cases 4 and 5); and three cases of what is thought to represent an infantile form of PTC (cases 6 through 8). The purpose of the analysis of these cases is twofold. First, it is argued that these cases throw light on the mechanism of PTC itself, supporting a concept of a disturbance of CSF circulation in this condition, and that they are themselves illuminated by considerations of typical PTC. Second, the cases are used to frame a proposed classification of the pseudotumor syndrome aimed at broadening the diagnostic criteria applied currently to PTC. It is suggested that the pseudotumor syndrome has a single underlying mechanism (disturbed CSF circulation) and that recognition of this mechanism not only clarifies the pathophysiologic processes of PTC but also has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

Abstract
  We compared canine systemic and cerebral hemodynamics after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock with 4 mL/kg (a volume approximating 12% of shed blood volume) of 7.2% saline (HS; 1233 mEq/L sodium), 20% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) in 0.8% saline, or a combination fluid consisting of 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 7.2% saline (HS/HES). Eighteen endotracheally intubated mongrel dogs (18-24 kg) were ventilated to maintain normocarbia with 0.5% halothane in nitrous oxide and oxygen (60:40). After a 30-min period of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial blood pressure = 40 mm Hg), extending from time T0 to T30, animals received one of three randomly assigned intravenous resuscitation fluids: HS, HES, or HS/HES. Data were collected at baseline, at the beginning and end of the shock period (T0 and T30), immediately after fluid infusion (T35), and at 60-min intervals for 2 h (T95, T155). After resuscitation, mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output increased similarly in all groups, but failed to return to baseline. Intracranial pressure decreased during shock and increased slightly, immediately after resuscitation in all groups. During shock, cerebral blood flow (cerebral venous outflow method) declined in all groups. After resuscitation, cerebral blood flow increased, exceeding baseline in the HS and HS/HES groups but remaining low in the HES group (P less than 0.05 HS vs HES at T35). We conclude that small-volume resuscitation (4 mL/kg) with HS, HS/HES, or HES does not effectively restore or sustain systemic hemodynamics in hemorrhaged dogs. In dogs without intracranial pathology, the effects on cerebral hemodynamics are also comparable, except for transiently greater cerebral blood flow in the HS group in comparison with the HES group.

Abstract
  A 10-month-old child with achondroplasia with progressive head enlargement, ventriculomegaly, and wide subarachnoid spaces over the hemispheres was referred for evaluation. A steady-state lumbar infusion test revealed increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow resistance (14 mm Hg/ml/min), and intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated bilateral venous outflow obstruction due to stenosis of the jugular foramen. Surgical decompression by opening the right jugular foramen relieved the clinical signs of intracranial hypertension. During the following year, the patient's head enlargement was moderate with relative normalization of size. Repeat DSA demonstrated improved venous runoff on the right side, and a steady-state lumbar infusion test demonstrated reduced CSF outflow resistance (10 mm Hg/ml/min). Venous decompression is causal therapy and may prove to be preferable to shunting in children with hydrocephalus and bilateral stenosis of the jugular foramen.

Abstract
  The effects of airway care procedures on intracranial dynamics were studied in 12 patients with intracranial lesions. The patients had controlled ventilation and were treated according to a standardized protocol with endotracheal suction and bag squeezing. Intracranial, arterial blood and airway pressures were recorded and cerebral perfusion pressure was calculated. Both methods used for airway care elicited marked changes in intracranial, arterial blood and cerebral perfusion pressures during the treatment session. However, within 1 min after termination of the procedure the different pressure levels returned to pretreatment values except for the intracranial and arterial blood pressure in endotracheal suction. Cerebral perfusion pressure, calculated at different time intervals: 1, 5 and 15 min after the treatment, showed only minor deviations from values before treatment. The mean values varied from 70 to 90 mmHg (9.3 to 12.0 kPa) and the lower limit of the 99% confidence interval of the means was never below 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa). At times complementary administration of sedatives during endotracheal suction was found to induce a drop in arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. In conclusion, patients with severe brain injuries treated on mechanical ventilation are exposed to equal risks when using bag squeezing for airway care as when using traditional endotracheal suction. Regardless of the method used, patients should be adequately sedated before starting the procedure in order to reduce the risk of adverse effects.

Abstract
  This article describes the clinical course, including measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP), radiological findings, and treatment, of a gravely ill patient with extensive thrombosis involving the superior sagittal and both transverse sinuses, and the galenic venous system. When "conventional" therapy including anticoagulants and neuro-intensive care failed to reverse the progressive neurological deterioration or to control the ICP, the condition was approached surgically and thrombotic material was removed from the dural sinuses without much difficulty. The effect on the ICP was dramatic, although short-lived. A second operation, combined with local infusion of streptokinase in the sagittal sinus, had a permanent effect as judged from the ICP measurements, radiological findings, and clinical improvement. The combination of direct operative removal of thrombotic material and local infusion of a thrombolytic agent (streptokinase) proved to be an effective treatment of severe dural sinus thrombosis in this patient.

Abstract
  In a series of 23 consecutive patients under 3 years old with VGAVM managed in Bicetre from 1985 to 1990, 19 have been angiographically explored and 16/19 embolized (35 total procedures). Anaesthetic management must be adapted to the consequences of this disease: heart failure in newborns, intracranial hypertension in infants and the technical constraints of anaesthesiology in infants during neuroradiological explorations. Our results are satisfactory when compared to the classical bad prognosis of the disease: 90% of all the heart failures were ameliorated or cured; 10 infants are anatomically cured. The technical morbidity and mortality in embolized patients is nil. No perfusion breakthrough phenomena was observed in this series.

Abstract
  A unique case of spontaneous regression of giant arteriovenous fistulae during infancy is described in this report. A female infant, the product of normal labor and delivery, demonstrated severe ventriculomegaly and an intracranial hemorrhage at birth. Cerebral angiography at 5 days of age revealed several large fistulae fed by the anterior and middle cerebral arteries draining into the deep venous system through a dilated internal cerebral vein and ectatic vein of Galen. Two days following the angiogram, a second intracranial hemorrhage occurred. Active hydrocephalus developed over the next 6 months and was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting. When the child was 8 months of age, angiography failed to demonstrate the fistulae. It was postulated that pressure effects from the intracranial hematoma and long-standing intracranial hypertension as well as stenosis in the anomalous venous outflow resulted in vascular stasis, venous thrombosis, and selective arterial occlusion. Hydrocephalus was a result of the compression of the intraventricular foramina by dilated embryonic vessels. This anomaly, predominantly involving the anterior circulation, may be homologous to the vein of Galen aneurysm in the posterior circulation. [References: 18]

Abstract
  Only 6 patients with intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations have been reported. We report 6 additional patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic during the past 10 years. The average age was 28 years (range, 19-44 years); 4 were women. Symptoms and signs included papilledema (6 patients), headache (6), transient nonepileptic focal symptoms (4), visual obscurations (3), ipsilateral carotid or ocular bruits (3), abnormal visual fields (3), focal seizures (2), and progressive visual loss (1). Enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the malformations in all 6 patients. The malformations were large, supplied by the branches of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, with the posterior cerebral artery contributing in 3 patients, and all drained into the superior sagittal sinus. Associated venous obstruction was seen in 2 patients. Four patients underwent excision of the arteriovenous malformation, with resolution of papilledema in all 4. Measurements of cortical arterial and venous pressures during surgery in 3 patients showed decreased feeding artery pressures and elevated draining vein pressures, which normalized after removal of the malformation. Treatment in the 2 remaining patients consisted of medical therapy (acetazolamide, furosemide, steroids) alone in 1 patient, and in conjunction with proton beam radiation in the other. Papilledema resolved in the former patient, but the patient receiving proton beam radiation still had papilledema 2 years later. Intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations occurs in young patients with high flow malformations that drain into the superior sagittal sinus, and is likely the result of increased cortical venous and superior sagittal sinus pressure. Excision of the malformation effectively reduces the intracranial pressure. [References: 18]

Abstract
  Experimental cryogenic brain oedema was created in albino rabbits, and intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), EEG, blood pressure, central venous pressure, were subsequently studied at a constant PaCO2. Upon completion the brain water content of the gray and white matter was analyzed by gravimetry. The findings were compared to controls and sham-operated. Two subsets of elevated ICP following cryogenic injury were identified: one with a mean of 6.2 +/- 3.3 torr (n = 7) and the other of 19.3 +/- 9 (n = 5) (p less than 0.005). Both these subsets had similar white and gray matter gravimetry values indicating that the magnitude of cerebral oedema was comparable and could not explain the difference in ICP. There was however a significant difference in the CBF of the left hemisphere between these subsets, with Subset A at 49.1 +/- 9 ml/100 g/min and Subset B with 70 +/- 9.1 (p less than 0.001). We conclude that the ICP elevation in the cryogenic oedema model may be due to not only increased brain water of the injured hemisphere, but also to increased cerebral blood volume due to increased CBF.

Abstract
  The effect of inspiration and expiration on the systolic slope of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulse wave has been studied in 83 shunted and non-shunted patients undergoing diagnostic tests for suspected hydrocephalus. A ratio of the systolic CSF pulse slope on inspiration to the same in expiration (I/E ratio or index) has proved statistically valid in identifying non-hydrocephalic patients from hydrocephalic patients and in separating hydrocephalic patients into arrested, communicating and aqueductal stenosis hydrocephalus. The I/E ratio depends on the comparative damping effect of intracranial venous venting on the systolic CSF pulse slope during inspiration (I) when venous volume is evacuated from the cranium by negative mediastinal pressure, and during expiration (E) when cranial venous volume flow to heart is minimal due to positive mediastinal pressure. The low cranial venous outflow on expiration produces little effect on the normal damping of the systolic CSF pulse slope. The high venous outflow on inspiration produces a loss of damping, causing a high systolic CSF pulse slope. Therefore, exhausted cranial venous volume, or exhausted intracranial compliance, produces an I/E ratio approaching 1.0, whereas a normal I/E ratio is between 2.0 and 3.0. The I/E ratio can presumably be used to assess intracranial compliance changes occurring before the dangerous late intracranial pressure (ICP) upward surge related to the volume-pressure curve in all clinical problems of increasing ICP. The I/E ratio may be used likewise to assess the urgency of treatment for any hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure problem, i.e. the closer to unity the greater the urgency.

Abstract
  Data concerning venous anatomy, interstitial fluid pressure and cerebral blood flow indicate that obstruction of cerebral venous outflow (as a whole or involving the deep venous system alone) is the essential cause of hydrocephalus. Choroidal and ventricular veins both belong to the deep system. Choroidal venous pressure determines cerebrospinal fluid pressure; pressure in the ventricular veins determines interstitial fluid pressure in the paraventricular white matter. A decrease in deep cerebral blood flow causes paraventricular atrophy. CSFP is higher than interstitial fluid pressure. normally and in venous obstruction. Thus, CSFP prevents venocongestive edema (but not inflammatory edema) of the brain. Collateral venous pathways are described. Venous obstruction causes hydrocephalus only when it leads to insufficient blood flow. Cerebrospinal fluid shunting causes increased CBF as essential therapeutic effect in hydrocephalus, but also causes venocongestive brain edema, which explains the decrease in ventricle size and the side effects of shunting.

Abstract
  CPP reflects perfusion problems related to increased ICP or inadequate MAP. CPP is a most helpful and practical management tool. The relationship of CBF and CPP depends on cerebral vascular resistance (flow equals pressure divided by resistance). At present, we do not have a practical method to measure vascular resistance or CBV. A close relationship between an increase in CBV and increase in ICP exists. However, the relationship between CBF and ICP is more complex. Whereas CBV is strongly dependent on vasodilation and venous return, CBF is influenced by CPP, vascular resistance, viscosity changes, and focally or diffusely increased ICP. For instance, in hypotensive shock one finds a low CBF with an elevated CBV (and ICP) from vasodilation related to hypercapnia, anoxia, or acidosis. Nevertheless, about two thirds of patients with increased ICP after head injury have increased CBF (hyperemia) and increased CBV. This frequent hyperemia is one rationale for the wide usage of hyperventilation to treat increased ICP. It must be recognized that a group of patients may have ischemia caused by excessive hyperventilation therapy for increased ICP. The PaCO2 must not be allowed to decrease to 20 mmHg or lower, but in some patients a PaCO2 level of 21 to 25 may be predisposing to ischemia. Strong consideration is thus given to monitoring CBF and cerebral oxygen metabolism (arteriovenous oxygen content difference [AVDO2], CMRO2) in states of coma and increased ICP. In such patients, continuous infusion of mannitol may result in improved CBF, and hyperventilation therapy can be less aggressive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [References: 48]

Abstract
  The effects of nitrous oxide (N2O) on cerebral blood flow and metabolism, intracranial pressure (ICP), the electroencephalogram etc. has been well described, at least when N2O is used alone. However, during neurosurgical procedures, N2O is almost always given in combination with either volatile or intravenous agents, and generally after the institution of some degree of hypocarbia. Unfortunately, the modifying influence of such interventions are not well known, and, therefore, the cerebral effects of 70% N2O were studied in rabbits anesthetized with either 1 MAC halothane or isoflurane, or with a fentanyl/pentobarbital combination, during both normocarbia (PaCO2 approximately 40 mm Hg) and hypocarbia (PaCO2 approximately 20 mm Hg). Cortical cerebral blood flow (CBFc) and sagittal sinus blood flow (CBFss--as an index of "global" forebrain flow) were measured using the hydrogen clearance method. Cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) was calculated, and intracranial pressure (ICP), central venous pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and the EEG were also recorded. CBFc during normocarbic halothane, isoflurane, and fentanyl-pentobarbital anesthesia was 69 +/- 23, 41 +/- 16, 53 +/- 26 ml.100g-1.min-1 (mean +/- SD) respectively, with a significant difference between halothane and isoflurane. The addition of 70% N2O to all three anesthetics significantly increased CBFc by 32%, 34% and 36% respectively during normocarbia and by 47%, 65% and 27% during hypocarbia. A similar pattern was seen for CBFss. There were no significant differences in the response to N2O based either on anesthetic or PaCO2, except that the increase in CBFss produced by N2O during normocarbic fentanyl-pentobarbital anesthesia (10%) was less than that noted during normocarbic halothane anesthesia (39%).

Abstract
  We examined and managed two patients with posterior fossa dural arteriovenous malformations (DAVMs) and papilledema. Both DAVMs had venous drainage into the transverse, straight, and sigmoid dural venous sinuses. The mechanism of papilledema in the first case was presumed venous hypertension resulting in impaired cerebrospinal fluid absorption, as the malformation drained into the single transverse sinus. This was cured by selective arterial embolization of the causative DAVM. The second patient had venous sinus thrombosis that impaired venous drainage despite embolization. A lumboperitoneal shunt was necessary to treat the elevated intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  A total of 76 splenectomized dogs were entered in a study of the value and effects of isovolemic hemodilution. Of these, seven were not included in the analysis because of technical errors. Of the remaining 69 dogs, 35 were treated with hemodilution; 28 were subjected to a 6-hour period of temporary occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery and the proximal middle cerebral artery, and seven underwent a sham operation only, with arterial manipulation but no occlusion. The other 34 dogs were not subjected to hemodilution; 26 of these underwent temporary arterial occlusion and eight had a sham operation only. In each group the animals were about equally divided into 1) an acute protocol with regional cerebral blood flow measurements by a radioactive microsphere technique and sacrifice at the end of the acute experiment, and 2) a chronic protocol with survival for 1 week to permit daily neurological assessment and final histopathological examination but without blood flow measurements. Isovolemic hemodilution was performed about 1 hour after the arterial occlusion or sham operation and was accomplished by phlebotomy and infusions of low molecular weight dextran to bring the hematocrit to a level of 30% to 32%. This treatment resulted in a very significant reduction in viscosity and fibrinogen levels. The decrease in hematocrit lasted throughout the week in the animals in the chronic protocol. The decrease in viscosity correlated almost linearly with the decrease in hematocrit. There was a slight decrease in systemic arterial pressure with hemodilution but there were no significant changes in central venous pressure or in pulmonary arterial or wedge pressure. There was a slight decrease in cardiac index in both the hemodilution and control groups, which may have been due to the effects of barbiturate anesthesia. There was a slight increase in the measured blood volume in both groups, which was probably artifactual and related to the method of calculation. Intracranial pressure increased significantly with time in all animals subjected to arterial occlusion, but this increase was less severe in the hemodilution group. There was no significant change in intracranial pressure in sham-operated animals, whether hemodiluted or not. The results of cerebral blood flow measurements, assessment of neurological conditions, and measurement of infarct size are given in Part 2 of this report.

Abstract
  A 51-year-old man with cerebellar signs and raised intracranial pressure had negative indirect and serological tests for cysticercosis. During operation cysticerci were removed from the cisterna magna, fourth ventricle and aqueduct. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of cysticercosis. After operation the condition of the patient deteriorated consciousness disturbances, involuntary movements of the left upper extremity and paraparesis appeared. Only after treatment with Praziquantel with simultaneous administration of oedema-reducing agents nearly complete regression of neurological manifestations was achieved.

Abstract
  A computerized monitoring and analyzing system for neurosurgical intensive care has been developed. The system continuously monitors the function of the central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Correlation between such parameters can be analyzed automatically. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were monitored as parameters for CNS function and condition. The cardiovascular and respiratory systems were monitored by heart rate, systemic blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, respiratory rate, and expiratory O2 and CO2 pressures. Body temperature was also monitored continuously. Sequential changes of those parameters were displayed on time-dependent trend graphs, and correlations between each parameter were automatically analyzed by linear regression equations. The clinical applicability of the system was demonstrated in the postoperative treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured intracranial aneurysm. In such a case, EEG slowing was observed in this system prior to clinical deterioration, and had a correlation with a decrease of pulmonary arterial pressure. Thus, the necessity for restoration of intravascular volume was realized before clinical deterioration progressed.

Abstract
  In some cases of dural arteriovenous malformations (dural AVMs) of the transverse-sigmoid sinuses, the presence of an occlusion or hypoplasia on the sinus contralateral to the affected side may significantly contribute to the development of intracranial hypertension. For these cases, closure of AV shunts or removal of the affected sinus may not be sufficient to improve intracranial hypertension. We encountered 2 cases of intracranial hypertension caused by dural AVMs at the transverse-sigmoid sinuses associated with disturbance of venous outflow contralateral to the lesion. Reconstruction of venous outflow using a saphenous vein graft was performed between the transverse sinus and the subclavian or external jugular vein after the dural AVMs were partially occluded by catheter embolization. Intracranial hypertension was relieved in both cases. In one case dural AVM was obstructed by both embolization and radical surgery after the bypass was confirmed unobstructed several weeks later. The bypass remained patent at the follow-up 4 months later. In the other case, patency of the bypass lasted only for approximately 1 month. In both cases clinical improvements were not remarkable. It is considered that the presence of AV shunt in the case of dural AVM may facilitate the patency of a graft placed between the venous systems. Reconstruction of the venous outflow may deserve further trial for the treatment of intracranial hypertension associated with some types of dural AVM.

Abstract
  A clinical case is reported indicating that intracranial pressure (ICP) rises with cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta (CCTA) in humans and does not fall if arterial blood pressure (BP) is lowered by nitroprusside. Hantler and Knight (Anesthesiology 1982;56:146-147) also reported a similar case. We investigated this phenomenon prospectively, measuring ICP, aortic arch BP, and right atrial pressure in 10 halothane-anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits ventilated to pH 7.45-7.55. When CCTA was applied, BP and ICP rose significantly (by paired t test, p less than or equal to 0.01), although right atrial pressure did not change. After removal of the cross-clamp and a period of stabilization, BP was elevated to the same level as that attained with CCTA with phenylephrine. Although phenylephrine induced BP elevation, neither ICP nor CVP changed significantly from control or recovery measurements. In six animals, after applying CCTA, BP was lowered to control levels with nitroprusside (in combination with CCTA). Nitroprusside was effective in lowering BP to control level, but ICP remained elevated as long as the cross-clamping continued. With no rise in central venous pressure, venous engorgement is an unlikely mechanism for ICP elevation. Time constants of ICP change are too short to invoke increased cerebral spinal fluid production or decreased absorption. BP does not rise above the expected range for autoregulation, but recruitment of either arterial capacitance vessels or of a neuroreflex arc, or the effects of cord ischemia disrupting cerebral autoregulation may be the cause of an acute increase in cerebral blood volume.

Abstract
  The effects of a continuous high-dose infusion of midazolam on cerebral function, metabolism, and hemodynamics were studied in nine dogs receiving a spinal anesthetic and breathing 65% nitrogen/35% oxygen. In five dogs, the effects of 65% nitrous oxide (N2O) inspired and the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 were also examined. Midazolam was infused at a rate of 0.66 mg.kg-1.min-1 for 60 min for a total dose of 40 mg.kg-1. Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) (measured by venous outflow technique) both decreased until a plateau level was reached at approximately 75% of control values (4.0 +/- 0.2 ml.min-1.100 g-1 and 49 +/- 3 ml.min-1.100 g-1, respectively, mean +/- SEM). This occurred after 6-10 mg.kg-1 of midazolam, corresponding to serum midazolam levels between 18.4 +/- 3.8 and 31.2 +/- 3.3 micrograms.ml-1. Serum midazolam levels increased throughout the midazolam infusion, reaching a mean value of 53 +/- 5.5 micrograms.ml-1 by the end of the midazolam infusion. A similar plateau was seen for changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG), which never developed burst suppression. Five dogs inspired 65% nitrous oxide/35% oxygen during minutes 30-45 of the midazolam infusion, rather than 65% nitrogen/35% oxygen. Nitrous oxide had no effect upon CMRO2, but significantly increased CBF when compared to dogs receiving nitrogen. Ro 15-1788, 1.0 mg.kg-1 caused a return of CMRO2 and EEG activity to control levels. CBF and intracranial pressure (ICP) increased markedly, to greater than control levels immediately following Ro 15-1788.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract
  Studies were designed to document the normal angiography and pressure-volume characteristics of the canine corpus cavernosum, evaluate the effects of various vasoactive agents, and characterize a veno-occlusive mechanism. In fourteen dogs, baseline cavernosography demonstrated venous drainage via six to ten tributaries arising from the crura and entering the deep penile veins. Control cavernosometry during infusion of saline at 0.33 ml./sec. led to a rise in intracavernosal pressure (ICP) from 24.9 +/- 7.9 mm. Hg to 68.4 +/- 21.1 mm. Hg. Intracavernosal injection of a number of vasodilators, including papaverine, nitroglycerin, acetylcholine, and prostaglandin E2, raised baseline ICP significantly, caused extreme elevation of pressure during saline infusion (greater than 450 mm. Hg), and narrowed or obliterated the venous lumena at the site of tunica perforation, as judged angiographically. These effects could be reversed with phenoxybenzamine or norepinephrine. Our results further support the current understanding of the canine veno-occlusive mechanism.

Abstract
  Angiographic and clinical data from 155 patients with carotid cavernous fistulae were retrospectively reviewed to determine angiographic features associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. These features included presence of a pseudoaneurysm, large varix of the cavernous sinus, venous drainage to cortical veins, and thrombosis of venous outflow pathways distant from the fistula. Clinical signs and symptoms that characterized a hazardous carotid cavernous fistula included increased intracranial pressure, rapidly progressive proptosis, diminished visual acuity, hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attacks. Cortical venous drainage from the carotid cavernous fistula is secondary to occlusion or absence of the normal venous outflow pathways and is associated with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and an increased risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Angiographic demonstration of a cavernous sinus varix, with extension of the sinus into the subarachnoid space, is associated with an increased risk of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Identification of these high-risk features provides a basis for making decisions about treatment.

Abstract
  Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is a diagnosis per exclusionem applied to a condition of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of an intracranial infection, a space-occupying lesion, or hydrocephalus. Diagnostic criteria should include the evaluation of possibly disturbed cerebral venous outflow, which may result in similar clinical findings. Disturbed venous drainage should be separated from the syndrome of PTC because it represents a condition of well-defined origin and therapeutic regimen. Course and prognosis of PTC are not related to the increased intracranial pressure, the degree of papilledema, or to the duration of the disease. Functional cerebral disorders and EEG abnormalities are rare, indicating that brain tissue is not primarily affected. Correspondingly, computerized tomography (CT) scans with respect to the cerebrum are normal in about 90% of the cases; but enlarged optic nerve sheaths (46.7%) and empty sella (45.7%) are frequent findings on CT-scans. They most likely represent a direct consequence of long-term increased pressure within CSF spaces. This observation favors the assumption of disturbed CSF-pressure regulation either by increased production of CSF or its decreased rate of absorption. Brain edema (slit ventricles) as assessed by CT is a rare finding (11.4% of our cases). It may be a hint towards a different pathogenetic entity.

Abstract
  In 60%-90% of cases head injury is a part of multisystem trauma and of very decisive importance for the post-traumatic prognosis. Hypoxia, hypercarbia, and hypotension increase the primary lesion and cause secondary brain damage. Therefore, emergency measures must be directed to the essentials of sustaining vital functions, i.e. intubation/ventilation/oxygenation and stabilization of the circulatory system. All trauma-specific measures should avoid additional increases in intracranial pressure or should decrease it if already elevated. Moderate hyperventilation not only causes cerebral vasoconstriction with a concomitant decrease in intracranial blood volume and intracranial pressure, but also partly restores the disturbed cerebral autoregulation, and is therefore an important part of the emergency care and anesthetic procedure in patients with severe head injuries. It is supplemented by analgesia and sedation to prevent intracranial pressure increases due to painful external stimuli. Elevation of the head and upper part of the body by 30 degrees causes a decrease in intracranial pressure by decreasing intracranial blood volume due to improved venous return from the brain; however, this measure is to be applied only in stable circulatory conditions. The head should be put in mid-position avoiding sideways rotation, flexion, and hyperextension. Osmotically active agents are only indicated in emergency situations when there are signs of clinical deterioration. High-dose barbiturate therapy is reserved as a "last resort", under intensive care conditions, for controlling an otherwise intractable intracranial pressure rise. Calcium antagonists have no indication in this context. Anesthesia in patients with severe head injury must involve only those techniques that do not further increase an already elevated intracranial pressure. As inhalational anesthetics, including nitrous oxide, elevate the intracranial pressure to varying extents due to cerebral vasodilation with a concomitant rise in intracranial blood volume, these substances have to be avoided whenever raised intracranial pressure cannot be excluded. Narcotics, benzodiazepines, small dosages of barbiturates, and long-lasting muscle relaxants can be regarded as useful. [References: 94]

Abstract
  Experimental carbon dioxide brain lesions were created over the intact dura mater of the left parietooccipital region of the anesthetized albino rabbit (40-watt impacts of 0.5-second duration, for a total of 4 seconds, with 0.5-second intervals between impacts), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies were performed with the hydrogen clearance technique. The animals were mechanically ventilated to maintain a constant PaCO2. Blood pressure, central venous pressure, electroencephalogram, and intracranial pressure were continuously monitored. The control CBF before lesion was 64.1 +/- 15.8 and 70.9 +/- 13.4 ml/100 g/minute for the left and the right hemispheres, respectively. CBF studies at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the lesion did not significantly change from the control values, save for a trend to increase over the right hemisphere only at 2 hours (range 106.0 +/- 55.4 to 41.6 +/- 9.3). It is concluded that in this model the changes in intracranial pressure and brain edema that are seen and have been previously reported are not due to change in cerebral circulation. The brain edema that results probably has characteristics similar to those seen in the cryogenic lesion (vasogenic) model, and this could account for the rise in intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  Fourteen patients had classical angiographic findings of intracranial dural arteriovenous malformations (AVM's). They presented with unusual central neurological signs and symptoms, including visual disturbances, hemiparesis, speech disturbances, gait ataxia, diffuse increased intracranial pressure, and intracranial hemorrhage. In 12 of the 14 patients there was a direct correlation between the clinical presentation and the venous drainage characteristics of the AVM's. The symptoms were probably related to a regional steal phenomenon in two patients. Six patients had direct surgical excision of the dural AVM. Five patients underwent endovascular embolization of the malformation and, in one case, the AVM was removed surgically after embolization. In one patient, the external carotid artery in the neck was ligated. Ten of the 14 patients had substantial clinical improvement or cure. A complete anatomical obliteration of the malformation was obtained in seven cases. None of the patients deteriorated clinically after therapy.

Abstract
  Twenty-five patients with expansive pathologic brain lesions, who were anesthetized with thiopental, nitrous oxide in oxygen, and fentanyl, and who were mechanically ventilated to ensure normocarbia, received atracurium besylate 0.6 mg/kg, intravenously. Intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 were simultaneously recorded for 5 min before and for 10 min after administration of the muscle relaxant. No statistically significant changes were observed after administration of atracurium besylate. These results suggest that atracurium besylate may be used for muscle relaxation during neurosurgical operations, despite its potential for histamine release and excitement of the central nervous system.

Abstract
  Spina bifida, Chiari type II malformation, cerebral aqueduct stenosis and hydrocephalus are the most frequent association anomalies in the congenital malformation of the central nervous system (Warkany et al., 1958). They are potentially treatable and of clinical importance. But the relationship between hydrocephalus and Chiari type II malformation is still a controversial subject. A single oral dose of 240 mg/kg of ethylenethiourea (ETU) was given to Sprague Dawley (SD) rats on the 11th day of gestation. Fetuses were removed in the 20th day of gestation by cesarean sections; high incidence of spinal dysraphism associated with hindbrain crowding was found in these fetuses. They are similar to Arnold-Chiari malformation in humans. We used these experimental models to analyze the relationship between hydrocephalus and Chiari type II malformation. From the present investigation, no hydrocephalus or cerebral aqueduct stenosis was found in the experimental rat fetuses with the Arnold-Chiari malformation. So we do not consider the hydrodynamic theory that Chiari type II malformation was induced by increasing intracranial pressure in hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus in the Arnold-Chiari malformation may not be the primary disorder but seems to be caused by plugging the foramen magnum in Chiari type II malformation. So the cerebrospinal fluid in the spinal subarachnoid space can not move upward to the cranial subarachnoid space for absorption to venous return. Cerebral aqueduct stenosis may be secondarily compressed by hydrocephalus and not be the primary development anomaly or acquired occlusion due to gliosis. This is in accord with the theory proposed by Russell and Donald (1935). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract
  In rabbits who had brain edema and intracranial hypertension induced by a combined cold lesion (over the left hemisphere) and a metabolic blocker (6-aminonicotinamide), the authors analyzed the response of multiple parameters following the administration of 6 mcg/kg/dose of fentanyl every 5 minutes for 1 hour (12 doses), combined with nitrous oxide anesthesia. All animals were mechanically ventilated and the PaCO2 was maintained at 37-43 torr. Gross pathology and extent of Evans Blue extravasation was no different from pretreatment control animals. The systolic arterial pressure and the central venous pressure showed no change during the experiment. The intracranial pressure remained elevated despite fentanyl, but did not increase or decrease throughout the administration of the agent. The brain water content remained unchanged in the right hemisphere, but revealed a significant increase following fentanyl in the cold-lesioned left hemisphere for the gray (p less than 0.005) and white matter (p less than 0.05).

Abstract
  Air embolism is a potential hazard during craniotomy whenever intracranial venous pressure is subatmospheric. In order to better understand both the risk of air embolism and its treatment in neurosurgical patients, the authors have investigated the relationship of superior sagittal sinus pressure (SSP) to head position in 15 children and examined the effects of both jugular venous compression and positive end-expiratory airway pressure (PEEP) on SSP. Progressive head elevation significantly decreased mean SSP and, in five patients, SSP was less than 0 mm Hg at 90 degrees torso elevation. A PEEP of 10 cm H2O was ineffective in significantly increasing SSP at any degree of head elevation, whereas bilateral internal jugular compression always caused a significant increase in SSP. The authors conclude that children are at risk for venous air embolism when undergoing suboccipital craniectomy in the sitting position because intracranial venous pressure is often subatmospheric when the head is elevated. Furthermore, maintaining PEEP does not appear to be a reliable treatment for increasing SSP, whereas bilateral internal jugular compression is effective.

Abstract
  Cerebral venous blood gas tensions were correlated with elevated intracranial pressure in spontaneously breathing dogs lightly anesthetized with nitrous oxide/halothane. Intracranial pressure was elevated by infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid into a lateral ventricle. Respiration and blood pressure were monitored. The results of these experiments indicate that cerebral venous carbon dioxide tension is increased in association with elevation in intracranial pressure. Moreover, it appears that cerebral venous pCO2 is effectively regulated at a mean of about 52 mm Hg over a wide range of intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  This paper reviews recent applications of mechanical ventilation such as controlled hypoventilation in acute asthma, domiciliary nocturnal ventilation in chronic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease and improvement of left ventricular performance by raised intrathoracic pressure. Established uses of mechanical ventilation include control of respiratory failure, intracranial pressure and pulmonary hypertension while other uses such as internal splinting of flail chest, simultaneous ventilation-compression cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prophylactic postoperative ventilation are more controversial.

Abstract
  The effects of halothane and isoflurane on regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) were studied in 18 New Zealand White rabbits anesthetized with nitrous oxide (N2O) and morphine sulfate (MS) at three different levels of PaCO2. CBF was measured using the hydrogen clearance technique. Monitored variables were intracranial pressure (ICP), central venous pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, electroencephalogram, arterial blood gases, end-tidal (ET) volatile anesthetic, and ET CO2. Addition of 1 MAC halothane to the N2O/MS background anesthetic caused flow to increase significantly in all three regions studied (cortex, dorsal hippocampus, white matter) at all three levels of PaCO2 (low: 20-25 mmHg; normal: 35-40 mmHg; high: 50-55 mmHg). Addition of 1 MAC isoflurane to the background anesthetic caused CBF to decrease significantly in all regions during hypocapnia. During normocapnia, CBF was unchanged with the addition of 1 MAC isoflurane in all regions and during hypercapnia, CBF increased significantly only in the dorsal hippocampus following addition of 1 MAC isoflurane to the MS/N2O background anesthetic. Volatile anesthetic administration was associated with significant, although small, increases in ICP at all PaCO2 levels. We conclude that 1 MAC concentrations of halothane and isoflurane have opposite effects on CBF when added to a N2O/MS anesthetic during hypocapnia and that the effects of isoflurane on regional CBF are dependent on PaCO2 in rabbits under the anesthetic conditions of this experiment.

Abstract
  The effects of iv succinylcholine (SCh) on the electroencephalogram (EEG), cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate (CMRO2), intracranial pressure (ICP), central venous pressure (CVP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were tested in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Six dogs were maintained at 0.87 +/- 0.00% (mean +/- SE) expired halothane (1.0 MAC) and received both SCh 1.0 mg X kg-1 and lactated Ringer's solution placebo 0.05 ml X kg-1. Fasciculations began 24 +/- 4 s after iv SCh. Fasciculations were followed by immediate EEG arousal in five of six dogs and increases in CBF in all six. Average CBF was 151 +/- 14% of control for the 0-15 min measurement period and 127 +/- 7% of control for the 15-30 min period. Both were significantly greater than pre-SCh control values and placebo group values. Peak CBF of 177 +/- 19% of control occurred 3 min after iv SCh and was accompanied by a peak ICP of 435 +/- 131% of control. ICP values were significantly different between SCh and placebo treatments only during the periods of greatest CBF (1 to 5 min after iv SCh). Average PaCO2 values after iv SCh were significantly greater than pre-SCh control values and placebo values during each 15-min measurement interval. Average PaCO2 was 116 +/- 2% of control during the 0-15 min measurement period, 114 +/- 2% of control during the 15-30 min period, and 109 +/- 1% of control during the 30-45 min period. CVP, MAP, and CMRO2 did not significantly change after iv SCh.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract
  The influence of respiratory frequency, tidal volume, inspiratory flow and ratio of inspiratory/expiratory time on ventilator-related intracranial pressure (ICP) fluctuations was studied in six patients with severe brain trauma. ICP fluctuations were found to be markedly reduced at frequencies of 20/min and usually eliminated at 30/min. We found an exponential correlation between ICP fluctuations and respiratory frequency, but there was no correlation between tidal volume and ICP. Central venous pressure amplitudes were found to be in linear correlation with respiratory frequency and tidal volumes as well. The amplitude of respiratory ICP fluctuations correlates with the length of expiratory time. Our findings demonstrate that artificial ventilation without ventilator-related fluctuations in ICP ("brain-protective" ventilation) may be performed by conventional volume-constant, time-cycled ventilators. To assess the therapeutic relevance of eliminating respirator-related fluctuations of the ICP course in brain-injured patients, we suggest that frequencies of 25-30/min and tidal volumes of 6-9 ml/kg body weight should be used.

Abstract
  Autoregulatory adjustments in the caliber of cerebral arterioles were studied in anesthetized cats equipped with cranial windows for the direct observation of the pial microcirculation. Increased venous pressure caused slight, but consistent, arteriolar dilation, at normal and at reduced arterial blood pressure and irrespective of whether or not intracranial pressure was kept constant or allowed to increase. Arterial hypotension caused arteriolar dilation which was inhibited partially by perfusion of the space under the cranial window with artificial CSF equilibrated with high concentrations of oxygen. This vasodilation was inhibited to a greater extent by perfusion of the space under the cranial window with fluorocarbon FC-80, equilibrated with high concentrations of oxygen. CSF or fluorocarbon equilibrated with nitrogen did not influence the vasodilation in response to arterial hypotension. The response to increased venous pressure was converted to vasoconstriction when fluorocarbon equilibrated with high concentrations of oxygen was flowing under the cranial window. The vasodilation in response to arterial hypotension was inhibited by topical application of adenosine deaminase. The results show that both metabolic and myogenic mechanisms play a role in cerebral arteriolar autoregulation. Under normal conditions, the metabolic mechanisms predominate. The presence of the myogenic mechanisms may be unmasked by preventing the operation of the metabolic mechanisms. The major metabolic mechanism seems to be dependent on changes in PO2 within the brain with secondary release of adenosine.

Abstract
  The effect of diltiazem-induced hypotension on intracranial pressure (ICP) was studied in dogs with normal and elevated ICP. Eight dogs were anesthetized with intravenous pentobarbital, intubated, and ventilated with N2O:O2. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), central venous pressure (CVP), and cardiac out-put (CO) were recorded. A ventriculostomy was performed for measurement of ICP. Baselines were established, and diltiazem was infused to reduce MAP 40 +/- 1% for 10 min. After recording the effects of diltiazem-induced hypotension during normal ICP, ICP was elevated by infusion through a ventriculostomy cannula of pH-adjusted Ringer's lactate, baselines were reestablished, and MAP was again reduced by 40 +/- 1% with diltiazem. When baseline ICP was normal, diltiazem-induced hypotension produced a statistically significant increase in ICP (4.8 +/- 0.6 mm Hg) and a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). When baseline ICP was elevated, a smaller increase in ICP occurred (1.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg). Although these increases in ICP were not clinically significant, the dose of diltiazem required to lower MAP 40% caused significant alterations in HR, systemic vascular resistance, CO, and PCWP. Serious cardiac rhythm disturbances occurred in five of eight dogs when baseline ICP was normal and in six of eight dogs when baseline ICP was elevated. The relatively long duration of diltiazem's hemodynamic effect and the high incidence of cardiac rhythm disturbances make it an unsuitable drug for inducing deliberate hypotension.

Abstract
  The effectiveness of various sized shunts placed between the ascending and the descending aorta to prevent paraplegia in dogs with the thoracic aorta cross-clamped for 1 hour was tested. Three tapered shunts sizes were used with tip dimensions of 3.8, 5.2, and 6.3 mm inner diameter, with cross-sectional areas of 11.34, 21.23, and 33.18 mm2, respectively, and with an equal midportion diameter of 10 mm (3/8 inch). These shunts carried 40%, 60%, and 72% respectively, of baseline descending aortic flow during the cross-clamping period. Flow distribution was measured with radioactive microspheres in the spinal cord (gray and white matter) and kidneys. All dogs without shunts (Group I) developed paraplegia, severe proximal circulatory embarrassment, and severe ischemia of the spinal cord (mainly gray matter) that was followed by marked hyperemia persisting up to 24 hours following the experiment. Mortality was 33%. Only animals treated with large shunts (Groups III and IV) avoided paraplegia and postischemic injury. An effective shunt was characterized as carrying 60% or more of baseline descending aortic flow, having a cross-sectional area at its tip equal to or larger than 29% of the descending aorta, and equaling at least 54% of its diameter. Porportionately, the size of the tridodecylmethylamonium-heparin shunts being used in human beings (even the largest 9 mm inner diameter) is significantly inadequate to maintain distal flows and pressures for the prevention of spinal cord injury. Four clinical options are discussed.

Abstract
  The responses of cerebral (pial) arterioles to increased venous pressure were examined in anesthetized cats equipped with cranial windows for the observation of the cerebral microcirculation. Increased venous pressure was induced by occlusion of the superior vena cava. Intracranial pressure was kept constant. Increased venous pressure when the window was filled with stationary cerebrospinal fluid caused 9-12% arteriolar dilation. Cerebral arteriolar dilation of equal magnitude (8-12%) was also seen when the space under the cranial window was perfused with fluorocarbon FC-80 equilibrated with 100% nitrogen. Increased venous pressure when the cranial window space was perfused with fluorocarbon equilibrated with 100% oxygen caused a small (5%) but significant arteriolar constriction. These results show that the dominant mechanism of autoregulation in the cerebral arterioles is metabolic, and that it involves an oxygen-sensitive mechanism. Myogenic vasoconstriction is unmasked during venous hypertension when the dominant metabolic mechanism is eliminated by increased local supply of oxygen.

Abstract
  Continuous recording of intracranial pressure (ICP) from one lateral ventricle in a case of histologically proven delayed temporal radionecrosis due to previous irradiation of the pituitary gland for the treatment of an adiposity of the Cushing type has revealed the occurrence of B-waves and ramplike waves despite the absence of raised intracranial pressure. Ventriculo-atrial shunting failed to relieve the severe psychic symptomatology, which was due to direct tissue damage. These observations indicate that B-waves may have a neurogenic origin.

Abstract
  Changes in intrathoracic pressure may influence intracranial pressure (ICP), presumably by affecting venous return. High-frequency ventilation (HFV) has been associated with lower intrapleural and airway pressures and has the potential to lower ICP. To evaluate the effects of HFV compared to conventional ventilation on ICP, normocarbia was maintained in nine dogs while alternating between conventional ventilation and HFV at 200 breaths/min. The mean ICP was raised from 6.3 +/- 6.1 to 24.7 +/- 1.04 mm Hg by inflation of Fogarty balloons implanted in the epidural space. The ICP peaks associated with positive inflation pressures were eliminated with HFV, but mean ICP was not significantly different between the two ventilatory modes (23.4 +/- 9.7 mm Hg for the conventional system versus 26.0 +/- 10.0 mm Hg for HFV). Four dogs exhibited neurogenic pulmonary edema: they developed elevated pulmonary artery and intrathoracic pressures and required increased inspiratory flow with HFV to maintain normocarbia. The authors conclude that, in this head-injury model, there did not seem to be an advantage of HFV over conventional ventilation.

Abstract
  A 7-yr-old boy undergoing treatment for respiratory failure after near-drowning developed a pneumomediastinum. Intracranial hypertension refractory to previously successful therapy led to placement of a mediastinal tube, after which intracranial pressure decreased and was easier to control. A pneumomediastinum may cause intracranial hypertension by interfering with venous drainage from the cranium.

Abstract
  Sixty-seven patients with severe head injury underwent intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (10 extradural and 57 intraventricular). All patients had Liege coma scale (LCS) score of 12 or less. Ventriculitis (E. Coli) occurred in one patient (1,8%). The intraventricular method allows C.S.F. drainage with lowering of I.C.P. even with slit ventricles. After 8 days, if an intracranial hypertension persists, we perform a ventriculo-atrial drainage. Pressure recording is a useful way of following the patient's evolution and a guide for prognosis of survival. If I.C.P. is constantly below 5 torr, then the probability of a bad outcome is great. The study also confirms the high mortality rate (93%) if I.C.P. is greater than 40 torr.

Abstract
  Changes in intracranial pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure in response to sequential inflation of the pneumatic antishock garment were monitored in 12 patients with severe head injury and initial intracranial pressure less than 20 mm Hg. The small incremental increases in intracranial pressure that occurred with inflation of the pneumatic antishock garment were compensated for by improved hemodynamic stability and elevated mean arterial blood pressure which produced a simultaneous rise in cerebral perfusion pressure. The treatment of hypotension in traumatized patients with head injuries is paramount and sequential slow inflation of the pneumatic antishock garment can be used in such patients without apparent ill effect to the brain when the initial intracranial pressure is 20 mm Hg or below. Further study is needed to determine the safety of the device in head injured patients with elevated intracranial pressures.

Abstract
  The effect of high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) on intracranial pressure (ICP) in the series of seven patients with severe head injury was studied. These patients received mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure accompanied with neural damage or circulatory shock and for ICP control by decreasing PaCO2. ICP was measured continuously by subarachnoid catheter method connected to Gould P-50 strain-gage transducer and controlled by hyperventilation and/or osmotic diuretics during acute phase. Arterial pressure, central venous pressure and intratracheal pressure were measured continuously in the same way. Arterial blood gases were analysed by BG-I of Technicon Co. Ltd. At the weaning from respirator, two methods were applied. One was conventional IMV (with PEEP) and/or CPAP by using IMV mode of Servo 900 respirator or T-piece together with PEEP valve and another was new-fashioned HFJV. Mean intratracheal pressure (mPit) was fixed at 0 mmHg (control value), 5, 10 and 15mmHg in both methods by adjusting PEEP valve or driving pressure of HFJV. The result is that in the same patients ICP was significantly lower during HFJV than IMV/CPAP when mPit was 5 and 10mmHg. Only three cases having been studied at 15mmHg of mPit because circulatory condition would not permit it, significant difference of ICP between HFJV and IMV/CPAP was not detected. PaCO2, being suspected to be the cause of lower ICP of HFJV group, was studied too. But blood gas analysis showed no significant difference neither PaCO2 nor PaO2. The fluctuation of CVP reflecting the change of intrathracic pressure was smaller in HFJV group than in IMV/CPAP group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract
  A variety of central nervous system (CNS) insults may be complicated by the acute development of pulmonary edema. This occurrence has been termed neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE), and experimental models have clearly shown that CNS insults may cause pulmonary edema. Unfortunately, the pathophysiologic aspects of this response are not clearly understood. Basing an approach to the development of pulmonary edema on Starling's equation leads to the conclusion that NPE is caused by changes in pulmonary endothelial permeability and/or microvascular pressures. It was previously suggested (the "blast theory") that CNS insults caused acute systemic arterial and pulmonary venous spasm and increased venous return, which would result in a severe pulmonary vascular hydrostatic insult and a secondary permeability defect. Although such hydrostatic derangements may explain certain cases of NPE, recent clinical and experimental studies have indicated that CNS disorders may cause a permeability defect without a vascular insult. The mediating factor for a permeability defect is not clear. The implications of these findings are that NPE may be caused by either permeability abnormalities or hydrostatic insults, may present clinically in a variety of ways, and may require different approaches to treatment. Our understanding of the CNS sites that might mediate NPE is not sophisticated enough, at present, to define the neural mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of NPE.

Abstract
  Furosemid administration to patients with intracranial hypertension of tumour genesis was associated with temporal regression of general cerebral symptoms, coinciding in time with the period marked by a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure. A correlation between the magnitude of this decrease and the furosemid-induced elevated secretion of urine containing chlorine and sodium was established. Restoration of the liquid lost from the body following drug administration was not accompanied by either a fall in the cerebrospinal fluid pressure or a change in the intensity of general cerebral symptoms. The action of furosemid on intracranial pressure is explained by a reduction in the central venous pressure, by an increased outflow of the venous blood from the cranial cavity as well as by its diminished volume. Concomitant administration of large quantities of water lowers or completely precludes the hypotensive action of the agent on intracranial pressure and, thus, is considered unadvisable.

Abstract
  Albino rabbits with experimental brain oedema produced by a combined cryogenic left hemisphere and a metabolic 6-aminonicotinamide lesion were given indomethacin (20 mg/kg) fifteen minutes prior to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment (1 g/kg bolus). Intracranial pressure (ICP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and EEG were continuously measured while the animals were being mechanically ventilated at a constant PaCO2 (38-42 torr). At the end of the run, brain H2O and electrolytes were measured. There was no significant reduction in ICP at 5 minutes and 15 minutes after DMSO. This was strikingly different to what occurred when DMSO alone was administered, when a significant reduction was noted (p less than 0.05). At 30 minutes there was a reduction in ICP in both the DMSO and the DMSO/indomethacin groups, but in the former it was 50% of the pretreatment values while in the latter it was only 24%. Because indomethacin is a proven prostaglandin inhibitor, these results suggest that these substances may play a role in the mechanism of action of DMSO.

Abstract
  Albumin plays an important role in maintaining an adequate plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP). On the basis of the Starling's law, we postulated that elevation of plasma COP produced by infusion of serum albumin would result in the withdrawal of cerebral interstitial fluid. To test the hypothesis that an oncotic gradient would produce cerebral dehydration and result in reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP), we infused intravenously 25% solution of salt-poor human serum albumin, 2g/kg over 60 minutes for 10 patients with increased ICP. In these 10 patients, the degree of brain edema was not severe but mild to moderate by judging from CT scan findings. In addition to ICP, various parameters such as mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), central venous pressure (CVP), pulse rate, PaCO2 and urine volume were measured before, during and after albumin infusion. Hematological studies including COP, total protein, albumin-globulin ratio, protein fractions, hematocrit (Ht), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and electrolytes were also performed before, during and after administration of albumin. The raised ICP (27.4 +/- S.E. 1.6 mmHg) decreased significantly down to 19.1 (+/- 1.9) mmHg and remained stable for at least 240 minutes without any changes of MABP, pulse rate and PaCO2. CVP elevated significantly and remained at higher levels in comparison with control despite increase of urine output after administration of albumin. This results suggested that an adequate circulatory volume was maintained. A significant increase of total protein, serum albumin concentrations and albumin-globulin ratio was noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract
  Brain damage following open-heart surgery is receiving increasing attention. Efforts are being made to improve the setting for cardiac surgery so as to avoid such complications. When they occur, their recognition is retrospective, when the cerebral lesion is inevitable. Because heavy sedation is necessary, clinical supervision with respect to brain function is both difficult and unreliable in the early postoperative period. We therefore submitted 34 selected patients to neurosurgical intensive care supervision. The measures included postoperative monitoring of intracranial epidural pressure (EDP), of arterial blood pressure (BP) and of central venous pressure (CVP). In 25 patients there was rise in EDP during the first postoperative hours. Six of these patients received mannitol treatment and in three of them barbiturate was additionally given, in order to reduce EDP and improve the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = BP-EDP). Nevertheless EDP progressed to brain tamponade six days postoperatively in one case. In patients with raised EDP, weaning from the ventilator should be postponed until EDP has almost normalized. The EDP recording is a valuable guide in the postoperative management of the individual patient.

Abstract
  The authors analyze the development of optic disc congestion in patients with acute polyradiculoneuritis. Basing on an analysis of the brain hydrodynamics examined with the aid of the subarachnoidal infusion test, the authors come to the conclusion that the main pathogenetic factor responsible for the development of intracranial hypertension and optic disc congestion in the patients examined is the syndrome of the decreased cerebrospinal fluid absorption. It is emphasized that basic to the treatment of intracranial hypertension and optic disc edema during the disease in question should be measures aimed at the improved drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid to the cerebral venous system.

Abstract
  The purpose of this report is to compare the effect of acute therapy with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and pentobarbitone on experimental brain oedema produced by a cryogenic lesion over the left hemisphere in albino rabbits. A group of animals received DMSO (1 mg/kg-10% solution) by intravenous bolus, and another group received a pentobarbitone intravenous 30-minute infusion (40 mg/kg). Intracranial pressure (ICP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and EEG were studied. Brain water and electrolyte content were analyzed at one hour following the initiation of therapy. ICP was promptly reduced with both forms of therapy. A 66% reduction from control values was reached at 50 +/- 12 minutes with pentobarbitone, and a 45% reduction from control values was reached at 30 minutes with DMSO. There was no significant reduction in the water content of the brain with either form of therapy. A significant elevation in brain potassium content was noted following DMSO when compared to untreated controls. CVP was essentially unchanged in both groups. Pentobarbitone produced a reduction of SAP with a mean value of 20.3 torr at 45 minutes from infusion. DMSO produced no reduction of SAP. It is concluded that DMSO and pentobarbitone are just as effective in reducing ICP. DMSO has the capacity to maintain SAP which pentobarbitone does not have, thus assuring a better cerebral perfusion pressure.

Abstract
  Albino rabbits with experimental brain edema produced by a combined cryogenic and metabolic 6-aminonicotinamide lesion were administered intravenous dimethyl sulfoxide in varying concentrations and doses in the following manner: Subgroup A (concentration response) received a 1.0-g/kg bolus as a 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40% solution. Subgroup B (dose response) received as a 20% solution a 1.0-g/kg bolus, 1.5-g/kg bolus, or 2.0-g/kg infusion. Simultaneous recording of intracranial pressure (ICP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and central venous pressure and electroencephalography were performed while the animals were being mechanically ventilated at a constant PaCO2 (38 to 42 torr). There was significant lowering of ICP when compared to pretreatment values in Subgroup A in the 10% subset at 30 minutes (p less than 0.05) and in the 20% subset at 5 (p less than 0.05) and 30 (p less than 0.05) minutes. ICP was not significantly decreased in the 30% and 40% subsets. All animals of Subgroup B displayed significant reductions of ICP when compared to their pretreatment values. There was no significant change in SAP in either subgroup.

Abstract
  Twelve dogs were anesthetized and instrumental for determination of CVP, arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, left atrial pressure, and frontal cerebral cortical blood flow (CCBF) by the thermal method. A catheter was introduced into the venous return of the cerebral confluence to allow determination of cerebral A-V oxygen saturation differences. The animals were placed on cardiac bypass using a circuit from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery and a second circuit from the left ventricular apex to the left femoral artery. A heat exchanger was used to maintain a constant blood temperature of 37 C in the output of the left side bypass circuit. All animals were heparinized during bypass. Ventricular fibrillation was induced after completion of the bypass surgery. Two dogs served as controls. Pre-arrest determinations of hemoglobin, glucose, CCBF, and cerebral A-V oxygen differences were taken. Full circulatory arrest was carried out for 20 minutes by shutting off the cardiac bypass. Resuscitation was achieved by resumption of bypass perfusion. Acid-base balance was corrected quickly, and pre-arrest perfusion pressure was achieved and maintained for 90 minutes. All pressure parameters were monitored continuously. All pre-arrest determinations were repeated at 20, 40, 60, and 90 minutes post resuscitation. Five dogs were treated with 6 microgram/kg flunarizine administered IV drip over 10 minutes immediately post reperfusion. Five dogs were not treated post arrest. Treated animals had a prompt return of CCBF rates equal to or greater than pre-arrest flow, which persisted throughout the period of post-arrest observation. Untreated animals had markedly reduced CCBF and increased resistance. CCBF uniformly proceeded to near zero flow by 90 minutes. The ICP was not significantly altered by treatment.

Abstract
  Albino rabbits with experimental brain edema produced by a combined cryogenic left hemisphere lesion and metabolic 6-aminonicotinamide lesion were administered a 3-hour intravenous infusion of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Simultaneous recording of intracranial pressure (ICP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and central venous pressure (CVP) and electroencephalography were performed while the animals were being ventilated mechanically to produce a constant Pa CO2 value (38-42 torr). At the end of the infusion, the brain water and electrolyte contents were measured. There was a persistent and progressive reduction of ICP during the infusion, the nadir occurring at 3 hours (p less than 0.005 from zero time), with no change in SAP or CVP. There was a reduction of brain water in both hemispheres when compared to untreated controls, but this was significant for the right hemisphere only (p less than 0.005). There was a significant reduction of the brain sodium content for both hemispheres, but no significant change occurred in brain potassium content. The DMSO infusion was effective not only in reducing ICP, but also in sustaining this reduction for 3 hours.

Abstract
  Increased intracranial pressure due to brain oedema was produced in albino rabbits by combining a cryogenic lesion in the left hemisphere with the intraperitoneal administration of 6-aminonicotinamide (cytotoxic agent). The following parameters were assessed: intracranial pressure (ICP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), central venous pressure (CVP), EEG, brain water and electrolyte content, gross pathology, and blood brain barrier integrity. Acute therapy to reduce ICP was performed by administering a bolus of mannitol (1 gm/kg) and 30 minutes later, also in bolus, frusemide (5 mg/kg). Immediately following the administration of mannitol an infusion of pentobarbitone was commenced; this was continued for one hour so that a total of 10 mg/kg was administered. There was a 50% reduction of ICP at one hour from initiation of treatment. The brains of the animals were extracted immediately upon cessation of therapy (pentobarbitone) and they revealed a significant reduction of water content for the right, uninjured, hemisphere only, when compared to controls; a slight but not significant reduction of the brain sodium and potassium was noted in both hemispheres. There was no change noted in the gross pathology and extent of blood brain barrier breakdown. In all animals epinephrine infusion had to be administered for between 20 and 30 minutes to maintain a SAP over 80 torr. There seems to be no advantage in the simultaneous administration of barbiturates and diuretics for the control of ICP due to brain oedema.

Abstract
  The intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored in a number of patients who were being treated by mechanical ventilation for head injury. The effect on the pressure of routine nursing procedures was studied. Fourteen out of thirty-three cases (group 1) showed small reversible rises in ICP during suction, insertion of a N/G tube, or i.m. injections. These were associated with similar small increases in intrathoracic pressure and small fluctuations in arterial blood pressure. These rises were effectively treated with additional doses of relaxants. In a small group of patients (group 2) irreversible intracranial hypertension was induced by some of these stimuli, but did not respond to the administration of more relaxants, although sedatives such as papaveretum reduced it in some cases, but only slightly.

Abstract
  Albino rabbits with experimental brain edema produced by a cryogenic lesion or by a cryogenic lesion combined with a metabolic blocker, 6-aminonicotinamide, were given 1 g of a 10% solution of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) per kg by intravenous bolus. Simultaneous recording of intracranial pressure (ICP), systemic arterial pressure (SAP), and central venous pressure and electroencephalography were performed while the animals were mechanically ventilated at a constant PaCO2 (PaCO2, 38 to 42 torr). One hour after the administration of DMSO, the rabbits were killed by air embolus, and the brain was removed promptly for the determination of wet and dry weights and electrolyte content. The ICP at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after DMSO was lower in both groups; ICP was significantly lower at 30 minutes (p less than 0.5) in the cold lesion group and at 15 minutes in the combined group (p less than 0.05). These was no significant change in SAP after DMSO in either group. There was s significant reduction of brain water content after DMSO in the combined lesion group (p less than 0.005 for the left hemisphere and p less than 0.025 for the right); there was no significant reduction of water content in the group with a cold lesion only.

Abstract
  A case of severe head injury associated with fulminant pulmonary edema considered as neurogenic which developed within short time after the injury was presented. A five-year-old boy who had no previous history of cardiopulmonary disease was struck on his right frontal region by car accident at 15.30 PM on July 5 of 1979. Immediately after the impact he lost his consciousness and subsequently transferred to a local hospital where bilateral dilated pupil and flaccid paralysis of the limbs were noted. On transmission of the patient to Omuta City Hospital 30 minutes after the injury, massive foamy fluid was discharged from the tracheal tube. On admission, he was comatous, with bilateral dilated and fixed pupils and flaccid paralysis of the limbs. There was no retinal bleeding. He showed ataxic respiration with severe stridor and massive discharge of foamy fluid pinkish in colour from the trachea characteristic in pulmonary edema was significant. Chest x-ray film demonstrated perihilar densities suggesting pulmonary edema. CT scan showed extremely small ventricle on both sides without manifestations of intracranial hematomas or cerebral contusion. With an intensive medical treatments including corticosteroids, alkalizing agents and alpha-blocker were administered under controlled respiration, the discharge of edema fluid was gradually decreased and the findings on blood gases were also improved. However neurological signs were aggravated and he died 8 hours after the injury. Central venous pressure was maintained at the level between 8 to 10 cm. From these clinical findings the pulmonary edema was concluded as neurogenic. Direct or indirect injury to the hypothalamic efferent pathway at the level of lower brain stem seemed to be important as the cause of neurogenic pulmonary edema in this case. The possible pathophysiology of neurogenic pulmonary edema associated with brain stem injury and intracranial hypertension was discussed with other related literature.

Abstract
  Germinal matrix hemorrhage leading to intraventricular hemorrhage results from an excessive pressure gradient between the blood-vessel lumen and the surrounding brain tissue. This gradient may be caused by increased intravascular pressure or--as this paper hypothesises--by decreased tissue pressure. Brain-tissue pressure depends on water content, and it decreases when water moves out of the brain, as occurs in conditions associated with dehydration, plasma hyperosmolality or hypotension. Such conditions occur frequently in premature infants, which may explain why intraventricular hemorrhage develops with a delay after birth. Its coincidence in time with postnatal head-shrinkage and its association with plasma hyperosmolality, hyperosmolar alkali therapy and hypotension strengthen the hypothesis of a cause and effect relationship between reduced cerebral tissue pressure and intraventricular hemorrhage.

Abstract
  Compared to traditional, low-frequency ventilation (LFV), mechanical ventilation at high frequencies (60-200 breaths/min) and low tidal volumes (HFV) is known to: 1) eliminate respiratory-synchronous variations in blood pressure; 2) minimize ventilatory effects on the cardiovascular system; 3) reduce peak airway pressures; and 4) suppress spontaneous respiratory efforts. Since these and other properties may make HFV useful in patients with acute intracranial pathology, we studied the effects of HFV on intracranial pressure (ICP) in cats. Compared with LFV (rate 11/min, tidal volume equals 15 ml/kg), HFV (rate 100/min, VT equals 3.3 ml/kg) had little effect on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, right atrial pressure, mean ICP or mean cerebral perfusion pressures, even if baseline ICP was raised using an epidural balloon. However, HFV effectively eliminated ventilator-linked fluctuations in both blood pressure and ICP, and at all levels of mean ICP studied (4.8, 15, and 30 torr), significantly reduced the peak ICP seen during a single respiratory cycle. The reduction in ICP fluctuation and peak pressure was more pronounced as intracranial complicance fell. However, the physiologic significance of such a change in the ICP pressure waveform is unknown. Because of the observed influence of HFV on ICP fluctuations, we also examined its effects on the physical movement of the exposed brain, using a non-contact, inductive displacement measuring device. During LFV, the cortical surface moved "in and out" by 0.36 plus or minus 0.1 (plus or minus SD) mm, a distance sufficient to make microscopic focusing difficult. Changing to HFV reduced surface movement to 0.05 plus or minus 0.01 mm, producing a very stable surface. These results suggested that HFV may play a very important role in the intraoperative management oif patients undergoing certain neurosurgical procedures, particularly those requiring microsurgical techniques where reduced brain movement may facilitate surgery.

Abstract
  The effect of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) of mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O was studied in 23 paralyzed, ventilated goats which were divided into three treatment groups. Group I received no volume expansion agent to counteract the hemodynamic effects of PEEP. Group II received normal saline to maintain a constant arterial blood pressure (BP), and Group III received a mannitol solution for BP maintenance. In all three groups there were similar increases in central venous pressure (CVP) of approximately 2.5 times the zero PEEP level at 15 cm H2O PEEP (P less than 0.001). In Group I, BP fell an average of 32 per cent, cardiac output fell 47 per cent and cisternal CSFP increased 40 per cent above zero PEEP levels at 15 cm H2O PEEP (P less than 0.01). CBF in this group was decreased 18 per cent when compared with the zero PEEP baseline at 15 cm H2O PEEP (P less than 0.008). In Group II animals there were no significant changes in BP or cardiac output (CO) at any of the PEEP levels. CSFP in this group, at 15 cm H2O PEEP, increased 84 per cent above the baseline zero level and CBF decreased 32 per cent at 15 cm H2O PEEP when compared to the zero PEEP level (P less than 0.008). In Group III there were no significant reductions in BP or CO. Unlike Groups I and II, no significant changes in CFSP were observed at any level of PEEP. In addition, CBF in this group did not change significantly from the zero-PEEP baseline level any level of PEEP. Thus, when PEEP therapy is associated with substantial decreases in BP and CO, CBF may decrease as well. Maintenance of BP and CO by volume expansion with a crystalloid solution resulted in a greater reduction in CBF than in the untreated group but maintenance of BP and CO by mannitol infusion resulted in maintenance of CBF at the baseline, pre-PEEP level. The authors conclude that brain interstitial fluid pressure is an important variable in the determination of cerebral blood flow during ventilation with PEEP.

Abstract
  The effect of up to 15 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on cerebrospinal fluid pressure (Pcsf) was investigated in five anaesthetised, mechanically ventilated dogs during normal and then elevated (40-50 cm H2O) intracranial pressure (ICP). Stepwise elevations of PEEP in 5 cm H2O increments resulted in small rises in Pcsf at normal ICP and in significantly larger rises when ICP was elevated. The regression equations for the relationships between Pcsf and end-expiratory pressure (EEP) were as follows: Pcsf = 12.95 + 0.82 EEP for normal ICP, and Pcsf = 46.41 + 2.06 EEP for elevated ICP. Mean PaCO2 rose from 39.7 +/- 2.5 to 47.6 +/- 5.0 torr during normal ICP, and from 34.2 +/- 2.9 to 50.9 +/0- 5.3 torr at elevated ICP as PEEP was elevated to 15 cm H2O. We conclude that PEEP raised Pcsf, and that this increase is more severe under conditions of elevated ICP. The rise in Pcsf due to PEEP may be explained by either the rise in intrathoracic pressure or the rise in PaCO2, or both.

Abstract
  Superior sagittal sinus pressure, intracranial pressure and arterial pressure were recorded in an experimental series on 10 cats. During drug-induced, severe, acute arterial hypertension and parallel hypercapnia, venous pressure could exceed intracranial pressure in both the supra- and infratentorial compartment. From these data it is concluded that cerebral venous pressure during acute arterial hypertension may contribute to protein extravasation at the postcapillary-venular level.

Abstract
  Hemodynamic, respiratory, and cerebral variables during 2 h of standard external CPR were studied in 5 dogs. In an additional 12 dogs, possible augmentation of these variables by Military Anti-Shock Trousers (MAST) was evaluated. In 9 dogs, external and internal cardiac massage were compared. During ventricular fibrillation (VF) and after 2 min of circulatory arrest, standard CPR basic life support (without drug support) could sustain only borderline values: systolic arterial pressure (SAP) remained at 70--80 mm Hg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 35--45 mm Hg. Sternal compressions increased central venous pressure (CVP) to near SAP, and also increased intracranial pressure (ICP), but less than CVP. Thus, systemic perfusion pressures (SPP, i.e., MAP-mean CVP) control value 130 mm Hg) were only 11--15 mm Hg; and cerebral perfusion pressures (CPP, i.e., MAP-ICP) were 20--32 mm Hg during CPR. Common carotid arterial blood flow (CCABF) remained at an average of 8--20% of control values. Normalization of aerobic metabolism proved impossible (final pHa of 7.1). During external CPR, MAST inflation moderately increased MAP, SAP, SPP, and CPP; and significantly increased CCABF from 6.8 to 13.2% of prearrest control. The MAST failed to improve cerebral venous PO2, pupil signs, and EEG activity. With fixed pressure IPPV/100% O2, the MAST decreased tidal volumes and PaO2 (increased shunting); and increased PaCO2 and acidemia. Epinephrine 1 mg iv improved arterial pressures but not flows. A switch to open-chest (internal) cardiac massage (OCCM) after 2 h of external CPR significantly increased arterial and perfusion pressures (decreased venous pressures) and more than doubled CCABF; and resulted in a return of EEG activity and pupillary constriction. Prolonged standard CPR, and to a lesser extent MAST-augmented CPR, seem unlikely to maintain adequate oxygen transport for vital organ systems viability, particularly the brain. OCCM might better sustain viability.

Abstract
  In nine patients undergoing neurosurgical operation for cerebral aneuryms haemodynamic measurements were made before, during and after continuous intravenous administration of Nitroglycerin at a mean dose of 6.5 micrograms/kg . min. Within 15 min of the start of the infusion mean arterial pressure fell from 94.2 +/- 10.5 to 73.4 +/- 11.1 mm Hg. A further decrease of mean arterial pressure even by a substantial raising of the Nitroglycerin dose was not possible. 15 min after the discontinuation of Nitroglycerin administration mean arterial pressure rose to the preinfusion level. The decrease of stroke volume index from 40.8 +/- 9.9 to 31.0 +/- 7.3 ml/m2 was partially compensated by an increase of heart rate from 65.9 +/- 9.6 to 77.7 +/- 19.4 beats/min. Consequently cardiac index fell only slightly from 2.9 +/- 0.6 to 2.5 +/- 0.5 ml/min . m2. The right atrial pressure decreased to 3.3 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure to 6.3 +/- 1.9 mm Hg and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to 2.3 +/- 2.1 mm Hg. The significant fall of total peripheral resistance to 983 +/- 194 dyn x s/cm5 (p less than 0.05) and the decrease of left ventricular stroke work index to 34.7 +/- 11.5 g . m/m2 contributed to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption. The authors conclude that, because of its effect on blood pressure, it reversibility of action and its absence of adverse side effects Nitroglycerin is a valuable agent for controlled hypotension.

Abstract
  The intracranial impedance (34 kHz, AC) decreased by 20--40% during i. v. infusion of hypertonic mannitol and urea solutions (1.5 g/kg) and 1 hr later owing to osmotic dehydration of the brain tissue in cats. The specific resistance of the blood also diminished by 20--30% which contributed significantly to increasing of cerebral impedance oscillations. These findings make impedance methods unreliable for evaluation of cerebral circulation during dehydration therapy.

Abstract
  The study was performed on 81 cats with three models of experimental brain oedema: sudden decompression, surgical wound, and cold injury. During the experiments blood pressure, central venous pressure, and intracranial pressure were recorded. The blood-brain-barrier was tested with Evans blue solution. The gray and white matter tissue was sampled at the end of the experiment, and the water content and sodium and potassium concentrations were determined. The animals with the same experimental model were divided into three groups: untreated, treated with the vasoprotective agents, and treated with the protease inhibitor Trasylol. In the sudden decompression model after balloon deflation, white matter haemorrhages and oedema development were found in gray matter and basal nuclei. In animals treated with the vasoprotective drugs, haemorrhages were not observed, and oedematous changes were less pronounced. The Trasylol effect on oedema development was not significant in this model. In the surgical wound model, oedematous changes were observed after 24 hours following the lesion. Oedema occurred in the white matter, as in the animals with cold lesions. In both models--surgical wound and cold lesion--the beneficial effect of Trasylol was shown, while the effect of Aescorin was less evident. The results obtained seemed to testify to the usefulness of both Trasylol and vasoprotective drugs in the prevention and treatment of brain oedema in neurosurgical patients.

Abstract
  The effect of decompressive trepanation was compared to that of surgical resection of the traumatized tissue in the course of traumatic brain edema in standardized experimental brain trauma. Following a right parietal cold injury, the following parameters were monitored continuously in 12 cats: ventricular pressure, epidural pressure over both hemispheres, arterial and central venous pressure and heart rate. The EEG was evaluated continuously, using a computer (power spectra). After catheterization of the superior sagittal sinus, cerebral arteriovenous differences of glucose, lactate, O2 and CO2 were calculated. 6 animals were treated surgically when showing elevated intracranial pressure ICP and markedly altered EEG. In 3 animals, the right hemisphere was decompressed by extensive resection of bone and dura. In 3 further animals, the softened brain tissue of the cold lesion was resected and the skull defect closed. 6 untreated animals were used in controls. A decompression by skull hemiresection for ablation of the injured cortex abolished the high intracranial pressure, but only the latter method seemed to prevent further damage. This could be demonstrated by the EEG registration, and by the normalization of arteriovenous metabolite differences. Only animals treated with edema resection had a normal arousal reaction and survived the trauma. The results indicate, that only an ablation of the local injury will prevent further damage to the brain. After decompressive trepanation alone, the progression of tissue edema is not interrupted. As can be seen from the literature, the poor results obtained even from extensive decompressive operations in traumatic brain edema, indicate that the further development of edema is independent of the intracranial pressure, whereas the favorable results of resection of lobar contusions show an interruption of the spread of dysbolism.

Abstract
  Chronic collections of fluid in the subdural spaces may result from trauma or may complicate meningitis. The etiological factor, or factors, which contribute to chronicity of subdural fluid in children remains obscure. We postulate that one possible mechanism is the progressive stretching and narrowing of the cortical veins, bridging the subarachnoid and subdural spaces to enter the superior sagittal sinus. This process ultimately leads to thrombosis of these 'hanging veins'. Narrowing and angulation of these veins could result in elevated back pressure favoring the formation of a transudate. 16 children who had progressive and persistent collections of xanthochromic fluid in the subdural spaces secondary to trauma or infection who were treated previously either with subdural tap, burr holes, subdural peritoneal shunt, craniotomy, stripping of membranes and/or a combination of these, were treated by lowering and advancing the superior sagittal sinus with its overlying sagittal suture and performing a duraplasty. This new surgical technique is directed to improve venous drainage from the superior anastomotic vein into the superior sagittal sinus. Angiographic follow-up showed that only 2 patients still have evidence of fluid collection: the rest of the patients showed normal arterial phases, the medullary system was minimally filled and all of these showed remarkable improvement of the venous drainage throughout the superficial cortical veins with no evidence of hanging veins. Intellectual development of these children following lowering of the superior sagittal sinus showed that 8 patients (50%) were normal or above normal; 5 patients (31.2%) were retarded and 3 patients (18.7%) were borderline.

Abstract
  The authors studied 10 cats to assess the question of abolition of cerebral autoregulation attendant on the use of nitroprusside for hypotensive anesthesia. After the establishment of stable base line parameters, a continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside was begun in a dose sufficient to maintain a mean systemic arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg. Infusion was continued for incremental periods of 30 seconds to 10 minutes, increasing the time of infusion by 30 seconds after each subsequent trial. At 10 seconds after the cessation of nitroprusside administration, intravenous dopamine was infused to raise the systemic arterial pressure to a mean of 100 mm Hg, and the subsequent response in intracranial pressure was recorded in each instance. In no animal was a loss of cerebral autoregulation noted when the nitroprusside infusion was maintained for 3 minute or less. When the infusion was maintained for 4 minutes or longer, cerebral autoregulation was lost in each animal, and the length of time to return of cerebral autoregulation correlated with the duration of nitroprusside infusion. Sodium nitroprusside disturbs the integrity of cerebral pressure autoregulation, and the onset and extent of this disturbance is a dose-dependent phenomenon.

Abstract
  The pathophysiology of post-cardiac arrest brain damage is not well understood. Many of the model systems presently used to study global ischemia have serious limitations. A new model system for total cerebral ischemia (TCI), using aortic and inferior vena caval occlusion balloons, is described. This model system produces verifiable TCI and avoids surgical invasion of the thorax or the use of vasoactive drugs. It does not impede cerebral venous return and protects the cardiopulmonary system from damage. This model system can be used to study the efficacy of various therapeutic interventions following a standardized CNS global ischemic insult.

Abstract
  The effects of a hyperventilation, positive negative pressure ventilation (PNPV) and ventilation using positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP), on intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured in 24 patients suffering from different neurosurgical disorders. The patients were given a basic anaesthesia including muscle relaxation. The investigations showed, that hyperventilation, followed by a PCO2 of 26 and 30 torr, clearly lowered the intracranial pressure. The pressure drop was much more pronounced when the preexisting ICP was high than when it was low, due to the form of the compliance curve of the brain. PNPV also lowered intracranial pressure, but a harmful effect of this technique on lung function and structure is known. Its use is justified only for short periods and in addition to other measures for lowering ICP. The results also demonstrated that PNPV possesses limited beneficial properties with regard to the subject discussed here. Ventilation by PEEP significantly increased ICP. This technique is to be employed with caution in neurosurgery. Arterial pressure (radial artery) and central venous pressure (subclavian vein) were also recorded.

Abstract
  On the basis of a group of neurosurgical patients showing a differing composition, various procedures of the dehydrating therapy in the pre- and postoperative phases for decreasing the increased intracranial pressure were studied. In addition to the continuous recording of the intracranial pressure, the electrolyte and water balance was measured by recording the plasma, urinary, and cerebrospinal-fluid electrolytes and their osmolarities and the urinary output was determined. Besides, specific measurements of the haematocrit, of the central venous pressure and the arterial mean pressure brought pathophysiological findings on the dehydration. The comparison of conventional substances such as mannite and sorbite of different concentrations per time showed various disturbances of the electrolyte and water balance; therapeutic guiding rules could be elaborated under consideration of these experiences. On the basis of the intracranial pressure/volume relationship, the effectiveness of the dehydration should not only be assessed by the reduction of the intracranial pressure since the extent of the alteration of the electrolyte and water balance and the haemodynamically active changes are quite different. Finally, disease pictures should be taken into consideration in which the basic morphological and functional conditions have been lost and the limits of the therapeutic procedure are exceeded.

Abstract
  Intensive Medicine is always associated with the problem of handling the mass and assuring the quality of information on vital signs, fluid and blood balance, laboratory data, physiological calculations, etc., required in patient care. A computer based monitoring system for intensive care was introduced in 1973 at the Academic Hospital in Leuven. The basic software was developed at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital of the Harvard Medical School and the medical division of the Hewlett Packard Company; the computer used was a H.P. 2100 central processor with 32K of core memory. Initially, the program allowed mainly acquisition, storage and retrieval of bedside monitored and manual data of cardiac and circulatory function. Very soon however, the software was extended and modified by the division of "Medical Informatics" in order to meet new or different requirements. In the present situation our vision on the use of computer-assisted monitoring has changed and our present program has been extended as follows : 1. On-line collection and retrieval of bedside monitored data including heart rate, arterial blood pressure (systolic-diastolic-mean) left atrial pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, intracranial pressure. Trend analysis of those data, with calculation of mean values, standard variation and corresponding t-tests. 2. Computer assistance in performing time consuming calculations on off-line data such as : -- clearance-values (renal function), -- temperature-correction of blood-gasvalues, -- hour-to-hour fluid balance, including calculation of in-sensible losses, -- blood-balance. 3. Data transmission of laboratory results as soon as available in the central laboratory through a direct link between laboratory and I.T.U. 4. Computer assisted E.C.G. analysis. The three first objectives are realised, on-line E.C.G.-analysis is being developed. The same computer serves the remotely located medical and coronary care units and one bed in the emergency department. An assessment of computer assistance in intensive therapy, on nursing labor and on quality of patient care is made.

Abstract
  The effect of haemodilution with Dextran 60 on experimental cerebral oedema produced by the modified method of Ishii, Hayner, Kelly & Evans (1959) is described. The intracranial pressure was measured from the cisterna magna or epidurally in the parieto-occipital region. In the group of cats subjected to haemodilution, with a haematocrit of 27.20 +/- 1.48%, the intracranial pressure first increased by 500% and, after 1.5 h, began to fall gradually so that at the end of the experiment it was only 160% of initial value. In the other experimental group in which haemodilution with a haematocrit of 27.40 +/- 1.14% was started after 6 h of the experiment, the intracranial pressure gradually fell for the next 6 h from 350% of initial value of 200% of initial value after 12 h. It was concluded that haemodilution slows down the development of cerebral oedema, and can be employed in the treatment of fully developed oedema.

Abstract
  A child developed progressive communicating nonobstructive hydrocephalus as a result of increased intracranial venous pressure. The child had been treated for congenital heart disease at age 3 weeks by surgical creation of an anastomosis between his superior vena cava and right pulmonary artery. Although his cardiac symptoms were alleviated, intracranial venous hypertension resulted, giving rise to progressive head enlargement and other signs of hydrocephalus. Postmortem examination at age 3 years disclosed no other lesions that could have caused the hydrocephalus. Increased intracranial venous pressure can lead to either pseudotumor cerebri or hydrocephalus, the former in children 3 years or older, the latter in infants 18 months or less. Possible mechanisms accounting for these differences are discussed.

Abstract
  Sodium nitroprusside (Nipride) was used in 35 patients between 16 and 72 years for induced hypotension. The fast and dose-dependent effect on the smooth muscles of the vessels made it superior to other methods of lowering blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside was used to achieve hypotension in 11 patients (group I) with an aneurysm of a cerebral vessel and in 16 patients (group II) with highly vascularized cerebral tumors. In 8 patients (group III) from the neurosurgical intensive care unit a hypertensive crisis was interrupted. 10 patients (group IV) without induced hypotension were used as controls to compare the action of our standardized method of anesthesia on the observed parameters of blood pressure lowering. The average dose of sodium nitroprusside was 2.74 mcg/kg/min. in group I, 1.77 mcg/kg/min in group II and 1.27 mcg/kg/min in group III. The initial blood pressure was lowered between 30--40% in the mean in all 3 groups. Careful monitoring of the intra-arterial blood pressure, the central venous pressure, the cerebral fluid pressure, the arterial blood gases and the function of the kidneys during and after induced hypotension with sodium nitroprusside made it possible to take advantage of the blood pressure lowering effect also in patients with increased intracranial pressure.

Abstract
  Seven children studied because of clinical macrocephaly and suspected hydrocephalus ultimately proved to have megalencephaly apparently due to an increase in sagittal sinus venous pressure as established from infusion studies. Unexplainably, these patients were all males. All were seen initially between 2 and 8 months of age. Head enlargement exceeded two standard deviations in all seven. Pneumoencephalography, ventriculography, or computerized tomography demonstrated normal or minimally enlarged ventricles that did not progress in size. Isotope cisternography was abnormal. Studies of CSF formation and absorption demonstrated normal absorption rates but high calculated sagittal sinus pressures. Though therapy was usually not required, in one unusual infant, severe progressive macrocephaly with minimal hydrocephalus required a shunt. Another had a transient episode of acute hydrocephalus associated with a low CSF absorption rate and ventricular enlargement. In this report, we review the intracranial hydrodynamics of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH), communicating hydrocephalus, and the pathogenesis of megalencephaly. Benign intracranial hypertension and the type of megalencephaly demonstrated by our patients appear to develop similarly except that the presence of open cranial sutures may allow a transient nonhydrostatic loading of brain parenchyma in infants, resulting in mild, nonprogressive macrocephaly.

Abstract
  Because of the ability of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to dilate cerebral blood vessels, intracranial pressure (ICP) should increase with its use. In patients with vascular intracranial tumors following SNP (0.01%) infusion, ICP increased from 14.58 +/- 1.85 to 27.61 +/- 3.33 torr (p greater than 0.0005) and cerebral perfusion pressure decreased from 89.32 +/- 3.5 to 43.23 +/- 4.60 torr (p less than 0.0005) when the mean arterial pressure had reduced by 33%. These results suggest that SNP not be used in patients with raised ICP unless previous measures have been taken to improve intracranial compliance.

  Some of the important points of view of anesthesia in pediatric neurosurgery are: adequate alveolar exchange of oxygen and carbondioxide by means of artificial ventilation; stable cardiovascular function; fluid balance; monitoring, and attempts to keep intracranial pressure low. This last point is achieved by various anesthesiological procedures, e.g., hyperventilation, positive-negative pressure ventilation, rapid induction of anesthesia and choice of suitable anesthetics. Enflurane (Ethrane) increases intracranial pressure less than halothane. The new intravenous anesthetic etomidate lowers intracranial pressure in a favorable manner quite similar to thiopental (Pentothal-Sodium).

Abstract
  Large congenital arachnoid cysts are a rare cause of increased intracranial pressure and progressive neurologic deficits in adult life. We describe two patients, diagnosed by computerized axial tomography and surgically treated. The pertinent medical literature was reviewed. The outer cyst membranes were excised, and a communication between cyst and subarachnoid space was established. When possible, the membranes and fluid content of these lesions should be studied. This fluid is best obtained by aspiration prior to dural incision. At present, three etiologic mechanisms of cyst enlargement appear tenable: (1) secretion of fluid by ependymal cells, (2) fluid ingress due to an osmotic gradient, and finally, (3) trapping of fluid by a ball-valve mechanism. Regardless of the reasons why these lesions enlarge, drainage of cyst content into the venous system warrants a clinical consideration.

Abstract
  Pressure measured in teh epidural space of 50 dogs was consistently negative (subatmospheric). Acutely implanted epidural catheters gave an average reading of -2.72 mmHg (n = 44, SE = 0.18), whereas chronically implanted catheters gave more negative readings, averaging -5.8 mmHg (n = 6, SE = 0.49). Since the chronically implanted catheters permit healing, resolution of hemorrhage, and resealing of the epidural space to take place, resulting in equilibration of microcirulatory forces, these readings are believed to represent more closely the true epidural pressure. Also these results approximate closely the calculated and measured interstitial fluid pressures obtained by different techniques in other loose areolar connective tissue systems. Compliance studies, using a double-lumen catheter for simultaneous recording and infusing in the epidural space, showed increasing compliance as the pressure rose into the positive pressure range, with an eventual plateau of the volume-pressure curve at the level of the concomitantly measured cerebrospinal fluid pressure (avg = +5.73 mmHg, n = 10, SE = 0.48). Intravenous volume loading using Tyrode solution caused a large rise in epidural pressure, and volume depletion with diuretics caused a significant drop in epidural pressure.

Abstract
  The effect of a new, powerful diuretic on biochemical parameters, urine output, central venous pressure, blood pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid pressure in patients with supratentorial intracerebral tumors who showed signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure was tested. When compared to an untreated control group and to the steady-state data of each patient, CSF pressure was significantly reduced using a dose of 240 mg of the diuretic. The 120 mg dosage did not produce significant results. Normalization of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure was not completely obtained using either dose. Used alone, this substance is not suitable for treatment of increased intracranial pressure due to brain edema in patients with intra-cerebral tumors. It might, however, be useful in combination with other medications.

Abstract
  Hypoxic pulmonary disorders and head injuries associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) frequently co-exist. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improves hypoxemia but has been reported to impede cerebral venous return, potentially causing a further increase in ICP. This study examined the effects of PEEP on ICP at different levels of brain compliance. continuous ICP recordings were obtained after insertion of Scott cannulas to the lateral ventricles of seven comatose patients. Brain compliance was assessed by calculation of the pressure volume index. Patients were maintained in a 30 degrees head-up position. Maintenance of PEEP to levels of 40 cm H2O pressure for as long as 18 hours did not increase ICP in patients with either normal or low intracranial compliance, and did not increase ICP in the absence of pulmonary disease. Central venous pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure increased proportionately as PEEP was increased. No consistent changes were found in blood pressure recordings, nor were there any reductions in cardiac output found during the studies. Abrupt discontinuation of PEEP did not result in increased ICP except for a transient rise on two occasions when respiratory secretions became copious and the patients were inadequately ventilated. Improved oxygenation in two patients as a result of PEEP was concomitant with improved intracranial compliance and neurological status. In patients with brain injuries, PEEP improves arterial oxygenation without increasing ICP as previously supposed. Consequently, PEEP is a valuable form of therapy for the comatose patient with pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.

Abstract
  THsi study was designed to define the effect of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation on intracranial pressure (ICP). In 25 patients with severe head trauma with and without associated pulmonary injury the following parameters were simultaneously monitored under mechanical ventilation with and without PEEP:ICP, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, arterial blood gases, and cardiac rate. In addition, the volume-pressure response (VPR) was evaluted in each patient to assess cerebral elastance. The results indicate a significant increase in ICP with the application of PEEP only in the 12 patients who manifested increased cerebral elastance by VPR. Half of this latter group manifested impairment of cerebral perfusion pressure to levels less than 60 mm Hg. Return to baseline CIP levels was observed with termination of PEEP. No significantly consistent changes in other parameters were noted.

Abstract
  The pulmonary vascular response to intracranial hypertension was studied in anesthetized controlled ventilated dogs in which intracranial pressure (ICP) was elevated to 20 Torr below the mean arterial pressure for a 20-min period, and regulated at this level. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased from control value of 2.7 +/- 0.30 to 8.3 +/- 0.51 Torr-l-1-min at the end of 20-min increase in ICP. The increase in PVR was associated with marked increase (P less than 0.001) in pulmonary arterial pressure from 14.4 +/- 1.3 to 35.4 +/- 4.0 Torr, small increase in left atrial pressure from 5.4 +/- 1.2 to 7.9 +/- 1.9 Torr, and no significant change in pulmonary blood flow. The increase in PVR occurred independently of changes in the arterial pressure. The increase in PVR induced by elevated ICP was correlated with increases in lung water, physiological shunt (Qs/Qt), alveolar dead space (VD), and with hypoxemia. Pretreatment with propranolol (1.5 mg-kg-1) attenuated the increase in PVR during elevation in ICP; the smaller increase in PVR was associated with a marked increase in left atrial pressure and a smaller increase in pulmonary perfusion pressure than in the control group. The propranolol-treated dogs also developed increases in lung water, Qs/Qt, VD, and hypoxemia. In contrast, pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (1.5 mg-kg-1) inhibited the increases in pulmonary perfusion pressure and PVR induced by ICP elevation as well as the associated increases in lung water, Qs/Qt, VD, and hypoxemia. Therefore, a sustained elevation in ICP at a level below the mean arterial pressure in the intact dog evokes pulmonary vasoconstriction which is mediated by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms. The neurogenic pulmonary vasoconstriction results in the increases in lung water, Qs/Qt, VD, and in the hypoxemia.

Abstract
  Disturbances of CSF circulation arise from the anatomic narrows of the CSF spaces and from the dependence on venous pressure of CSF absorption in the superior sagittal sinus. The author discusses the modern concepts of CSF production and circulation, the causal mechanism for hydrocephalus and the chances of compensating for a rise in CSF pressure by transependymal migration. CSF circulation (CSFc) disturbances can be subdivided into primary processes arising in the internal and external CSF spaces and secondary which are due to distant consequences of intracranial processes via interaction of the blood/CSF volume and parenchyma of the brain within the closed capsule of the skull according to the teaching of Monroe-Kellie. Extra-cranial processes in the neck, the mediastinum and heart are primary CSFc disturbances which-via an increase in intracranial venous pressure-lead to a reduction of CSF absorption. Among the hypotonic CSFc disturbances loss of CSF volume due to fistulae, diagnostic or surgical measures are the most important. 205 cases from the literature are the basis of a description of the clinical picture, the main subjective symptoms and neurologic signs. The problems of diagnosis of CSFc disturvances are demonstrated on 3 cases from the author's department. They were due to a colloid cyst of the foramen of Monroe, a stenosis of the aqueduct and a "normal pressure hydrocephalus". The relative value of additional technical investigations into the diagnosis of CSFc disturbances is assessed critically. The techniques of PEG, ventriculography and radioisotope cisterno- and ventriculography are compared and their special indications determined. Treatment of hypotonic CSFc disturbances is surgical revision and/or an atrio-ventricular shunt. Conservative measures only effect postponement. Treatment of hypotonic CSFc disturbances for which loss of CSF volume cannot be established, has so far had only unsatisfactory results.

Abstract
  UNLABELLED: There are many problems about the cause, pathophysiology and treatment of acute brain swelling under intracranial hypertension frequently encountered in the neurosurgical clinics. Generally, rapid increase of the cerebral vasoparesis caused by unknown etiology is thought to be the main cause of acute brain swelling under intracranial hypertension. Moreover, disturbance of the cerebral venous circulatory system is discussed recently by many authors. But, research from the point of systemic respiration and hemodynamics is necessary for resolving these problems. This experiment was designed to study the effects of respiration and hemodynamics on the cerebral vasoparesis.

   METHOD: Using 22 adult dogs, acute intracranial hypertension was produced by epidural balloon inflation sustained at the level of 300 - 400 mmH2O. Simultaneously with measurement of intracranial pressure at the epidural space, superior sagittal sinus pressure, respirogram, systemic blood pressure (femoral artery), central venous pressure, common carotid blood flow, EKG and bipolar lead EEG were monitored continuously. The experimental group was divided by the respiratory loading into 5 groups as follows: control (6 cases), 10% CO2 hypercapnia (4 cases), 10% O2 hypoxia (4 cases), stenosis of airway (5 cases), 100% O2-controled respiration (3 cases).

   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: 1) Cerebral vasoparesis under acute intracranial hypertension took place earlier and showed more rapid progression in groups of stenosis of airway, hypercapnia and hypoxia than control group of spontaneous respiration in room air. No occurrence of cerebral vasoparesis was found out in a group of 100% O2 controlled respiration. It is proved that increased airway resistance or asphyxia, hypercapnia and hypoxia have strictly reference to the occurrence and progression of cerebral vasoparesis and for the prevention of cerebral vasoparesis, correct 100% O2 cont rolled respiration is effective. 2) From the hemodynamic change, the progression of rapid increase of cerebral blood volume with increase of blood volume in the superior sagitta sinus during cerebral vasoparesis under intracranial hypertension is presumed. It is suggested from the superior sagittal sinus pressure in various experimental groups that the site, reactivity and disturbed degree of the cerebral venous system are changed by the difference of respiratory or ventrilatory state and the cerebral venous circulatory disturbance has also reference to the occurrence of acute brain swelling. 3) During cerebral vasopareris under acute intracranial hypertension, remarkable supression of respiration, increased central venous pressure and increased common carotid blood flow were observed. It is concluded that the reaction of systemic hemodynamics following respiratory change effects on cerebral circulation markedly and they are being important factors to occurrence of acute brain swelling.

Abstract
  Thirty-three dogs were anesthetized, laminectomized in the lower thoracic, upper lumbar region, and exposed to simulated 220 ft air dives of 5 to 60 minutes. Cinephotomicrography of the epidural vertebral venous system and dorsal pial vessels was done predive and postdive. The epidural vertebral venous system became blocked by bubbles in 24 animals. Eighteen animals evaluated for clinical and/or pathologic signs of cord damage all manifested positive signs. In 10 dives made by eight dogs, epidural vertebral venous system obstruction did not occur, and signs of cord damage were absent after nine of these dives. After one dive, a dog manifested cervical cord damage remote to the region of epidural vertebral venous system under observation. Acute pulmonary hypertension and central venous congestion were not essential prerequisites for epidural vertebral venous system occlusion to occur. These experiments permit further analysis of the pathogenesis of spinal cord damage in decompression sickness.

Abstract
  The effect of ethanol on the cerebro-spinal fluid pressure of six baboons is described. A biphasic response is shown to the intravenous infusion with a mean pressure fall of 3.1 mmHg. It is suggested that both the diuretic effect and the effect of alcohol on cerebral blood flow may be factors involved in the pressure fall.

Abstract
  Neurosurgical patients, whether injured or not, have benefited in recent years from a new technique of supervision, measurement of thr intracranial pressure (ICP). Thus, measurement of a pressure figure and its course, gives precious information, both diagnostic and therapeutic. Various techniques of measurement are now proposed. We chose, for special reasons, measurement of the ICP within the ventricle. A catheter is introduced into the ventricle through a trephine hole. It is linked by a liquid column to a recording system (cathode oscilloscope, ink writer or magnetic tape). A slow inscriber permits continuous recording of the ICP for several days or even weeks. In view of the narrow dependency of the ICP on other physiological parameters, it seemed to us essential to record simultaneously 5 other parameters, the temperature, the blood pressure, the central venous pressure, the heart rate and the respiratory ventilation, by measurement of FeCO2 (capnography). Several forms of treatment have been proposed to bring down a raised ICP (greater than 15 mm Hg), e.g. osmotic diuresis, hyperventilation, corticosteroid therapy. Removal of CSF by ventriculalar catheter, sometimes permits one to pass over the critical period. It was in this background that we attempted to analyse the effect of neuroleptics on the ICP, without attempting to explain their mechanism of action. Our study was of 10 patients with cranial trauma, of both sexes, aged from 14 to 60 years. The intracranial pressure was measured within the ventricle and correlated with the other physiological parameters. When the ICP was normal, e.g. primary lesion of the brain stem, administration of neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine 100 mg IV/24 hours, or levopromazine 50 mg IV/24 hours, does not modify the value of the ICP. On the other hand, in the case of raised intracranial pressure due to contusion with cerebral oedema, for example, the administration of neuroleptic drugs seems to provide a very slight reduction in this pressure. It would be interesting to measure, at the same time as the ICP, the cerebral blood flow.

Abstract
  Seven patients with intracranial disorders were studied during recovery from anaesthesia with nitrous oxide and halothane. Arterial, intracranial, and central venous pressure, and arterial carbon dioxide tension were measured and compared with the patient's clinical state. No patient had evidence of increased brain volume when the dura was closed. All had been hyperventilated during the surgical procedure. Cessation of hyperventilation and the continued administration of anaesthetics was followed by a moderate increase in intracranial pressure and a reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure, but critically low values were not seen. Spontaneous respiration returned when the PaCO2 was in the range of 33-51 mm Hg. When spontaneous respiration was judged to be normal, anaesthesia was interrupted and the endotracheal tube was removed. In the following minutes, until the patients were awake, the intracranial pressure decreased to normal or near normal values, with minimal change in PaCO2. In these seven patients in whom there were no signs of brain swelling, the skull was closed, the patients were allowed to resume spontaneous respiration, and anaesthesia was terminated without major changes in intracranial pressure or cerebral perfusion pressure. However, hyperventilation is advocated after operation in patients with marked brain swelling.

Abstract
  A shift of blood into the head during negative pressure aspiration of subdural haematomas in an infant has been demonstrated, and also that aspiration may restart bleeding. An estimate of the elasticity of a 47 cm circumference skull has been obtained. It is suggested that the observed changes in distribution of blood are sufficient to explain the occasional deaths of infants after aspiration of subdural haematomas and that so-called "brain stem shock" need not be invoked.

Abstract
  By employing continual electromamometry of the cerebrospinal fluid and central venous pressures the influence of nitrous oxide on the CSE pressure was studied in neurosurgical patients operated upon following pneumoencephalography. In patients treated surgically without any preliminary pneumoencephalographic investigation the normo- and hypocapnic artificial ventilation of the lungs with a N2O and O2 mixture produced a significant drop of the CSF pressure. A nitrous oxide anesthesia applied to the patients operated on after pneumoencephalography was accompanied by a marked rise of the cerebrospinal fluid tension. In such cases an artificial hyperventilation of the lungs failed to prevent a rise of the intracranial tension.

Abstract
  "Contre-coup" lesions occurring particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes following head injury have been claimed to be caused by sudden negative pressure transients, as part of the "contre-coup" end pressures occurring in the brain tissue at an occipital impact. With a new experimental model such impact acceleration pressure (near-1 atm) could be generated in the rabbit brain through a parietal opening. Resulting morphological changes were evaluated with various microscopical methods, including Evan's blue-albumin technique for observations on vascular permeability changes. Regardless of the magnitude of the negative pressure transients no changes characteristic of "contre-coup" lesions were seen in temporal lobes, i.e. in areas where preparative artefacts are absent in control animals. Therefore such negative pressure transients per se do not appear to be of major importance for the development of contre-coup lesions. However, vascular permeability changes were frequently observed in the brain stem and upper cervical cord and are presumably related to the flow of tissue in the cranio-spinal junction.

Abstract
  The effect of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine on the cerebral circulation was studied in the dog, anaesthetized with chloralose, by recording the intracranial venous pressure and the venous outflow from the superior cerebral vein. Under optimal experimental conditions, ergotamine (5 to 10 mug./kg.) and dihydroergotamine (100 mug./kg.) gave a marked and long-lasting cerebral vasoconstriction accompanied by a slight hypertension. The cerebral vasoconstriction provoked by ergotamine may be very small and was sometimes absent when the cerebral blood-flow was low. This vasoconstrictor effect is more pronounced the higher the initial intracranial venous pressure and hence the cerebral blood-flow. After the induction of a cerebral vasodilatation by 48/80 or strychnine, the vasoconstrictor action of ergotamine was more pronounced. The effect was not observed when CO(2) was employed to modify the intracranial venous pressure. Simultaneous registration of the cerebral, nasal cavity, and kidney vascular responses demonstrated the relative specificity of the action of ergotamine on the cerebral vessels. The small doses of ergotamine used may weaken or abolish the vasoconstrictor action of adrenaline on cerebral vessels. The modification of the responses of the cerebral circulation which such factors as anaesthesia, respiratory acidosis, and operative trauma can produce have been confirmed and emphasized. The results support the view that the vasoconstrictor action of ergotamine on the cerebral vessels might account for the therapeutic value of this drug in migraine.

Abstract
  Headache is the commonest complication of spinal puncture. There is no significant difference in the incidence of headache after lumbar puncture, whether or not the puncture is followed by injection of an anesthetic agent. The sequence of events leading to postlumbar puncture headaches is probably (1) decreased volume of cerebrospinal fluid with lowered pressure; (2) increased differential between the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid and the intracranial venous pressure; (3) dilation of venous structures with increase in brain volume; and (4) production of tension on the pain sensitive areas in the cranium. Prevention of postlumbar puncture headache consists largely in attempts to avoid the development of the pressure differential between that of the cerebrospinal fluid and intracranial venous pressure. Treatment consists of analgesics, hydration and attempts to restore normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure.
