TI Sickle cell disease and internal cerebral vein thrombosis.
SO ANNALES FRANCAISES D ANESTHESIE ET DE REANIMATION
AB Cerebrovascular disorders are frequently associated with sickle cell disease, mainly in homozygous children. We report the case a 25-old-patient with known sickle cell disease who presented with coma inaugurated by manifestations of intracranial hypertension. CT revealed bilateral thalamic infarcts and angiography confirmed the thrombosis of internal cerebral veins. Treatment included heparin and blood transfusion. Severe cerebral oedema resulted in the lethal outcome three days later.

TI Venous hypertension and craniosynostosis
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Introduction: This article addresses the relevance of venous hypertension to children born with, in particular, the "syndromic" forms of craniosynostosis. The development of the human cerebral venous system is summarised and the patterns of anomalous venous drainage seen in children with complex forms of craniosynostosis associated with raised intracranial pressure are described. Aetology: The aetiology of these abnormal patterns is discussed under the general headings of "The constriction theory", "A primary role for FGFR mutations" and "Persistence of the foetal pattern of intracranial venous drainage."Venous hypertension (along with hydrocephalus, cranio-cerebral disproportion and airway obstruction) has an important role in the aetiology of raised intracranial pressure in severely affected children. Treatment: The inter-relationship between these factors is explained and then the treatment of those children whose raised intracranial pressure is considered to be due predominantly to venous hypertension is described.

TI Endovascular Treatment of Acute Thrombosis of Cerebral Veins and Sinuses
SO NEURORADIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Acute thrombosis of cerebral veins and sinuses (ATCVS) is a multifactorial disease with grave consequences. Because of its rare occurrence there are no proven treatment guidelines. Sixteen patients with ATCVS were treated. The final diagnosis was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography. Sinus catheterization was performed via transfemoral venous access. Treatment included mechanical manipulation of thrombi and thrombolytic therapy. A regression of clinical symptoms with a concomitant decrease of intracranial hypertension was achieved in all patients. Long-term results were studied in eight patients: none presented clinical signs of intracranial hypertension. Endovascular transvenous recanalization is an effective treatment for acute thrombosis of cerebral veins and sinuses. Along with the local thrombolysis, significant potential in the treatment of this complex pathology lies in the transvenous endovascular techniques of mechanical thrombus extraction, especially in patients with intracranial hemorrhage for whom the use of thrombolytic agents is restricted.

TI INVIVO EFFECTS OF ALPHA-ADRENOCEPTOR AGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS ON PIAL
   VEINS OF CATS
SO STROKE
AB Cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure may be modified by influences on cerebral veins. The known adrenergic innervation of cerebral veins and their sensitivity to norepinephrine raised the question, whether pial veins can be selected influenced through adrenoceptors in vivo. Therefore, alpha1 and alpha2 adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists were locally injected into the perivascular space of pial veins using the microapplication technique. The alpha1 and alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonists, prazosin and yohimbine, had only minor effects on pial veins. Both antagonists blocked constrictions induced by norepinephrine (10-5M) in a concentration dependent manner (10-7-10-4M). The alpha1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine caused significant (10-7-10-3M) constriction of pial veins, with a maximum of 11.6% of initial diameter at 10-3M. Oxymetazoline, an alpha2 receptor agonist, induced a significant constriction only at 10-3M (5.1%). Since both alpha1 and  alpha2 adrenoceptor agonists are less potent constrictors of pial veins than norepinephrine in vivo, a preferential use of alpha1 or alpha2 adrenoceptor agonists cannot be recommended from these experiments, if a therapeutic reduction of intracranial pressure or blood volume is desired.

TI Hypothyroidism and cerebral vein thrombosis - a possible association
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB Background There are many systemic illnesses that constitute risk factors for cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT). Hypothyroidism was never associated with CVT, despite growing evidence supporting a possible etiopathogenic link. We report two patients with CVT in whom hypothyroidism was concomitantly diagnosed. Clinical cases Cases were women 21 and 52 years old. They both presented with intracranial hypertension syndrome and symptomatic focal epilepsy. CVT was diagnosed with MRI and MR venography. Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in the acute phase of CVT. Both had an autoimmune thyroiditis. None of the patients had diffuse goitre. Other risk factors for CVT were oral contraceptives and elevated homocysteine in one and hormonal replacement therapy in the other. Both were treated with anticoagulation, anti-epileptic drugs and thyroid replacement therapy, with good clinical outcome. Conclusions The association found between untreated hypothyroidism and CVT in these patients may result from chance. However, several haemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters have been demonstrated to be disturbed in hypothyroidism suggesting a possible role of this disease in CVT pathogenesis. In addition, indirect evidence also supports possible endothelial dysfunction and venous stasis in hypothyroidism, further emphasizing the physiopathological link between the two conditions. More research is needed to determine a possible causal role of hypothyroidism on CVT. We suggest that thyroid function should be included in the usual workup of CVT patients.

TI Thrombosis of the great cerebral vein in a hemodialysis patient
SO HEMODIALYSIS INTERNATIONAL
AB Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare condition with various clinical presentations which may delay diagnosis. It is frequently associated with severe consequences. We present the first documented case of thrombosis of the great cerebral vein in a hemodialysis patient. A 29-year-old female patient with end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology was admitted to a hospital with altered consciousness and nausea. Severe headache in the right parietal area had started 2 days before. On examination, she was in the poor overall condition, dysartric, with a severe nystagmus. Urgent brain multislice computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed thrombosis of the great cerebral vein with hypodense zones in hypothalamus, thalamus and basal ganglia. She was treated with heparin bolus of 25000 IU with a favorable outcome. Detailed examination demonstrated increased lupus anticoagulant (LA) 1 and LA2 and increased LA1/LA2. Control magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 year later revealed multiple vascular lesions within the brain. Acetylsalicylate was introduced in therapy. Thrombosis of the cerebral veins should be suspected in patients with end-stage renal disease, altered neurological status and signs of increased intracranial pressure.

TI Immediate Transfer for Clot Extraction in a Young Woman With Leukemia
   and Asparaginase-Associated Acute Cerebral Vein Thrombosis
SO NEUROHOSPITALIST
AB We present the case of an 18-year-old woman with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed hemorrhagic stroke and epilepsia partialis continua due to acute cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT). The patient had 10 risk factors for CVT (including use of asparaginase chemotherapy for the ALL) and also unfortunately had 4 biomarkers for poor prognosis for outcome post-CVT diagnosis. Immediate transfer to a Comprehensive Stroke Center allowed for hyperacute neurointerventional clot extraction with rapid restoration of the patency of the superior sagittal sinus. This resulted in an unexpectedly favorable neurological outcome and simultaneously allowed for early resumption of chemotherapy for ALL after only a 5-day hiatus. Our case highlights the importance of immediate transfer of highest risk patients with multiple biomarkers for poor prognosis to a Comprehensive Stroke Center with endovascular and neurosurgical capabilities and the possibility of overcoming the odds of a poor outcome with venous clot extraction if medical management fails. Neurological deterioration due to escalating intracranial pressure with impending herniation may occur rapidly, and treatment at such facilities can be life-saving.

TI Lower body negative pressure reduces jugular and portal vein volumes and
   counteracts the elevation of middle cerebral vein velocity during
   long-duration spaceflight
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Cephalad fluid shifts in space have been hypothesized to cause the spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) by increasing the intracranial-ocular translaminal pressure gradient. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) can be used to shift upper-body blood and other fluids toward the legs during spaceflight. We hypothesized that microgravity would increase jugular vein volume (JVvol), portal vein cross-sectional area (PV), and intracranial venous blood velocity (MCV) and that LBNP application would return these variables toward preflight levels. Data were collected from 14 subjects (11 males) before and during long-duration International Space Station (ISS) spaceflights. Ultrasound measures of JVvol, PV, and MCV were acquired while seated and supine before flight and early during spaceflight at day 45 (FD45) and late at day 150 (FD150) with and without LBNP. JVvol increased from preflight supine and seated postures (46 +/- 48% and 646 +/- 595% on FD45 and 43 +/- 43% and 702 +/- 631% on FD150, P < 0.05), MCV increased from preflight supine (44 +/- 31% on FD45 and 115 +/- 116% on FD150, P < 0.05), and PV increased from preflight supine and seated (51 +/- 56% on FD45 and 100 +/- 74% on FD150, P < 0.05). lnflight LBNP of 25 mmHg restored JVvol and MCV to preflight supine level and PV to preflight seated level. Elevated JVvol confirms the sustained neck-head blood engorgement inflight, whereas increased PV area supports the fluid shift at the splanchnic level. Also, MCV increased potentially due to reduced lumen diameter. LBNP, returning variables to preflight levels, may be an effective countermeasure.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Microgravity-induced fluid shifts markedly enlarge jugular and portal veins and increase cerebral vein velocity. These findings demonstrate a marked flow engorgement at neck and splanchnic levels and may suggest compression of the cerebral veins by the brain tissue in space. LBNP (-25 mmHg for 30 min) returns these changes to preflight levels and, thus, reduces the associated flow and tissue disturbances.

TI Cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis in elderly patients
SO STROKE
AB Backgound and Purpose - The clinical features and prognosis of cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis (CVT) in elderly patients have not been previously described.
   Methods - In a multicenter prospective observational study, we compared clinical and imaging features, risk factors, and outcome of adult patients aged <65 (young and middle-aged patients) and >= 65 years (elderly patients).
   Results - A total of 624 adult patients with CVT were registered and followed-up for a median of 16 months. Fifty-one (8.2%) were aged >= 65 years. Presentation as an isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome was less frequent in elderly patients (4/51 versus 139/573, P=0.008), whereas depressed consciousness (17 versus 97, P=0.005), and mental status changes (22 versus 115, P=0.001) were more frequent in the elderly. The prognosis of elderly patients was considerably worse than that of younger patients, as only 49% of elderly patients made a complete recovery (versus 82% in younger patients), whereas 27% died and 22% were dependent at the end of follow-up (versus 7 and 2% respectively in younger patients). Carcinoma (5 cases) was more frequent as a risk factor for CVT in elderly patients (P=0.017). During follow-up, elderly patients were more likely to experience thrombotic events (HR=4.8, 95% CI=1.9 to 11.9) and were less likely to experience severe headaches (HR=0.2, 95% CI=0.02, 0.97).
   Conclusions - Elderly patients with CVT have a distinctive clinical presentation: isolated intracranial hypertension is uncommon, whereas mental status and alertness disturbances are common. The prognosis of CVT is worse in elderly patients.

SO RECENT ADVANCES AND CONTROVERSIES IN GAMMA KNIFE NEUROSURGERY
SE Progress in Brain Research
AB Dural Arteriovenous Malformations (DAVFs) are rare vascular malformations involving the dura and cerebral veins. They occur in a variety of locations but in general the cavernous sinus lesion is more frequent among Asian patients while the transverse sinus is more usual among western patients. Treatments include microsurgery, endovascular embolization and GKNS. The dangerous concomitant of DAVFs is retrograde flow into the cerebral veins (CVR). Patients with CVR are at risk for bleeding, neurological deficit and in some cases death. They require treatment with the aim of occluding the fistula. Patients without CVR may or may not require therapy, depending on the severity of the symptoms associated with the fistula. These patients require reduction of symptoms more than occlusion. GKNS may often be associated with embolization.

AB There is insufficient information on the prognosis and safety of anticoagulation in acute cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis (CVDST). To describe the clinical aspects and medical management of CVDST in Portuguese hospitals, to evaluate the safety of anticoagulation in this setting, and to identify subgroups of CVDST patients with different prognoses, we registered symptomatic CVDST patients admitted to Portuguese hospitals since 1980, Cases were collected from file review up to 6/95 and from consecutively admitted patients from 6/95 to 6/98, One hundred and forty-two patients were included from 20 centers (51 retrospectively and 91 prospectively). One hundred and twelve patients (79%) were anticoagulated. There were only 6 new intracranial hemorrhages (4 in anticoagulated patients) and 2 systemic hemorrhages, Nine (6%) patients died. At discharge, 96 [68%), had recovered completely and only 6 (4%) were dependent (Rankin greater than or equal to 3). Significant multivariate predictors of death/dependency were central nervous system infection as a predisposing cause (odds ratio, OR = 15.4; 95% confidence interval Cl = 111-1.1), encephalopathy on admission (OR = 5.2; 95% Cl = 18.7-1.5) and hemorrhage on admission CT/MR (OR = 3.6; 95% Cl = 12.9-1). Significant predictors of complete recovery were no encephalopathy on admission (OR = 5; 95% Cl = 12.5-2.1), age <45 years (OR = 3.8; 95% Cl = 9.2-1.6) and anticoagulation (OR = 3.8; 95% Cl = 9.6-1.5). It is possible to identify CVDST patients with potential bad or good prognosis in the acute phase.

TI Venous Infarcts in Young Adults
SO CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA IN YOUNG ADULTS: PATHOGENIC AND CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES
SE Neurology Laboratory and Clinical Research Series
AB Thrombosis of the dural sinus and cerebral veins (CVT) are an uncommon cause of stroke in the young adult, accounting for less than 5% of the cases in most series. CVT predominantly affect young females and are associated with oral contraceptive use, pregnancy and puerperium, genetic and acquired prothrombotic conditions such as the antiphospholipid syndrome, and several other systemic conditions. The confirmation of the diagnosis of CVT and venous infarct is based on MRI, including T2*SE sequences combined with MR-venography. In half of the young adults with CVT a venous infarct is present in the admission CT or MRI. Venous infarcts are often multiple, and they can be combined with hemorrhagic lesions. They may undergo hemorrhagic transformation or disappear in subsequent scans. Venous infarcts are due to increased venous and capillary pressure with blood-brain barrier disruption, vasogenic oedema, venous hemorrhage and eventually decreased perfusion pressure with infarct. The most corm-non clinical presentation in young patients with venous infarcts is a combination of headache with a focal syndrome (motor deficit, aphasia) with or without seizures. Mental status disturbances and decreased alertness are present in about 1/4 of these patients. The prognosis of patients with venous infarcts is similar to that of CVT subjects without venous infarcts, with complete recovery in 87%, but with 7% mortality.
   Treatment of venous infarcts includes treatment of the underlying condition, antithrombotic treatment (heparin followed by oral anti coagulants), treatment of intracranial hypertension and of infarcts producing impending herniation, and treatment and prevention of seizures.

AB Benign intracranial hypertension is known to be associated with obesity, endocrine abnormalities, various medications, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. We report a patient presenting with headaches and vomiting attributed to benign intracranial hypertension. The diagnostic work-up revealed Langerhans' cell histiocytosis of the occipital bone. There was no evidence for cerebral vein thrombosis by cranial computed tomography scan, Doppler ultrasonography, planar and single photon emission computed tomography technetium 99m-labelled red blood cell scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance angiography. Excision of the occipital bone lesion and a short course of acetazolamide and prednisone were curative. We hypothesize that cytokines secreted by the tumor were responsible for the development of intracranial hypertension.

TI CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS - NEW CAUSES FOR AN OLD SYNDROME
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
AB The range of disorders affecting the cerebral veins and sinuses is increasing and now includes blood disorders, abnormalities in the patterns of blood flow, and infiltrative or inflammatory conditions, all of which may promote thrombosis. We describe 10 patients with cerebral venous thrombosis: two had protein S deficiency, one had protein C deficiency, one was in early pregnancy, and there was a single case of each of the following: dural arteriovenous malformation, intracerebral arteriovenous malformation, bilateral glomus tumours, systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The recognition of such diverse aetiology may be importance since clinical features are non-specific, and may consist only of raised intracranial pressure, allowing confusion with 'benign intracranial hypertension'. The existence of effective treatment both for the thrombosis and for many of the underlying disorders makes early diagnosis essential. The prognosis of treated patients may be favourable.

TI Aberrant Sylvian Vein Diverticulum and Tegmen Dehiscence-Induced Venous
   Pulsatile Tinnitus Phenotype Can Be Treated Via Transtemporal Surgery: A
   Case Report with 4D-Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging
SO OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY
AB ObjectiveTo report the first successful surgical treatment of a rare subtype of venous pulsatile tinnitus (PT) caused by aberrant sylvian vein and tegmen dehiscence (SVTD) with a diverticulum and soft tissue enclosing the middle ear ossicles.PatientsA 35-year-old female participant presented with more than 10-year left-side PT due to SVTD diverticulum.Intervention(s)The participant underwent transtemporal surgery with a lateral minimally invasive approach to the epitympanum and aditus ad antrum after finding SVTD and diverticulum.Main Outcome MeasuresContrast-enhanced CT, various magnetic resonance (MR) techniques, including the 4D-flow MR method, and transcanal recording examinations were utilized. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) was employed to quantify the surgical efficacy in treating PT.ResultsPT was successfully resolved following resurfacing of the diverticulum located on the medial wall of the epitympanic space, with the patient achieving a THI score of 0. The 4D-flow MR indicated that the mean and largest velocities at the dehiscence area were 20.8 cm/s and 54.9 cm/s, respectively. The main frequency of PT fluctuated below 750 hz.ConclusionSVTD diverticulum-induced venous PT can be successfully treated via the transtemporal pathway. Additionally, this finding underscores the importance to carefully examine tegmen dehiscence and the exposed vasculature when managing venous PT.

TI Insufficient cerebral venous drainage predicts early edema in acute
   intracerebral hemorrhage
SO NEUROLOGY
AB Objectives
   To explore the relationship between insufficient ipsilateral cerebral venous drainage and the development of perihematomal edema (PHE) and functional outcome in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
   Methods
   We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively collected database for patients with acute spontaneous supratentorial ICH and analyzed patients who underwent baseline CT perfusion (CTP) within 6 hours of onset and noncontrast CT at 24 hours. Absence of filling of 1 or more of the ipsilateral superficial middle cerebral vein, vein of Trolard, vein of Labbe, basal vein of Rosenthal, and internal cerebral vein, evaluated on venous maps generated from baseline CTP, was identified as absent ipsilateral venous filling (AIVF). Relative PHE (rPHE) was calculated as the ratio of PHE volume to hematoma volume on follow-up CT.
   Results
   A total of 138 patients were included. Median absolute PHE volume on follow-up CT was 3.5 (1.0-9.3) mL and rPHE was 24.3% (9.0%-49.4%). One absent ipsilateral vein was observed in 38 (27.5%) patients, and 2 absent veins were observed in 5 (3.6%) patients. Multivariate analysis showed that AIVF was independently associated with large rPHE at 24 hours (odds ratio [OR] 4.032, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.739-9.347, p < 0.001). Large PHE volume was independently associated with poor outcome (OR 1.109, 95% CI 1.009-1.218, p = 0.031).
   Conclusion
   AIVF was observed in about one-third of patients with acute ICH, which might be attributed to hypoperfusion after ICH and was strongly related to the development of PHE. Identification of cerebral venous filling status might be a promising imaging marker for PHE and a potential therapeutic target in ICH.

TI Venous Pathologies and Interventions of the Head
SO SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Intracranial venous pathologies are a historically underrecognized group of disorders that can have a devastating impact on patients. Despite advancements in peripheral venous disorders and arterial neurointerventions, intracranial venous pathologies have received comparatively little attention. Understanding the anatomy, physiology, clinical relevance, and treatment options of intracranial venous pathologies is fundamental to evolving therapies and research priorities. This article provides an overview of major intracranial venous pathologies, the respective pathophysiologies, and treatment options.

TI Cranial Venous Outflow Under Lower Body Positive and Negative Pressure
   Conditions and Head-Up and -Down Tilts
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING
AB Although there exists a large body of knowledge on the regulation of arterial cerebral hemodynamics, little is known about the cerebral venous outflow (CVO).
   In 19 healthy volunteers, the middle cerebral artery and the straight sinus were examined using transcranial Doppler sonography. Arterial and venous mean flow velocities (aFV(mean), vFV(mean), respectively) were registered continuously while applying lower body positive (LBPP) or negative (LBNP) pressure of 30 mmHg and performing head-down (-20 degrees, HDT) and -up (+30 degrees, HUT) tilt manoeuvres. The arterial blood pressure was registered simultaneously with a noninvasive finger blood pressure monitor. Relative changes in parameters compared to the proceeding no-pressure, no-tilt baseline were used for analysis.
   While aFV(mean) did not change significantly, vFV(mean) inc reased during LBPP by 10.5 +/- 2.9% and decreased during LBNP by 15.1 +/- 3.5% (mean +/- standard error of mean [SEM], P < .01). HUT resulted in a decrease in vFV(mean) by 25.5 +/- 3.3% and HDT, in an increase by 7.8 +/- 3.2% (P < .01) without alteration in aFV(mean). This may imply a decrease of cerebral blood volume (CBV) during LBPP and HDT and an increase during LBNP and HUT.
   CVO cannot be neglected when studying cerebral hemodynamics because it might affect the CBV.

TI Effects of dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan on isolated human cerebral
   and peripheral arteries and veins
SO ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB Background: Pharmacological cerebral vasoconstriction has recently been suggested as treatment for patients with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) after severe traumatic brain lesions. Hypothetically, a moderate constriction of precapillary resistance vessels might be advantageous since it decreases intracapillary blood pressure, and a contraction of cerebral veins might effectively reduce intracranial blood volume and ICP. This report examines the in vitro effects of two vasoconstrictors, dihydroergotamine (DHE) and sumatriptan, which may be considered for treatment of increased ICP.
   Methods: The reactivity of isolated small human cerebral, subcutaneous and omental arteries and veins were studied during exposure to different concentrations of DHE and sumatriptan.
   Results: Both sumatriptan and DHE induced concentration-dependent contractions in human cerebral arteries and veins and 50% of maximum contractions were obtained at significantly lower concentrations of DHE than of sumatriptan. The maximum contraction of cerebral arteries was significantly higher with sumatriptan than with DHE. Both drugs caused contractions of subcutaneous arteries at concentrations of 10(-7)-10(-6)M, which is within the therapeutic concentration range of sumatriptan, while no effect was obtained in omental vessels.
   Conclusions: Both DHE and sumatriptan cause contraction of isolated human cortical arteries and veins at very low concentrations. The differences observed between the two drugs may be explained by the fact that DHE is an or-adrenergic as well as a 5-HT agonist while sumatriptan acts specifically on 5-HT receptors. The study supports the hypothesis underlying the use of DHE for the treatment of increased ICP in patients with severe traumatic brain lesions.

TI Cerebral venous thrombosis: when etiology makes the difference
SO NEUROLOGIA
AB Objectives. To make a retrospective study of the clinical, etiological, diagnostic and prognostic features of cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis (CVST) diagnosed at our University Hospital.
   Methods. We performed a systematic research of the clinical records of our University Hospital's electronic database (19772009) using the key words "cerebral vein or sinus thrombosis".
   Results. Ninety-five possible cases were found, and 16 were excluded due to alternative or uncertain diagnosis. Seventy-nine patients (43 females), median age of 46 years (2-82), were studied. Hereditary or acquired thrombophilia was detected in 22 patients (27.8%): prothrombin G20210A mutation (10), factor V Leyden (3), protein C deficiency (2), homozygous MTHFR C677T mutation (1), antiphospholipid syndrome (7) and hematological conditions (3). CVST was associated with infection in 17 cases, intracranial neoplasm in 9, malignancy in 13, treatment with prothrombotic drugs in 20 (including substitutive/antineoplastic hormones and oral contraceptives) and other causes in 8. Thirteen cases were idiopathic. Clinical presentation was intracranial hypertension in 83.5%, focal deficits in 45.6% and seizures in 12.6%. Transverse (57%) and superior sagittal sinus (49.4%) were the most commonly involved. Seizures occurred in 25.3%, venous infarction in 41% and severe intracranial hypertension in 22.8%. Up to 31.6% required surgical drainage, decompressive craniectomy or ventricular drainage. Nine cases associated peripheral venous thromboembolism and 4 CVST recurred. Evolution was favorable (modified Rankin scale 0-2 at 3 months) in 74.7%. Mortality rate was 13.9% (11 patients). Neoplastic and infectious origin was significantly associated with mortality and disability.
   Conclusion. We describe a large retrospective series of CVST where infectious and neoplastic etiologies were linked to an unfavorable outcome.

TI Case Report of a 13-Year-Old Female With Trauma Secondary to a Fall From
   a Golf Cart, Found to Have Intraparenchymal & Subarachnoid Hemorrhages
   With Transverse Sinus Thrombosis
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is the occlusion of cerebral veins of the brain secondary to blood clot formation. These can result in increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and may even have fatal consequences such as a stroke. Despite CVSTs being considered a rare pathology, these are said to have an increased incidence in the pediatric population. These individuals with CVST are often asymptomatic causing physicians to often overlook and delay possibly life-saving interventions. The current literature is lacking on CVST examples in the "older" range of the pediatric population, specifically teenagers. Here we present the case of a 13-year-old female with trauma secondary to a fall from a golf cart, who was found to have intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhages with transverse sinus thrombosis.

TI Shunting in Acute Cerebral Venous Thrombosis: A Systematic Review
SO CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
AB Background and Purpose: The efficacy of cerebrospinal fluid shunting to reduce intracranial hypertension and prevent fatal brain herniation in acute cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is unknown. Method: From the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT) and a systematic literature review, we retrieved acute CVT patients treated only with shunting (external ventricular drain, ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculojugular shunt). Outcome was classified at 6 months and final follow-up by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results: 15 patients were collected (9 from the ISCVT and 6 from the review) who were treated with a shunt (external ventricular drain in 6 patients, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in 8 patients or an unspecified type of shunt in another one). Eight patients (53.3%) regained independence (mRS 0-2), while 2 patients (13.3%) were left with a severe handicap (mRS 4-6) and 4 (26.7%) died despite treatment. Five patients with parenchymal lesions were shunted within 48 h from admission deterioration, 4 with an external ventricular drain: 2 (40%) recovered to independence, 2 (40%) had a severe handicap and 1 (20%) died. In contrast, all 3 patients with intracranial hypertension and no parenchymal lesions receiving a ventriculoperitoneal shunt later than 48 h regained independence. Conclusion and Implications: A quarter of acute CVT patients treated with a shunt died, and only half regained independence. With the limitation of the small number of subjects, this review suggests that shunting does not appear to be effective in preventing death from brain herniation in acute CVT. We cannot exclude that shunting may benefit patients with sustained intracranial hypertension and no parenchymal lesions. (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI Sphenoid Wing Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOVASCULAR THERAPY
AB The sphenoid wing dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are clinically rare. They often present as non-sinus-type arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and may be associated with focal neurological deficits, intracranial venous hypertension, and intracranial hemorrhage. These cases are classified as lesser or greater sphenoid wing lesions. We searched the PubMed databases for studies evaluating the clinical presentation, surgical treatment, and endovascular treatment of these lesions and analyzed 37 cases from 22 papers. A total of 17 cases had lesser sphenoid wing AVFs, and the localization of the shunts could be divided into the sinus of the lesser sphenoid wing (SLSW) or the superficial middle cerebral vein (SMCV). Most SLSW AVFs drained into the cavernous sinus, but two cases drained directly into the deep middle cerebral vein via a bridging vein. All cases with shunts directly into the SMCV had reflux into the SMCV with varices. A total of 20 cases had shunts in the greater sphenoid wing, and the localization of the shunts varied, with shunt localization, and venous return morphology dependent on variations in middle fossa venous return. Most cases had shunts in the sphenobasal vein near the foramen ovale. However, some cases had shunts in the superior ophthalmic vein, sphenopetrosal vein, and laterocavernous sinus. Many were associated with cortical venous reflux. These lesions have been treated by surgical ligation of the drainage vein and transarterial or transvenous embolization. Recently, embolization has become the standard treatment for DAVFs due to advances in endovascular techniques. This paper reviewed and discussed the angioarchitecture, clinical presentation, and treatment of these lesions to clarify the characteristics of sphenoid wing DAVFs.

TI Delay in hospital admission of patients with cerebral vein and dural
   sinus thrombosis
SO CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
AB Factors influencing early hospital admission have been described for several stroke types but not for cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis (CVT). CVT is more difficult to diagnose than arterial stroke; delay in hospital admission may postpone CVT treatment. The purposes of this study were: (1) to describe the delay between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission of patients with CVT, and (2) to identify the variables that influence that delay. We registered the interval (days) between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission in 91 consecutive patients admitted to 20 Portuguese hospitals between June 1995 and June 1998. We also studied the impact of admission delay on treatments (prescription of anticoagulants and the number of days elapsed between the onset of symptoms and start of anticoagulation and admission). Median admission delay was 4 days. Twenty-two (25%) patients were admitted within 24 h. Two thirds of the patients were admitted within 7 days and 75% within 13 days. In multiple logistic regression analysis, admission within 24 h was positively associated with mental status disorder (delirium or abulia; OR = 4.59; 95% CI = 1.41-14.89) and negatively associated with headache ( OR = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.00-0.32). Presentation as isolated intracranial hypertension was associated with admission delay of more than 4 days (OR = 2.63; 95% CI = 0.97-7.14). Papilloedema was associated with an admission delay of more than 13 days (OR = 4.69; 95% CI = 1.61-13.61). There was no association between admission delay and the proportion of anticoagulated patients. The interval between onset of symptoms and start of anticoagulation was shorter in patients admitted earlier (p = 0.0001, for either admission within 24 h, 4 or 13 days). There is a considerable delay until the clinical picture associated with CVT is recognised as justifying hospital admission, especially when patients present with symptoms identical to isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome.

TI NEUROLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF PEDIATRIC ACHONDROPLASIA
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB The neurological and neuroradiological manifestations of pediatric achondroplasia are analyzed on the basis of 10 cases. In addition to the classical symptomatology of an enlarging head, with or without increased intracranial pressure, several patients presented symptoms related to a small foramen magnum. Respiratory problems and quadriparesis were also observed in these patients. Six patients who were treated by foramen magnum decompression showed remarkable improvement. Neuroradiological evaluation revealed a significant number of patients with dilated cortical sulci and basal cisterns, and mild dilatation of the ventricles on computerized tomography (CT) and/or ventriculography. Two patients showed signs of obstruction at the 4th ventricle outlets. Some exhibited anomalous dilatation of cerebral veins and dural sinuses, narrowing of the sinuses at the jugular foramen and enlarged emissary veins. Ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunts were placed in 3 patients. In the other children with a large head and dilated ventricles, head growth curves paralleled the normal slope, and there was no significant clinical evidence of increased intracranial pressure or enlarging ventricles on follow-up CT scan.

TI Cerebral Venous Thrombosis: an Update
SO CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS
AB Purpose of Review The purpose of this update is to summarize the recent advances on the management of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). Recent Findings There is a trend in declining frequency of CVT patients presenting with focal deficits or coma and a decrease in mortality over time. Anemia and obesity were identified as risk factors for CVT. During pregnancy and puerperium, the higher risk of CVT occurs in the first months post-delivery. With appropriate management, 1/3 of comatose CVT patients can have a full recovery. The management of CVT patients includes treatment of associated conditions, anticoagulation with parenteral heparin, prevention of recurrent seizures, and decompressive neurosurgery in patients with large venous infarcts/hemorrhages with impending herniation. After the acute phase, patients should be anticoagulated for 3-12 months. Results of recently completed randomized controlled trials on endovascular treatment and comparing dabigatran with warfarin will improve the treatment of CVT.

AB Cerebral venous anomalies may have a variety of clinical consequences. MR or CT venogram can assist the imaging diagnosis, yet, cerebral angiogram may be required to confirm or establish the correct diagnosis. Venous anomalies pridsposing venous hypertension may be categorized into three major entities such as congenital variations, outflow obstruction and increased blood flow. The degree of clinical presentations of venous hypertentsion depends upon the chronicity or acuteness. Venous hypertension may lead to venous congestion with edema, hemorhage and encephalopathy. Endovascular therapeutic Procedures may be employed to relieve venous congestion either from reducing blood flow or relieving obstruction. Those endovascular treatment options include embolizaton, thrombolysis and angioplasic stentings.

CY MAY 29-30, 2009
CL Stresa, ITALY
AB The alterations of the cerebral venous circulation are a rare but clinically important cause of headache. Although any process involving the cerebral veins or sinuses may cause headache, the most frequent and important are cerebral venous thrombosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The headache of cerebral venous thrombosis does not have specific features and may be isolated; therefore, all patients with headache and risk factors for venous thrombosis should undergo the appropriate neuroradiologic examinations to rule out the diagnosis. In fact, early anticoagulant treatment may dramatically change the clinical outcome. Also idiopathic intracranial hypertension, if untreated, may have serious clinical consequences such as permanent visual loss. The pathogenesis of this disorder has not been clearly established and several possibilities involving the cerebral circulation are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Cerebral vein and dural sinus thromboses (CVT) appear to be rare, but their identification has increased in recent year, due to the increased use of MRI and to a better knowledge of the variable clinical presentation of CVT.
   CVT can be diagnosed by MR and MR-angiography. Catheter angiography is reserved for cases whose diagnosis remains uncertain with MR. The individual risk for CVT is determined by genetic factors, but may be increased by numerous predisposing conditions and precipitating factors. In recent CVT series death rate is below 10 % and about 80 % of patients make a complete recovery. The treatment of CVT includes etiological and symptomatic treatment, antithrombotic therapy (anticoagulants, local thrombolysis) and the treatment of intracranial hypertension. There are few randomized trials upon which to base treatment recommendations.

TI Life-threatening Cerebral Venous Thrombosis: a case report
SO CLINICAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES
AB Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) can compromise dural sinus, cerebral veins or both. It is an uncommon condition and it is more prevalent in young women. Several prothrombotic states are the principal predisposing factors. Clinical spectrum of presentation is wide, so this entity requires a high suspect index for correct and prompt diagnosis. CVT may develop serious complications that can be life-threatening such as hemorrhagic venous infarctions, cerebral edema, and intracranial hypertension.
   This report describes the case of a woman who was in treatment for unspecific vaginal bleeding with oral contraceptives. Suddenly she deteriorated to coma with severe respiratory compromise. Neuroimaging showed thrombosis of multiple venous sinus. Physiological neuroprotection, osmotherapy, mechanical ventilation and anticoagulation therapy were the keystones of treatment. In a few months, the patient has recovered a good functional status, while maintaining a motor deficit on the right hand.

TI Cerebral venous infarction: The pathophysiological concept
SO CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
AB Cerebral venous occlusion represents an often underdiagnosed cause for acute or slowly progressive neurological deterioration. The underlying pathophysiological basis is not well understood, but is different from those of arterial occlusion reflecting therefore different anatomical and physiological features of the cerebral venous system. Extensive collateral circulation within the cerebral venous system allows for a significant degree of compensation in the early stages of venous occlusion. Elevated cerebral venous pressure due to cerebral venous occlusion can result in a spectrum of phenomena including a dilated venous and capillary bed, development of interstitial edema, increased cerebrospinal fluid production, decreased cerebrospinal fluid absorption and rupture of venous structures (hematoma). All of these pathophysiological changes may explain the clinical observation that cerebral venous occlusion, if promptly diagnosed and adequately managed, contains reversible alterations and need not always lead to venous infarction. The present review outlines this different pathophysiological behavior of venous compared to arterial occlusion in the cerebral vasculature; special reference is given to the effect of these changes on the therapeutic impact.

TI Sphenoid dural arteriovenous fistulas
SO NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW
AB Sphenoid wing dural AVFs represent a rare clinical entity. These lesions may be asymptomatic or present with focal neurologic deficits, intracranial venous hypertension, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and diagnostic imaging. They are alternatively classified as lesions of either the greater or lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. We performed a search of the PubMed database of studies evaluating the clinical behavior and surgical and endovascular therapies of these lesions. Dural AVFs draining into the superficial middle cerebral vein and/or laterocavernous sinus, or rather, lesions of the greater wing of the sphenoid, exhibit a greater likelihood of developing an aggressive clinical course, with higher probability of cortical venous reflux and consequent intracranial venous hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, and symptomatic presentation. Dural AVFs of the sphenoparietal sinus, that is, lesions of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, typically exhibit a more benign clinical course, as there is a prominent epidural venous drainage into the cavernous sinus, reducing the risk of cortical venous reflux, and consequently, the probability of intracranial venous hypertension, hemorrhage, and floridly symptomatic presentation. These lesions may be treated via surgical clipping of the fistulous point, transarterial or transvenous embolization, and/or stereotactic radiosurgery. Though surgical intervention was the principal therapy due to facility of craniotomy access to the fistulous point, embolization has become standard of care permitted by innovation in endovascular technology. The natural history, clinical presentation, angioarchitecture, diagnosis, and management of these lesions are reviewed and discussed.

TI Thrombosis of sigmoid sinus, transverse sinus, and internal jugular vein
   in chronic otitis media in 9-year-old girl: a case report
SO ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB Introduction and importance:Chronic otitis media can lead to dreadful intracranial complications, the most common being meningitis. A concomitant finding of thrombosis in more than one sinus with a cerebral vein is extremely rare. Septic sigmoid sinus thrombosis has an infectious origin and the treatment is debatable between antibiotics and surgery.Case presentation:A case of 9-year-old female with prolonged symptoms of right sided ear discharge, fever, right sided neck pain, and vomiting. Examination revealed tachycardia and neck rigidity suggesting meningitis. The child developed shock, generalized seizure, and a persistent high grade fever in the course of hospital stay. Brain imaging revealed sigmoid, transverse, and internal jugular thrombosis. Blood culture grew both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, suggesting the infectious origin of the thrombus. The authors treated meningitis with cephalosporin and vancomycin at first, and then additional antibiotics to treat the septic sigmoid sinus thrombosis.Clinical discussion:Sigmoid sinus thrombosis is a rare condition caused by infections, thrombophilia, head trauma, some types of cancer, and intravenous drug use. Cerebral vein or sinus thrombosis can lead to raised intracranial pressure and can cause fever, otalgia, headache, vomiting, cranial nerve palsies, papilledema altered mental status and may cause seizures, stupor, and coma. Prompt diagnosis by CT scan or MRI and prompt treatment with antibiotics are crucial.Conclusion:Sigmoid sinus thrombosis with involvement of the transverse sinus and internal jugular vein is a rare complication of chronic otitis media, and should be suspected if a recurring fever with features of raised intracranial pressure is present in a child with chronic otitis media.

TI Cerebral Venous Thrombosis A Challenging Neurologic Diagnosis
SO EMERGENCY MEDICINE CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB Headache is a common emergency department chief complaint. Although most are benign, emergency physicians must rapidly identify and manage the uncommon, sometimes subtle, presentation of headache from a life-threatening cause. Cerebral venous thrombosis imparts significant morbidity and mortality, and can be a challenging diagnosis. It most commonly occurs in those younger than 50 years with thrombosis of the cerebral veins/sinuses. Diagnosis is frequently delayed. The disease can present with 1 or more clinical syndromes, including intracranial hypertension with headaches, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and encephalopathy. Diagnosis requires imaging. Treatment includes stabilization, management of complications, and anticoagulation.

TI Chemotherapy associated dural sinus thrombosis presenting as a
   cerebrospinal fluid leak
SO BMJ CASE REPORTS
AB Despite the well documented increased risk of thrombosis in patients with cancer and during chemotherapy, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) remains a rare entity. We present a rare case of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhoea secondary to a left transverse sinus thrombus which occurred 2years previously during chemotherapy for breast cancer. The patient underwent a three-layer repair using Neuro-Patch, septal cartilage and middle turbinate pedicle flap and was started on acetazolamide. There was no recurrence at 1-year follow-up. Raised intracranial pressure secondary to cerebral venous occlusion can erode the base of skull and predispose to CSF leaks. Despite the theoretical risk, there have been no cases reported where CSF leaks have occurred following chemotherapy induced CVT. We describe the first case and discuss pathophysiology and management.

SO HEMOGLOBIN
AB Dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST) is a rare disease associated with hypercoagulable states. Patients with sickle cell disease are known to be prothrombotic. We report a case of DVST presenting with anterior neck and facial pain in a 24-year-old female with sickle cell disease, found to have extensive thrombotic disease involving the internal jugular vein. A literature review of DVST in sickle cell disease consisting of 14 case reports was summarized. Headache was a presenting feature in two-thirds of patients. Nine cases were associated with vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), transfusion, or acute respiratory illness. Most patients were treated with anticoagulation therapy. Over three-quarters either died or suffered from a serious neurological complication, including stroke, seizure, coma, or elevated intracranial pressure. Given its association with life-threatening complications, DVST should be considered when patients with sickle cell disease present with a VOC, especially in the context of headache or neurological deficits.

TI A Rare Presentation of Neurobrucellosis in a 6-Year-Old Pediatric
   Patient with Sagittal Sinus Thrombosis
SO NEUROPEDIATRICS
AB Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonosis worldwide. It is still endemic in many regions of the world. A 6-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department (ED) due to a sudden change in consciousness, urinary incontinence, vomiting, and difficulty in walking. Neurological examination demonstrated abducens nerve paralysis, mild-to-moderate motor deficit in hemiparesis in the left arm. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a hemorrhagic focus at the right frontal lobe and thrombosis in the superior sagittal sinus of the brain. The diagnosis of neurobrucellosis was confirmed by identifying Brucella spp. in the blood culture on the day 6 of pediatric intensive care unit admission; thus, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampicin, and ceftriaxone were promptly initiated. Despite neuroprotective management and acetazolamide, the patient's neurological problems and high intracranial pressure (ICP) persisted. An external ventricular drainage tube and a Codman ICP monitor were placed to be on the consent vigilance of the patient's neurological condition. The patient's ICP continued to increase despite the current treatment regimen; therefore, a decompressive bitemporal craniectomy was performed. The ICP level of the patient returned to its normal range immediately after the craniectomy. The patient did not have any notable neurologic sequelae at the first-year follow-up. Neurobrucellosis is a rare complication of systemic brucellosis and may present as meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, radiculitis, and/or neuritis. Herein, we describe a six-year-old girl with brucellosis complicated with cerebral vein thrombosis. This case illustrates the need for close monitoring of patients with unexplained neurological signs or symptoms for brucellosis in endemic areas.

TI A proposed relationship between increased intraabdominal, intrathoracic,
   and intracranial pressure
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objectives: To determine the effect of acutely increased intraabdominal pressure on pleural pressure, intracranial pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure, and to clarify the relationship between these parameters.
   Design: Nonrandomized, controlled study,
   Setting: Laboratory at a university medical center,
   Subjects: Yorkshire swine, weighing 15 to 20 kg,
   interventions: Anesthetized, ventilated swine had a balloon inserted into the peritoneal cavity and catheters placed for measurement of intracranial pressure, pleural pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and mean arterial pressure, Following baseline measurements, intra-abdominal pressure was increased by incrementally inflating the intraperitoneal balloon. All parameters were remeasured 30 mins after each increase in intra-abdominal pressure, Two groups were studied: a) group 1 (n = 9) animals had intra-abdominal pressure increased to 25 mm Hg above baseline, then released; b) group 2 (n = 3) animals underwent sternotomy and pleuropericardotomy to prevent an increase in pleural pressure with increasing intra-abdominal pressure.
   Measurements and Main Results: Increase of intra-abdominal pressure to 25 mm Hg above baseline caused significant (p<.05) increases in intracranial pressure (7.3 +/- 0.6 [SEM] to 16.4 +/- 1.9 mm Hg), pleural pressure (4.3 +/- 1.3 to 11.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (9.0 +/- 0.6 to 14.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg), and central venous pressure (6.6 +/- 0.7 to 10.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, The cardiac index (3.4 +/- 0.3 to 1.6 +/- 0.1 L/min/m(2)) and cerebral perfusion pressure (75.6 +/- 3.6 to 62.0 +/- 6.8 mm Hg) decreased significantly (p<.05), whereas mean arterial pressure (82.8 +/- 3.2 to 78.4 +/- 6.6 mm Hg) remained essentially constant, Sternotomy and pleuropericardotomy negated all effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure except the decreased cardiac index (1.6 +/- 0.1 to 2.5 +/- 0.2 L/min/m(2)).
   Conclusions: Acutely increased intra-abdominal pressure causes a significant increase in intracranial pressure and a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. Increased intra-abdominal pressure appears to produce this effect by augmenting pleural and other intrathoracic pressures and causing a functional obstruction to cerebral venous outflow via the jugular venous system, it is possible that the same phenomenon may be why persons with chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as the morbidly obese, suffer from a high frequency rate of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

AB The authors describe the treatment of a patient with hydrocephalus due to a cyst of the aqueduct of Sylvius by a computer-assisted stereotactic procedure. The patient presented progressive intracranial hypertension syndrome. The MRI of brain showed increased dimensions of lateral and the third ventricles and a cyst in the distal. half of the aqueduct obliterating CSF flow. After a 3D stereoCT reconstruction and image fusion, the target points of the top and bottom of the cyst were determined. Despite the fact of the cyst to be located in midline, it was possible to draw the trajectory of the probe medially to the internal cerebral veins and laterally to the superior saggital sinus. Through a fronto-parietal burr hole a 1.2mm probe was inserted for a III ventriculography with hydro soluble contrast and the cyst was perforated. The post operative period was uneventful. During the following six months no other abnormalities were found. This report illustrates that the stereotactic method is safe for minimally invasive approach to nonvascular ventricular lesions, specially in situations that rigid endoscopy cannot satisfactory reach the target due to different angles of the aqueduct of Sylvius line and the axis of the foramen of Monro.

TI CLINICAL AND THERAPEUTIC HETEROGENEITY OF CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS: A
   DESCRIPTION OF A SERIES OF 20 CASES
SO REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA
AB Introduction. Current neuro-radiological techniques have led to a more frequent diagnosis of cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT), and revealed its greater clinical heterogeneity. Aim. To analize the characteristics of the cases with the diagnosis of CVT in our unit between 1996 and 2008. Patients and methods. We describe 20 cases of CVT (14 women and 6 men), with ages of 22 to 75 years. Results. Headache was the most frequent symptom, followed by intracranial hypertension, disorders of consciousness and focal deficits. Unusual presentations included transitory ischemia and progressive optical neuropathy. Subacute and chronic courses were more frequent than acute. The etiology was diverse including puerperium, contraception, hyperthyroidism, meningitis, Leiden V factor mutation, multiple myeloma, Crohn, ulcerative colitis, meningioma and epidural anesthesia. No cause was found in 8 cases. Magnetic resonance imaging was always diagnostic. Patients were anticoagulated during the acute phase. In subacute or chronic presentations, a more conservative treatment was considered on individual basis. Only 6 patients had mild sequelae. Conclusions. We report a great variety of etiologies and patterns of presentation of CVT. CVT should be suspected in patients with subacute headache, even in outpatients. Nonacute presentation with isolated headache or intracranial hypertension could have better prognosis, requiring a less aggressive therapy [REV NEUROL 2009; 49: 573-6]

TI Not Just Another Headache: Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis in a Patient
   With Isolated Antithrombin III Deficiency
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare condition. Symptoms and signs arise from a combination of thrombosis of cerebral veins and increased intracranial pressure. The most common presenting symptom is a non-descriptive headache, but presentation varies with underlying etiology. CVST requires a high index of suspicion to diagnose, particularly in those without apparent risk factors. Evaluation and diagnosis should include a combination of a thorough history, ophthalmoscopic examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. Management is multidimensional and aims to reverse the underlying causes, and prompt treatment with anticoagulation by heparin to decrease thrombotic burden, risk of permanent neurological deficits, and death. In the present study, we report the case of a 61-year-old man referred to the emergency department by an ophthalmologist for bilateral papilledema and eventually diagnosed with CVST secondary to isolated antithrombin III deficiency. Although CVST is uncommon, this case is worthwhile to report as the presentation is unique, and it requires a high index of clinical awareness for timely diagnosis and early therapeutic intervention.

TI Cerebral venous pressure, intra-abdominal pressure, and dural venous
   sinus stenting in idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Increased pressure in the dural venous sinuses has been proposed as the cause of increased intracranial pressure in the condition known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This hypothesis has received further support from manometry of the dural venous sinuses, showing a substantial proximal-to-distal pressure gradient, and from reports of improvement of IIH following stenting of the dural sinuses. Increased intracranial venous pressure has also been proposed as the cause of IIH in morbid obesity through increased abdominal pressure that is transmitted through the thorax to the cerebral draining veins. Although these hypotheses are intriguing, neither has enough scientific support to be endorsed yet. Moreover, dural venous sinus stenting should not be adopted as a therapeutic procedure in IIH until larger clinical trials attest to its safety and efficacy.

TI CEREBRAL VENOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS IN A PATIENT WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARY
   SYNDROME
SO ACTA ENDOCRINOLOGICA-BUCHAREST
AB Background. There are many systemic illnesses that constitute risk factors for cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT). The association between cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been rarely reported in the literature. This report describes a case of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis following intake of contraceptive pill (cyproterone acetate 2mg + etinil-estradiol 35 micrograms), for dysfunctional uterine bleeding secondary polycystic ovary syndrome in young women.
   Case report. We reported a 22-year-old women presented with severe headache associated with vomiting sudden onset; she had been taking contraceptive pills for the previous ten days. CVT was diagnosed with CT scan, MRT and MR venography. Laboratory investigations showed no evidence of inherited thrombophilia. The patient was treated with classic heparine, followed by acenocumarol with good clinical outcome.
   Conclusions. This case illustrates that patients with polycystic ovary syndrome may develop thrombosis, if the patient is treated with combined contraceptives, even for short period of time. The role of PCOS as independent prothrombotic factor and the risk associated with oral contraceptive as first line treatement in PCOS need to be further investigated.

TI Intrathoracic pressure regulation for intracranial pressure management
   in normovolemic and hypovolemic pigs
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
CT 8th Wolf Creek Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
CY JUN 10-13, 2005
CL Rancho Mirage, CA
AB Objective: To evaluate the potential to use subatmospheric intrathoracic pressure to regulate intracranial pressure (ICP) in normovolemic and hypovolemic animals, we tested the hypothesis that mechanical devices designed to reduce intrathoracic pressure will decrease ICP in a dose-related manner. An inspiratory impedance threshold device was used in spontaneously breathing animals and an intrathoracic pressure regulator was attached to a positive pressure ventilator and used in apneic animals: both devices lower intrathoracic pressure.
   Design: Prospective, randomized animal study.
   Setting. Animal laboratory facilities.
   Subjects: A total of 36 female farm pigs in four different protocols (n = 12, 6, 12, and 6, respectively).
   Interventions, Measurements, and Main Results. In all protocols, endotracheal, right atrial, central aortic, and ICP were measured continuously. In protocol 1, spontaneously breathing animals were randomized to breath for 15 mins through an impedance threshold device with a cracking pressure of -10 or -15 mm Hg. In protocol 2, after untreated ventricular fibrillation for 4 mins and successful defibrillation to a normal rhythm, spontaneously breathing pigs were used to evaluate the effect of two different impedance threshold device cracking pressures (-10 and -15 mm Hg) on increased ICP. In protocol 3, the acute effects of an intrathoracic pressure regulator on ICP were evaluated in combination with a positive pressure mechanical ventilator in apneic hypovolemic hypotensive pigs after 35% or 50% blood loss. In protocol 4, after 40% blood loss, an intrathoracic pressure regulator was applied for 120 mins and ICP was recorded to determine whether the intrathoracic pressure regulator effects were sustained over time. Inspiratory impedance successfully decreased ICP in spontaneously breathing pigs in a dose-dependent manner and decreased elevated ICP immediately after cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. The same effect was seen in apneic animals with the use of the intrathoracic pressure regulator. The effect was more pronounced in hypovolemia, and it was sustained for >= 2 hrs.
   Conclusions. Reduction of intrathoracic pressure to subatmospheric levels resulted in an instantaneous and sustained reduction in ICP in spontaneously breathing and apneic animals. The effect was most pronounced in the hypovolemic animals.

TI Cerebral venous thrombosis: Diagnosis and management in the emergency
   department setting
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB Introduction: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon neurologic emergency associated with signifi-cant morbidity and mortality that can be difficult to differentiate from other conditions. It is important for the emergency clinician to be familiar with this disease as it requires a high index of suspicion, and early diagnosis and management can lead to improved outcomes. Objective: This narrative review provides an evidence-based update concerning the presentation, evaluation, and management of CVT for the emergency clinician. Discussion: CVT is due to thrombosis of the cerebral veins resulting in obstruction of venous outflow and in-creased intracranial pressure. Early recognition is important but difficult as the clinical presentation can mimic more common disease patterns. The most common patient population affected includes women under the age of 50. Risk factors for CVT include pregnancy, medications (oral contraceptives), inherited thrombophilia, prior venous thromboembolic event, malignancy, recent infection, and neurosurgery. CVT can present in a variety of ways, but the most common symptom is headache, followed by focal neurologic deficit, seizure, and altered mental status. Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) venography or magnetic resonance (MR) ve-nography should be obtained in patients with concern for CVT, as non-contrast CT will be normal or have non-specific findings in most patients. Treatment includes anticoagulation, treating seizures and elevated ICP aggres-sively, and neurosurgical or interventional radiology consultation in select cases. Conclusions: CVT can be a challenging diagnosis. Knowledge of the risk factors, patient presentation, evaluation, and management can assist emergency clinicians. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI BEHCETS-DISEASE - NEUROLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS IN 24 CASES
SO REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE
AB Dominant symptoms in 24 patients with neurological manifestations of Behcet''s disease were meningo-encephalitis (13 cases), febrile meningeal syndrome  (3 cases), intracranial hypertension (6 cases), polyneuritis of the lower limbs (1 case) and isolated retrobulbarocular neuritis (1 case). Several classical notions concerning the Neuro-Behcet meningo-encephalitis were confirmed: the frequency of central motor lesions (33%) CSF alterations (anomalies in 100% cases in the initial stage), and the often unfavorable course (40%). An unusual finding in this series was the frequency of cerebral vein thrombosis (4 certain and 2 probable). These could be differentiated from meningo-encephalitis by their symptomatology, predominantly that of intracranial hypertension, and by their course: often the 1st disorder to appear in the course of Behcet''s disease, they followed a favorable neurological course but were constantly complicated by other vascular manifestations, usually phlebitis. A long-term anticoagulant treatment should probably be associated with corticoid therapy in these forms.

TI Usefulness of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis
   and therapeutic strategy of deep cerebral venous thrombosis: A case
   report
SO NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY
AB We present the usefulness of Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DWI) in diagnosis and therapeutic strategy of deep cerebral venous thrombosis (VT). We report a 37-year-old man who suffered general convulsion and deep coma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high intensity in the right caudate nuclei and bilateral thalamus on T2-weighted images. DWI showed slightly high intensity in the same area and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is normal or slightly high (0.748similar to1.100x10(-3)mm(2)/s).Cerebral angiography showed occlusion of straight sinus from basal veins and internal cerebral veins bilaterally. We treated by anticoagulation, ventricle drainage, barubiturate and normothermia therapy with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. We considered endovascular thrombolysis to be dangerous in this case because of hemorhhage and didn't it. ICP was more than 40mmHg and consciousness was comatose in acute stage, however, ICP gradually got to be normal, consciousness became almost clear and he recovered. Follow-up Cerebral angiography showed recanalization of deep venous thrombosis. Followup MRI showed disappearance of high intensity in the right caudate nuclei and bilateral thalamus on T2-weighted images and DWI. In this case, we could predict reversible vasogenic edema by DWI and ADC in VT.

TI Anticoagulant treatment in hemorrhagic brains infarts due to large sinus
   venous thrombosis
SO NEUROLOGIA
AB Cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis is an infrequent condition which presents with a wide spectrum of signs and a variable mode of onset. Sinus thrombosis may cause isolated intracranial hypertension but also may cause cerebral venous infarcts, which are frequently hemorrhagic. Treatment with antithrombotic agents is controversial because there is only one randomised controlled trial with unfractionated heparin. We report a 46-years-old man complaining of progressive headache, paraparesis and dysphasia. After admission, his neurological status worsened and he developed tetraparesis, depressed level of consciousness and seizures. A cranial computarized tomography (CT) scan showed multiple hyperdensities suggestive of hemorrhagic infarcts. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study confirmed extensive cerebral venous thrombosis. Unfractionated heparin was administered for two weeks followed by acenocumarol. Within a few days his neurological status improved, and five weeks after admission the patient only hadd slight neurological deficit. After I I years of follow-up, he has had a complete recovery. The G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was detected as a likely risk factor for venous thrombosis. Therapeutical and diagnosis aspects are discussed. We review the previous literature on the topic.

TI Cerebral venous thrombosis - A guide to diagnosis and drug treatment
SO CNS DRUGS
AB Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a relatively rare pathological condition. The clinical presentations can be nonspecific and quire variable, frequently resulting in delayed or missed diagnosis. The symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbance, altered consciousness and seizures. These symptoms are believed to be caused by increased intracranial pressure secondary to impeded venous drainage.
   The diagnosis can be made with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonant imaging (MRI) and cerebral angiography. CT is usually the initial diagnostic test that may show dense clot in the cerebral veins along with hemorrhagic venous infarctions. Empty delta sign can be seen on contrast-enhanced CT. MRI has become the preferred modality for detecting CVT; magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and venography (MRV) are the best methods for detecting the condition. Angiography, once the standard, is now only indicated when MRI has resulted in an uncertain diagnosis or when endovascular intervention is desired.
   Therapy should be directed at treating the underlying causative process and symptoms secondary to elevated intracranial pressure. Although there is no consensus regarding antithrombotic treatment, the current trend is to use intravenous heparin initially, followed by warfarin. A newer approach has been developed using interventional endovascular modalities. Local infusion of thrombolytics can be achieved by transvenous catheterisation and catheter navigation. This may offer potential advantages over the established systemic antithrombotic therapy.

TI INTEREST AND NECESSITY OF COMBINED NEURORADIOLOGICAL AND NEUROSURGICAL
   TREATMENT IN SOME CASES OF DURAL ARTERIOVENOUS-FISTULAS
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB The authors report 3 observations of dural arterio-venous fistula cured by combined neuroradiological and neurosurgical intervention. In the first case, the shunt affected the left lateral sinus. Repeated embolizations failed whilst intracranial hypertension developed, as a consequence of flux in the opposite lateral sinus and in the sagittal sinus. Surgical intervention, consisting in isolation of the transverse sinus, led to complete cure, after a one month delay. In the second case, the shunt was adjacent to the sagittal sinus, right parietal, and had led to an intracerebral haematoma, by rupture of an arterialized cortical vein. Embolizations alone could not cure the fistula which therefore had to be excised. In the third case, the shunt was located in the falx, at the parieto-occipital junction, and was responsible for arterialization of cerebral veins in the right parieto-occipital region. For this reason, after failure of endovascular treatment, the fistula was coagulated, with subsequent complete cure.
   These three cases illustrate the different types of drainage of such arterio-venous fistula, and their corresponding neurological symptoms and signs, complications and risks, that required a radical - not only clinical, but also anatomical - cure. This aim was achieved when embolizations were accompanied by direct surgical attack.

TI The role of arterial and venous pressure for volume regulation of an
   organ enclosed in a rigid compartment with application to the injured
   brain
SO ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB Background: Treatment of increased intracranial pressure often includes an active change in arterial and venous pressure, sometimes with draining of cerebrospinal fluid. We evaluated tissue and perfusion pressure during corresponding interventions in an organ enclosed in a rigid compartment with capillaries permeable for electrolytes and impaired autoregulation, conditions comparable to those present in the injured brain.
   Method: An isolated cat skeletal muscle enclosed in a closed fluid-filled plethysmograph served as a model for the injured brain surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid and the cranium. Tissue pressure and blood flow were measured during variation in arterial and venous pressures and in intraplethysmographic fluid volume. Autoregulation was depressed by papaverine.
   Results: 1) Tissue pressure was not influenced by the venous pressure when this was below the tissue pressure, hereby generating venous collapse and a venous outflow resistance. When venous pressure was higher than the tissue pressure (no venous outflow resistance), these two parameters changed in parallel. 2) A change in arterial pressure induced a similar large change in tissue pressure at steady state, whereas blood flow remained unchanged. 3) Variation in tissue pressure induced by a change in the intraplethysmographic fluid volume was transient.
   Conclusions: if applicable to the injured brain, the results indicate that 1) a venous pressure change has a small influence on the intracranial pressure when a venous outflow resistance is present, 2) brain oedema can be reduced by lowering of the arterial inflow pressure, and blood flow will be maintained, 3) the decrease in intracranial pressure obtained by draining cerebrospinal fluid will be transient.

During drug-induced [metaraminol], severe, acute arterial hypertension and parallel hypercapnia, venous pressure could exceed intracranial pressure in the supra- and infratentorial compartment. Cerebral venous pressure during acute arterial hypertension may contribute to protein extravasation at the postcapillary-venular level.

TI Angiographic signs of venous hypertension and clinical findings of
   increased intracranial pressure in dural arteriovenous fistulas:
   evolution after endovascular treatment
SO JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) can cause cerebral venous hypertension (VHT). The most common mechanism is dire to the fact that some dAVFs can drain retrogradelly in cortical (better defined as leptomeningeal) veins (directly or after drainage in a dural sinus) causing venous engorgement and consequently an impairment of the cerebral venous drainage. However, more rarely, dAVFs without a cortical venous drainage can also be responsible for VHT probably due to dAVF shunts causing insufficient antegrade cerebral venous drainage. In addition, dAVFs are often associated with stenosis and/or thrombosis of dural sinus(es) which can worsen the VHT. Raised pressure within the superior sagittal sinus causes impeded cerebrospinal reabsorption in the arachnoid villi allowing increased intracranial pressure. The venous engorgement in the cortical veins can cause a venous congestive encephalopathy analogous to the venous congestive myelopathy of the spinal dural AVFs. Clinically VHT can cause, not only symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure but also seizures, neurological deficits, impairment of the cognitive functions and dementia. An important aspect is the risk of hemorrhage in dAVFs with a leptomeningeal venous drainage leading to VHT. Although the term VHT sensu strictu should be used if venous pressure measurements are performed, angiographic criteria for VHT such as delayed circulation rb,lc, venous engorgement and abnormal visualization of the cerebral veins are well established The purpose of our study was to evaluate the angiographic signs of VHT in patients with dAVF and to study the course of the VHT and of the clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure before and after dAVF endovascular treatment.
   A retrospective chart analysis of 22 patients (13 males, 9 females) ranging in age from 20 to 87 years (mean : 53 ys.) with a dAVF associated with angiographic signs of VHT was performed. Ten dAVFs were located on the transverse/sigmoid, sinus(es), 6 on the superior sagittal sinus, 3 on the petro-tentorial incisura, 1 on the inferior petrosal sinus, 1 on the anterior ethmoidal region and 1 on the Galen vein region. All dAVFs had a retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage. Stenosis or thrombosis of the dural AVF sinus was observed in 17 cases and stenosis or thrombosis of another sinus(es) and/or of the jugular vein in 8 cases. In 11 patients, the angiographic signs of VHT were global affecting the entire cerebral venous drainage and, in the other 11 patients, the VHT was focal. The VHT caused clinical symptoms of increased intracranial pressure in 18 patients. Other clinical findings included : bruit (11 cases), seizures (3 cases), vertigo 13 cases), visual deficits (2 cares and impairment of cognitive functions (4 cases). Three patients presented hemorrhage (one parenchymal hematoma, one hemorrhagic infarction and one subarachnoid hemorrhage). The 4 patients without clinical symptoms of increased intracranial pressure presented only bruit in 2 cases, bruit and vertigo in 1 case, bruit and hemorrhagic infarction in another one. The dAVFs were treated by endovascular therapy (arterial approach : 3 cases, venous approach : 6 cases and both arterial and venous approach : 13 cases). Endovascular sessions ranged from 1 to 7 (mean : 2.8) for Each patient. After die endovascular treatment, in 12 patients with complete occlusion of the dAVF, the disappearance of angiographic signs of VHT and clinical cure were observed. Oz 8 patients with partial occlusion of the dAVF, the disappearance of angiographic signs of VHT anti clinical dire were observed in 4 cases (almost complete dAVF occlusion in 2 cases); in the other 3 cases, only reduction the angiographic signs of VHT and clinical improvement were obtained. In all 16 patients who were clinically cured angiographic signs of VHT disappeared despite the persistence of dAVF shunts as observed in 4 cases. In 2 patients, who presented a very serious clinical status and died a few days after embolization, a slight reduction of the dAVF shunts caused no modifications of the angiographic signs of VHT; the patients were clinically unchanged. Complete recovery or dramatic improvement of cognitive functions was observed in the 4 patients with impaired mental status. In conclusion, VHT is an important consequence of dural AVFs. It must be kept in mind that, despite serious clinical and angiographic findings, these patients may dramatically improve if treated. Evolution of the angiographic signs of VHT seems to be a predictive factor of the endovascular treatment efficacity. In most of the cases endovascular treatment, el era if partial, can obtain the disappearance of angiographic signs of VHT with cure of the clinical symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.

TI Pulmonary Embolus from Acute Superior Sagittal Sinus Thrombosis
   Secondary to Skull Fracture: Case Report
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Pulmonary embolus (PE) occurring concurrent with-and as a result of-traumatic superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (SSST) has never before been reported. We report the first case of a patient who presented with acute traumatic SSST and concomitant PE.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old man presented with altered mental status after a motorcycle collision, and subsequently developed respiratory distress. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the head revealed multiple calvarial and skull base fractures, contusions, and hemorrhages. Air was noted within the superior sagittal sinus, indicating a fracture involving the sinus and suggesting thrombus formation. A chest CT scan obtained at the time of presentation revealed a PE in the right pulmonary artery. The patient had no personal or family history of hypercoagulability, and all coagulation study results were within normal limits. Work-up revealed no evidence of long bone fractures or deep venous thrombosis. Initial intervention involved placement of an external ventricular drain, brain tissue oxygen saturation probe, internal jugular venous oxygen saturation monitor, arterial line, and central venous line with extensive treatment of all abnormal values according to established standards. Ultimately, pentobarbital coma was initiated for persistently elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) refractory to conservative measures. Aggressive pulmonary resuscitation was required to maintain adequate oxygenation. Anticoagulation was begun 3 weeks after admission.
   CONCLUSION: Our patient had good neurological recovery. This report highlights the possibility of acute PE in the setting of traumatic SSST.

TI Neurological complications of Behcet's syndrome
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB In this review of the neurological complications of Behcet's syndrome, the clinical features and epidemiology of the systemic disease are summarised before a discussion of the neurological syndromes which may develop is made. Neurological involvement occurs in 9% of cases, and is equally prevalent in each geographical area. Vascular complications occur in 14%, in whom thrombosis of the venous sinuses or cerebral veins occurs, and intracranial hypertension, venous infarction and parenchymal haemorrhage may develop. There is a correlation with the prevalence of peripheral venous thrombosis. Concurrent inflammatory disease of the brain is most uncommon. Inflammation may affect any part of the central nervous system, but most commonly involves a subacute meningoencephalitis of the brainstem and diencephalon. Inflammatory lesions elsewhere in the brain and in the spinal cord may occur, and tumefactive lesions may arise from the diencephalon. Cognitive dysfunction and affective symptoms, including psychosis, may occur, and there are high levels of anxiety and fatigue which are related to the severity of the systemic disease, all of which are more severe in those with neurological involvement. Imaging shows enhancing lesions which often disappear after treatment, but atrophy is common. The CSF is active when there is a meningoencephalitis, and oligoclonal bands do not occur. Treatment is with steroids and immunosuppression. Those with treatment resistant disease respond to biological agents, including TNF alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 antagonists.

TI Evaluation of the transverse venous sinus with transcranial color-coded
   duplex
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING
AB Background and PurposeUltrasound-derived diagnosis of transverse venous sinus stenosis (TVSS) may have a promise given recent exploration of its role in pathophysiology of intracranial hypertension and availability of interventions like venous stenting. We investigated transverse venous sinus (TVS) insonation using transcranial color-coded duplex (TCCD) to establish normative values, inform on inherent physiological variability, and other measures to allow future studies on testing the construct validity of TCCD venous in diagnosing TVSS. MethodsAn institutional review board-approved prospective observational study evaluated 20 healthy volunteers to define TCCD-based measures for the TVS. Comparatively, the basal vein of Rosenthal, deep middle cerebral veins, and internal jugular veins were insonated. We report on physiological variability including the intrasubject, intersubject, and side-to-side variability; gradient of TVS velocities on each side from medial to lateral insonation; and the relationship between TVS and other insonated venous structures. ResultsFifteen out of 20 subjects had the TVS insonated bilaterally, and five had unilaterally (four right, one left). TVS velocities had comparable intrasubject variability to other intracranial veins insonated and lower velocity-based variability than the pulsatility index. There was significant side-side variability in TVS-derived measures without discernible patterns. Insonating TVS from medial to lateral revealed a gradient with a bimodal peak in ultrasound-derived velocities. We did not find discernible relationships between TVS and other veins for TCCD-derived measures.

AB Background: Previous studies have documented an increase in intracranial pressure with abdominal insufflation, but the mechanism has not been explained.
   Methods: Nine 30-35-kg domestic pigs underwent carbon dioxide insufflation at 1.5 l/min. Intracranial pressure (ICP), lumbar spinal pressure (LF), central venous pressure (CVP), inferior vena cava pressure (IVCP), heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and end-tidal CO2 were continuously measured, mechanical ventilation was used to maintain a constant pCO(2). Measurements were recorded at 0, 5, 10, and 15 mmHg of abdominal pressure with animals in supine, Trendelenburg (T), and reverse Trendelenburg (RT) positions, Prior to recording measurements, the animals were allowed to stabilize for 40 min after each increase in abdominal pressure and for 20 min after each position change.
   Results: The animals showed a significant increase in ICP (mmHg) with each 5-mmHg increase in abdominal pressure (0 mmHg: 14 +/- 1.7; 5 mmHg: 19.8 +/- 2.3, p < 0.001; 10 mmHg: 24.8 +/- 2.5, p < 0.001; 15 mmHg: 29.8 +/- 4.7, p < 0.01). The ICP at 15 mmHg abdominal pressure increased further in the T position (39 +/- 4, p < 0.01). Insufflating in the RT position did not significantly reduce the increase in ICP. The IVCP (mmHg) increased with increased abdominal pressure 10 mmHg: 11.5 +/- 6.2, 15 mmHg: 22.1 +/- 3.5, p < 0.01). This increase correlated with the increase in ICP and LP (r of mean pressures greater than or equal to 0.95). There was no significant change in CVP.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that care may be needed with laparoscopy in patients at risk for increased ICP due to head injury or a space occupying lesion. The mechanism of increased ICP associated with insufflation is most likely impaired venous drainage of the lumbar venous plexus at increased intraabdominal pressure. Further studies of cerebral spinal fluid movement during insufflation are currently underway to confirm this hypothesis.

TI Systemic Thrombolysis for Cerebral Venous and Dural Sinus Thrombosis: A
   Systematic Review
SO CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
AB Background: The use of thrombolytics is frequently considered in patients with cerebral venous and dural sinus thrombosis (CVT) who deteriorate despite anticoagulant therapy. Purpose: To collect all the published information about the use of systemic thrombolysis in CVT in order to assess its efficacy and safety. Methods: We performed a PubMed search, checked all reference lists of studies found and used data from the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT). Outcome was classified at the last available follow-up by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The cases were stratified according to variables that might influence outcome. Results: A total of 16 reports (26 patients, 2 from the ISCVT and 24 from the systematic review of the literature) were included. No randomized clinical trial was found. Seven patients presented with isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome (26.9%), 17 with encephalopathy (65.4%) and 2 were comatose (7.7%). The superior sagittal sinus was the one most often affected (n = 21; 80.8%), and there was thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system in 5 patients (19.2%). Urokinase was the thrombolytic agent most frequently administered (n = 19; 73.1%), whereas streptokinase and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator were used in 2 cases each (7.7%). Intracranial hemorrhages occurred in 3 cases (11.5%). Extracranial hemorrhages occurred in 5 cases (19.2%), and overall there were 3 cases of serious bleeding (11.5%), including 2 deaths (7.7%). Partial or complete recanalization was verified in most patients (n = 16; 61.5%). The survival rate was 92.3% (24/26 patients). At the last available follow-up, 22/25 patients regained independency (mRS scores 0-2; 88%), 2/25 died (mRS score 6; 8%) and 1/25 was severely dependent (mRS scores 3-5; 4%). Conclusions: In all, 88% of the CVT patients treated with systemic thrombolysis regained their independency, but 2 deaths associated with intracranial hemorrhage occurred. The mortality rate and disability at the last available follow-up were similar to those found in 2 previous systematic reviews concerning the use of thrombolytics in CVT. Due to the small sample size and lack of controls, the efficacy of systemic thrombolysis in acute CVT cannot be assessed from the published information. Concerning safety, a nonnegligible proportion of bleedings was reported. (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI Intracranial Hypertension and Intra-abdominal Pressure. Is it Worth
   Measuring?
SO BRAZILIAN NEUROSURGERY-ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE NEUROCIRURGIA
AB Patients with refractory intracranial hypertension who have already undergone all the measures recommended by the current guidelines can benefit from having their intraabdominal pressure monitored since its increase generates hemodynamic repercussions and secondary elevation of intracranial pressure. In this context, a bibliographic research was performed on PubMed with the terms intra-abdominal pressure, abdominal compartment syndrome, intracranial pressure, intracranial hypertension. Altogether, 146 articles were observed, 87 of which were from the year 2000, and only 15 articles were considered relevant to the topic. These studies indicate that patients with refractory intracranial hypertension can benefit fromthe measurement of intraabdominal pressure, since there is evidence that an increase in this pressure leads to organic dysfunctions with an indirect impact on cerebral venous return and, consequently, an increase in intracranial pressure. In thosewho underwent decompression laparotomy, direct effectswere observed in reducing intracranial hypertension and survival.

   intracranial hypertension in the setting of venous sinus stenosis: A
   call for new nomenclature and diagnostic precision
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is traditionally characterized by elevated intracranial pressure without an identifiable cause, primarily affecting obese women. However, recent evidence suggests that venous sinus stenosis may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of IIH, challenging its designation as "idiopathic." This editorial discusses the limitations of the current nomenclatures and diagnostic criteria, highlighting the importance of routine venography in detecting venous sinus abnormalities, irrespective of a patient's demographic profile. We propose a new nomenclature of this subset of patients to venous sinus stenosis intracranial hypertension in order to promote more accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment, including potential endovascular interventions.

TI Elevated systemic venous pressures as a possible pathology in
   prepubertal pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB BackgroundPediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare and challenging condition. As implied by the nomenclature, the etiologies remain unknown, and multiple etiologies are being investigated. In this study, we explored the potential role of increased systemic or cerebral venous pressure in the pathogenesis.MethodAn observational cohort study following the STROBE guidelines, including prepubertal children with clinical symptoms and imaging findings consistent with IIH referred to the neurosurgical department, was conducted. The patients underwent a comprehensive diagnostic protocol, including MRI, continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, and endovascular venography with venous pressure measurements.ResultsThe study included 11 consecutive patients (six boys and five girls) with an average age of 2.3 years, and an average BMI of 18.4. Among these, one patient was found to have venous stenosis with a gradient; the other 10 patients presented with normal intracranial anatomy. All patients exhibited elevated venous pressures, with an average superior sagittal sinus pressure of 18.9 mmHg, average internal jugular vein pressure of 17.0 mmHg, and average central venous pressure of 15.9 mmHg. Daytime ICP averaged 12.9 mmHg, whereas nighttime ICP averaged 17.2 mmHg with either A- or B-waves in 10 of the 11 patients. Despite pathological ICP, only three patients had papilledema.ConclusionsAll patients had an increased systemic venous pressure, indicating a possible pathological factor for prepubertal IIH. Additionally, our findings show that young children often only partly meet the Friedman criteria due to a lack of papilledema, emphasizing the need for pediatric-specific diagnostic criteria. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and to explore the underlying reasons for this increase in venous pressure and potential new treatment avenues.

TI The significance of intra-abdominal pressure in neurosurgery and
   neurological diseases: a narrative review and a conceptual proposal
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is a physiological parameter that has gained considerable attention during the last few decades. The incidence of complications arising from increased IAP, known as intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome in critically ill patients, is high and its impact is significant. The effects of IAP in neurological conditions and during surgical procedures are largely unexplored. IAP also appears to be relevant during neurosurgical procedures (spine and brain) in the prone position, and in selected cases, IAH may affect cerebrospinal fluid drainage after a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation. Furthermore, raised IAP is one of the contributors to intracranial hypertension in patients with morbid obesity. In traumatic brain injury, case reports described how abdominal decompression lowers intracerebral pressure. The anatomical substrate for transmission of the IAP to the brain and venous system of the spine is the extradural neural axis compartment; the first reports of this phenomenon can be found in anatomical studies of the sixteenth century. In this review, we summarize the available knowledge on how IAP impacts the cerebrospinal venous system and the jugular venous system via two pathways, and we discuss the implications for neurosurgical procedures as well as the relevance of IAH in neurological disorders.

TI "Idiopathic" intracranial hypertension: An update from
   neurointerventional research for clinicians
SO CEPHALALGIA
AB BackgroundThe recognition of venous sinus stenosis as a contributing factor in the majority of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension coupled with increasing cerebral venography and venous sinus stenting experience have dramatically improved our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms driving this disease. There is now a dense, growing body of research in the neurointerventional literature detailing anatomical and physiological mechanisms of disease which has not been widely disseminated among clinicians. MethodsA literature search was conducted, covering the most recent neurointerventional literature on idiopathic intracranial hypertension, the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and management strategies (including venous sinus stenting), and subsequently summarized to provide a comprehensive review of the most recently published studies on idiopathic intracranial hypertension pathophysiology and management. ConclusionRecent studies in the neurointerventional literature have greatly improved our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms causing idiopathic intracranial hypertension and its associated conditions. The ability to make individualized, patient-specific treatment approaches has been made possible by advances in our understanding of how venous sinus stenosis and cerebral venous hypertension fundamentally contribute to idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

TI Cerebral Venous Thrombosis
SO NEUROSURGICAL EMERGENCIES, 3RD EDITION
AB Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has a more diverse clinical presentation than other stroke types. The confirmation of the diagnosis of CVT relies on the demonstration of thrombi in the cerebral veins and/or sinuses by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/MR venography or computed tomography (CT) venography. The clinical presentation of CVT can be one of a venous infarction, an intracerebral hemorrhage, or rarely a subarachnoid hemorrhage or subdural hematoma. Head trauma and meningioma are well-known associated conditions for CVT. Diagnostics and treatment procedures (e.g., lumbar puncture, spinal anesthesia) that intentionally or accidentally pierce the dura are also risk factors for CVT, as well as insertion of central venous catheters. Some neurosurgical procedures, such as removal of meningiomas and other brain tumors, can be complicated by CVT. The prognosis of CVT is in general favorable, with about 4% mortality in the acute phase and a total of 15% of the patients remaining dependent or dying. The fundamental treatment in the acute phase is anticoagulation. In patients in severe condition on admission or who deteriorate despite anticoagulation, local thrombolysis or thrombectomy is an option. Decompressive hemicraniectomy is lifesaving in patients with large intracranial venous infarcts or hemorrhages and impending herniation. After the acute phase, patients should remain anticoagulated for a variable period of time, depending on their inherent thrombotic risk. A few patients develop a chronic syndrome of intracranial hypertension. In these patients, acetazolamide, repeated lumbar punctures, and eventually a lumboperitoneal drain or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be used to ameliorate the symptoms. Exceptionally, a dural fistula may be a late complication of a permanent dural sinus occlusion.

TI Results of surgery in symptomatic non-hydrocephalic pineal cysts: role
   of magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers indicative of central venous
   hypertension
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB We have previously proposed that pineal cysts (PCs) may result in crowding of the pineal recess, causing symptoms due to compression of the internal cerebral veins and central venous hypertension. In the present study, we compared clinical outcome of different treatment modalities in symptomatic individuals with non-hydrocephalic PCs.
   The study included all patients managed surgically for non-hydrocephalic PCs in our Department of Neurosurgery over a 10-year period. We applied a questionnaire to determine occurrence of symptoms before and after surgery, which allowed the use of a grading scale for symptom severity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers indicative of central venous hypertension were assessed before and after surgery.
   Relief of symptoms after surgery was most efficiently obtained by complete microsurgical cyst removal [n = 15; no (0/15), some (1/15) or marked (14/15) improvement], and to a lesser extent by microsurgical cyst fenestration [n = 6; no (2/6), some (4/6) or marked (0/6) improvement]. Shunt surgery was not successful [n = 6; no (5/6), some (1/6) or marked (0/6) improvement]. In all patients, the proposed MRI biomarkers gave evidence of central venous hypertension (PC grades 2-4).
   Microsurgical cyst removal provided marked symptom relief in symptomatic individuals with non-hydrocephalic PCs and MRI biomarkers of central venous hypertension. The hypothesis that PC-induced crowding of the pineal recess may compromise venous run-off and induce a central venous hypertension syndrome deserves further study.

TI Unexpected occlusion of the contralateral transverse sinus after
   stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB A woman in her thirties with intracranial hypertension underwent stenting of the right transverse-sigmoid (TS) junction with resolution of the pressure gradient. Due to persisting symptoms at follow-up, she underwent a repeat study showing a patent right TS stent but the non-dominant left transverse sinus, patent on initial studies, was now completely occluded. According to the positive feedback loop hypothesis, stenting of the right transverse sinus should have resulted in a reduction in intracranial pressures (confirmed by post-stenting lumbar puncture), but also an increase in left transverse sinus diameter, opposed to the occlusion seen on venography. This unexpected finding can be explained by the positive feedback loop hypothesis if a revision is made accounting for intramural venous pressures as an opposing force of venous sinus stenosis, as venous outflow obstruction in the dominant venous sinus pathway provided an increased intramural venous pressure in the non-dominant sinus facilitating patency against extramural pressures.

TI Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis: Update on Diagnosis and Management
SO CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is less frequent than ischemic stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage. Its incidence is comparable to that of acute bacterial meningitis in adults. Because of the increased use of magnetic resonance imaging (MR) for investigating patients with acute and subacute headaches and new onset seizures, CVT are now being diagnosed with increasing frequency. CVT have a more varied clinical presentation than other stroke types as they rarely present as a stroke syndrome. Their most frequent presentations are isolated headache, intracranial hypertension syndrome, seizures, a focal lobar syndrome and encephalopathy. The confirmation of the diagnosis of CVT relies on the demonstration of thrombi in the cerebral veins and/or sinuses by MR/MR venography or veno CT. The more frequent risk factors for CVT are prothrombotic conditions, either genetic or acquired, oral contraceptives, puerperium and pregnancy, infection and malignancy. The prognosis of CVT is in general favourable, as only around 15 % of the patients remain dependent or die. The main intervention in the acute is anticoagulation with either low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin. In patients in severe condition on admission or who deteriorate despite anticoagulation, local thrombolysis or thrombectomy is an option. Decompressive surgery is life-saving in patients with large venous infarcts or haemorrhage. After the acute phase patients remain anticoagulated for a variable period of time, depending on their inherent thrombotic risk. CVT patients may experience recurrent seizures. Prophylaxis with antiepileptics is recommended after the first seizures, in particular in those with hemispheric lesions. There are several ongoing multicentre registries sand trials which will improve evidence-based management of CVT in the near future.

TI Sinus venous stenosis, intracranial hypertension and progression of
   primary headaches
SO NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB The recently advanced hypothesis that idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema (IIHWOP) is a powerful risk factor for the progression of pain in individuals prone to episodic primary headache implies that IIHWOP is much more prevalent than it is believed to be in the general population and that it can run almost asymptomatic in most of the affected individuals. In this review, we discuss the evidence available supporting that: (a) sinus venous stenosis-associated IIHWOP is much more prevalent than believed in the general population and can run without symptoms or signs of raised intracranial pressure in most of individuals affected, (b) sinus venous stenosis is a very sensitive and specific predictor of intermittent or continuous idiopathic intracranial hypertension with or without papilledema, even in asymptomatic individuals, (c) in primary headache prone individuals, a comorbidity with a hidden stenosis-associated IIHWOP represents a very common, although largely underestimated, modifiable risk factor for the progression and refractoriness of headache.

TI Elevated intracranial venous pressure as a universal mechanism in
   pseudotumor cerebri of varying etiologies
SO NEUROLOGY
AB Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a syndrome associated with multiple clinical conditions. We hypothesize that most if not all etiologies result in an increase in intracranial venous pressure as a final common pathway. We studied 10 patients with PTC, Five had dural venous outflow obstruction as demonstrated by venography, and the five remaining patients had normal venous anatomy. Pressure measurements, made during venography in eight patients, all showed elevated pressures. Pressure measurements in the superior sagittal sinus ranged from 13 to 24 mm Hg (mean, 16.6 mm Hg), Patients with obstruction tended to have a high pressure gradient across the stenotic segment, Five patients with normal dural venous anatomy had elevated right atrial pressures (range, 6 to 22 mm Hg; mean, 11.8 mm Hg), which were transmitted up to the intracranial venous sinuses.
   Endovascular techniques, including angioplasty and infusion of thrombolytic agents in some cases, improved outlet obstruction from a hemodynamic perspective but were ineffective in consistently and reliably alleviating the clinical manifestations of PTC. Patients in both groups tended to respond well to conventional CSF diversion procedures.
   Our study suggests that elevated intracranial venous pressure may be a universal mechanism in PTC of different etiologies, This elevated venous pressure leads to elevation in CSF and intracranial pressure by resisting CSF absorption. Although the mechanism leading to venous hypertension in the presence of outflow obstruction is obvious, the etiology of increased intracranial and central systemic venous pressure in PTC remains obscure.

TI Men Are from Mars, Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Is from Venous:
   The Role of Venous Sinus Stenosis and Stenting in Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension
SO SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a disease primarily affecting obese women of child-bearing age, typically presenting with positional headaches, diplopia from abducens nerve palsies, pulse-synchronous tinnitus, and visual disturbances related to papilledema, including transient visual obscurations, blurry vision, and visual field defects. Controversy remains regarding the pathophysiology of IIH. Elevated intracranial pressure in IIH is thought to be the result of a dysregulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, through excessive secretion, reduced drainage, or both. Passive CSF drainage through the arachnoid granulations depends on a pressure gradient between the subarachnoid space and the cerebral venous system, such that elevations in cerebral venous pressure lead to impaired CSF drainage. Dural venous sinus stenosis (DVSS) at the junction of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses, leading to local venous hypertension and a secondary reduction in CSF drainage through the arachnoid granulations, is increasingly recognized as an important component of the pathophysiology of IIH. A growing number of studies have demonstrated a role for stenting of DVSS as an alternative to CSF shunting and optic nerve sheath fenestration in medically refractory IIH patients with vision loss or debilitating symptoms.

TI Optical Hemodynamic Imaging of Jugular Venous Dynamics During Altered
   Central Venous Pressure
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Objective: An optical imaging system is proposed for quantitatively assessing jugular venous response to altered central venous pressure. Methods: The proposed system assesses sub-surface optical absorption changes from jugular venous waveforms with a spatial calibration procedure to normalize incident tissue illumination. Widefield frames of the right lateral neck were captured and calibrated using a novel flexible surface calibration method. A hemodynamic optical model was derived to quantify jugular venous optical attenuation (JVA) signals, and generate a spatial jugular venous pulsatility map. JVA was assessed in three cardiovascular protocols that altered central venous pressure: acute central hypovolemia (lower body negative pressure), venous congestion (head-down tilt), and impaired cardiac filling (Valsalva maneuver). Results: JVA waveforms exhibited biphasic wave properties consistent with jugular venous pulse dynamics when time-aligned with an electrocardiogram. JVA correlated strongly (median, interquartile range) with invasive central venous pressure during graded central hypovolemia (r = 0.85, [0.72, 0.95]), graded venous congestion (r = 0.94, [0.84, 0.99]), and impaired cardiac filling (r = 0.94, [0.85, 0.99]). Reduced JVA during graded acute hypovolemia was strongly correlated with reductions in stroke volume (SV) (r = 0.85, [0.76, 0.92]) from baseline (SV: 79 +/- 15 mL, JVA: 0.56 +/- 0.10 a.u.) to -40 mmHg suction (SV: 59 +/- 18 mL, JVA: 0.47 +/- 0.05 a.u.; p< 0.01). Conclusion: The proposed non-contact optical imaging system demonstrated jugular venous dynamics consistent with invasive central venous monitoring during three protocols that altered central venous pressure. Significance: This system provides non-invasive monitoring of pressure-induced jugular venous dynamics in clinically relevant conditions where catheterization is traditionally required, enabling monitoring in non-surgical environments.

TI Respiratory cerebrospinal fluid flow is driven by the thoracic and
   lumbar spinal pressures
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON
AB Key points
   Respiration plays a key role in the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the central nervous system. During inspiration increased venous return from the cranium is believed to draw CSF rostrally. However, this mechanism does not explain why CSF has also been observed to move caudally during inspiration. We show that during inspiration decreased intrathoracic pressure draws venous blood from the cranium and lumbar spine towards the thorax. We also show that the abdominal pressure was associated with rostral CSF displacement. However, a caudal shift of cervical CSF was seen with low abdominal pressure and comparably negative intrathoracic pressures. These results suggest that the effects of epidural blood flow within the spinal canal need to be considered, as well as the cranial blood volume balance, to understand respiratory-related CSF flow. These results may prove useful for the treatment of CSF obstructive pathology and understanding the behaviour of intrathecal drug injections. It is accepted that during inspiration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows rostrally to compensate for decreased cranial blood volume, caused by venous drainage due to negative intrathoracic pressure. However, this mechanism does not explain observations of caudal CSF displacement during inspiration. Determining the drivers of respiratory CSF flow is crucial for understanding the pathophysiology of CSF flow disorders. To quantify the influence of respiration on CSF flow, real-time phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to record CSF and blood flow, while healthy subjects (5:5 M:F, 25-50 years) performed either a brief expiratory or inspiratory effort between breaths. Transverse images were taken perpendicular to the spinal canal in the middle of the C3 and L2 vertebrae. The same manoeuvres were then performed after a nasogastric pressure catheter was used to measure the intrathoracic and abdominal pressures. During expiratory-type manoeuvres that elevated abdominal and intrathoracic pressures, epidural blood flow into the spinal canal increased and CSF was displaced rostrally. With inspiratory manoeuvres, the negative intrathoracic pressure drew venous blood from C3 and L2 towards the thoracic spinal canal, and cervical CSF was displaced both rostrally and caudally, despite the increased venous drainage. Regression analysis showed that rostral displacement of CSF at both C3 (adjustedR(2) = 0.53;P < 0.001) and L2 (adjustedR(2) = 0.38;P < 0.001) were associated with the abdominal pressure. However, with low abdominal pressure and comparably negative intrathoracic pressure, cervical CSF flowed caudally. These findings suggest that changes in both the cranial and spinal pressures need to be considered to understand respiratory CSF flow.

TI Focal stenosis of the sigmoid sinus causing intracranial venous
   hypertension: Case report, endovascular management, and review of the
   literature
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Regardless of the underlying pathology, elevated intracranial pressure is the endpoint of any impairment in either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption (including arachnoid villi) or intracranial venous drainage. In all age groups, the predominant final common pathway for CSF drainage is the dural venous sinus system. Intracranial venous hypertension (ICVH) is an important vascular cause of intracranial hypertension (and its subsequent sequelae), which has often been ignored due to excessive attention to the arterial system and, specifically, arteriovenous shunts. Various anatomical and pathological entities have been described to cause ICVH. For the second time, we present a unique case of severe focal stenosis in the distal sigmoid sinus associated with concurrent hypoplasia of the contralateral transverse sinus causing a significant pressure gradient and intracranial hypertension, which was treated with endovascular stent placement and angioplasty.

TI Changes it End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressure Alter Venous Sinus
   Pressure Measurements in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: In the diagnosis of venous stenosis associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, previous studies have identified significant differences when venous pressures are measured under conscious sedation versus general anesthesia. No previous reports have investigated the effect that respiratory parameters may have on cerebral venous sinus pressure and the associated trans-stenosis pressure gradient.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension were retrospectively identified from a prospective database wherein venous manometry was performed as part of a venous stenting procedure with wave form recording during changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide level (EtCO2). Upon microcatheterization of the superior sagittal sinus after induction of general anesthesia, both patients were noted to have an EtCO2 of 29 mm Hg. After EtCO2 was corrected to 40 mm Hg, repeat venous manometry was conducted, which demonstrated increased SSS venous pressures from 12.6 to 21.1 mm Hg and 18.4 to 30.3 mm Hg in patients 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, the waveform amplitude increased in both patients after EtCO2 correction.
   CONCLUSIONS: This series demonstrates that EtCO2 changes have an immediate and pronounced effect on venous sinus pressure measurements with waveform changes that may correlate to increased intracranial pressure. These findings underscore the need to perform measurements of venous sinus pressure gradients under normal awake conditions.

SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY PART B-SKULL BASE
AB Background The extent to which intracranial venous sinus obstruction contributes to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is debated. The extent to which extracranial venous obstruction contributes to IIH is virtually unexplored. This article describes an interventional approach to extracranial venous outflow in a group of patients with severe intractable symptoms.
   Objective To describe our technique and experience of styloidectomy combined with jugular stenting in the treatment of skull base narrowing of the jugular veins.
   Methods Retrospective review of all styloidectomies undertaken at our institution (n = 34), as an adjunct or alternative to jugular venous stenting, with a view to improving cranial venous outflow.
   Results Eleven styloidectomies were for delayed complications of jugular stenting. Of seven with stent dysfunction, three were improved and four unchanged. Of seven with accessory nerve compression (three had both), four resolved and three improved. In 23 instances, styloidectomy preceded or obviated jugular stenting. Two had a virtual resolution of symptoms, 13 were improved, and 8 were unchanged.
   Conclusion Styloidectomy can replace, salvage, or complement jugular venous stenting in IIH and disturbances of cranial venous outflow.

   Hypertension-From Physiopathology to Treatment

Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for favorable visual outcomes and to avoid vision loss, but there is also a risk of overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis in many patients with IIH. We also present details about treatment of intracranial hypertension, which is possible in most cases with a combination of weight loss and drug treatments, but also in selected cases with surgical interventions such as optic nerve sheath fenestration, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) diversion, or dural venous sinus stenting for some patients with cerebral venous sinus stenosis, after careful analysis of mechanisms of intracranial hypertension, patient clinical profile, and method risks.

TI Intracranial Venous Pressures Manometry for Patients With Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension: Under Awake Setting or General Anesthesia
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Background and Purpose: Venous sinus stenting (VSS) is a well-acknowledged treatment strategy for patients with a high venous sinus pressure gradient across the site of outflow obstruction. It is not clear whether intracranial venous pressure manometry should be performed awake or under general anesthesia (GA). The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of venous manometry performed under GA or awake setting, and to evaluate stenting candidates to be determined under awake setting or under GA.
   Methods: The manometry results of 32 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) were recorded under awake setting and general anesthesia before stenting. Mean venous pressures (MVPs) and trans-stenosis pressure gradients were obtained and compared between awake setting and general anesthesia status.
   Results: MVPs and trans-stenosis pressure gradients of 32 patients under GA and awake pressure setting were recorded. MVPs in the superior sagittal sinus, torcula, and transverse sinus were lower in the GA group, without statistical significant difference (P > 0.05). MVPs were significantly higher in the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb under GA group (p < 0.05). Mean trans-stenosis pressure gradient was significantly lower in the group under GA (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Intracranial venous pressure seems to be affected by different levels of consciousness. Our study reveals that intracranial venous pressure is lower under general anesthesia than in the awake setting, which may have a potential impact on patient selection for venous sinus stenting.

TI Cerebral venous thrombosis
SO PRESSE MEDICALE
AB Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has an incidence of 1.32/100,000/years in high-income countries, and higher in middle-and low-income countries. CVT is more frequent in infants and children young adults and females, especially during pregnancy/puerperium. CVT are now being diagnosed with increasing frequency because of the increased awareness and higher use of magnetic resonance imaging (MR) for investigating patients with acute and subacute headaches and new onset seizures. CVT rarely present as a stroke syndrome. Their most frequent presentations are isolated headache, intracranial hypertension syndrome, seizures, a lobar syndrome and encephalopathy. The confirmation of the diagnosis of CVT relies on the demonstration of thrombi in the cerebral veins and/or sinuses by MR/MR venography or veno CT. The more frequent risk factors/associated conditions for CVT are genetic prothrombotic conditions, antiphospholipid syndrome and other acquired prothrombotic diseases, including cancer, oral contraceptives, puerperium and pregnancy, infections and trauma. The prognosis of CVT is in general favorable, as acute death rate is below 5% and only 15% of the patients remain dependent or die. Treatment in the acute phase includes management of the associated condition, anticoagulation with either low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin, treatment of intracranial hypertension, prevention of recurrent seizures and headache relief. In patients in severe condition on admission or who deteriorate despite anticoagulation, local thrombolysis or thrombectomy is an option. Decompressive surgery is lifesaving in patients with large venous infarcts or hemorrhage with impending herniation. After the acute phase, patients should anticoagulated for a variable period of time, depending on their inherent thrombotic risk. CVT patients may experience recurrent seizures. Prophylaxis with anti-epileptic drugs is recommended after the first seizure, in those with hemispheric lesions. There are several ongoing multicenter registries and trials, which will improve evidence-based and patient-centered management of CVT in the near future.

TI Dural arteriovenous fistulas as a cause of intracranial hypertension due
   to impairment of cranial venous outflow
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB Objectives - A retrospective study was carried out on 13 patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) who presented with isolated or associated signs of intracranial hypertension.
   Methods - Nine patients presented with symptoms of intracranial hypertension at the time of diagnosis. Ocular fundoscopy available in 12 patients showed bilateral papilloedema in eight and optic disk atrophy in four. Clinical evolution was particularly noticeable in five patients because of chronic (two patients) or acute (after lumbar shunting or puncture: three patients, one death) tonsillar herniation.
   Results - Two patients had a type I fistula (drainage into a sinus, with a normal antegrade flow direction). The remaining 11 had type II fistulas (drainage into a sinus, with abnormal retrograde venous drainage into sinuses or cortical veins). Stenosis or thrombosis of the sinus(es) distal to the fistula was present in five patients. The cerebral venous drainage was abnormal in all patients.
   Conclusion - Type II (and some type I) DAVFs may present as isolated intracranial hypertension mimicking benign intracranial hypertension. Normal cerebral angiography should be added as a fifth criterion of benign intracranial hypertension. The cerebral venous drainage pattern must be carefully studied by contralateral carotid and vertebral artery injections to correctly evaluate the impairment of the cerebral venous outflow. Lumbar CSF diversion (puncture or shunting) may induce acute tonsillar herniation and should be avoided absolutely. DAVF may induce intracranial hypertension, which has a poor long term prognosis and may lead to an important loss of visual acuity and chronic tonsillar herniation. Consequently, patients with intracranial hypertension must be treated, even agressively, to obliterate the fistula or at least to reduce the arterial flow and to restore a normal cerebral venous drainage. The endovascular treatment may associate arterial or transvenous embolisation and/or surgery. Patients in whom the fistula is not obliterated after an endovascular therapeutic procedure, need continous clinical and angiographical follow up.

CT Round Table Meeting on Benign Intracranial Hypertension
CY MAR 30-APR 01, 2007
CL Toulouse, FRANCE
AB Neuroimaging is useful in benign intracranial hypertension (BIH), contributing to its diagnosis criteria and ruling out other causes of intracranial hypertension. CT and/or MR results may be normal or may show small ventricles, an empty sella, or more frequently optic nerve sheath dilatation. Diffusion as well as perfusion MR studies show conflicting results. Venous sinus imaging plays a growing role in BIH evaluation, because impaired cranial venous outflow is a common factor in the pathogenesis of BIH and venous sinus stenosis is frequently observed in this condition. Angiography is not the gold standard for this evaluation: angio-MR (with dynamic sequences) clearly demonstrates venous sinus stenosis (mostly located in the transverse sinus). We believe that this investigation must be carried out in every case of BIH. For medically refractory cases of BIH with associated sinus venous stenosis, sinus pressure recording may be necessary, sometimes leading to endovascular treatment of the stenosis (stenting). The results are promising, but long-term follow-up of these patients is needed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension; immediate resolution of venous

SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB It has been postulated that cerebral venous outflow "obstruction" is a precipitating factor for many cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We describe a 17-year-old woman with IIH, and "venous obstruction" repeatedly demonstrated on magnetic resonance venography (MRV) that within minutes resolved partially when the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was reduced to 11 cmH(2)O and completely when the pressure was reduced to 8 cmH(2)O. These findings further support the view that raised pressure is the cause of the "obstruction". rather than the obstruction being the primary cause of the IIH. It also raises questions about how low the CSF pressure should be reduced at therapeutic lumbar puncture. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Non-invasive Ventilation and High-Flow Nasal Cannula in Head/Brain
   Injury with Risk of Pneumocephalus: Is There a Potential Application?
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY AND REANIMATION
AB Non-invasive ventilation application in neurocritical care with risk of pneumocephalus is controversial. Non-invasive ventilation-related increased intrathoracic pressure increases intracranial pressure via direct transmission of intrathoracic pressure to the intracranial cavity. In addition, increased thoracic pressure decreases venous return to the heart and increases vena jugularis interna pressure, thereby increasing cerebral blood volume.
   Pneumocephalus is one of the major concerns after non-invasive ventilation application in head/brain trauma patients. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation may be performed in limited conditions in head trauma/brain surgery with appropriate and close monitoring. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy can provide higher FiO(2) as manifested by a larger increase in PaO2/FiO(2) ratio and provide the theoretical basis in pneumocephalus because augmenting the PaO2 more effectively would accelerate nitrogen (N-2) washout.
   As a result, non-invasive mechanical ventilation may be performed in limited manner in head trauma/ brain surgery with appropriate and close monitoring.

TI Cerebral venous pressures, sinus trans-stenosis gradients, and

SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Cerebral venous pressures, sinus trans-stenosis gradients, and intracranial pressures are thought to be influenced by head position.Objective To investigate the intracranial manifestations of these changes in patients with cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVD).Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted on 22 consecutive adult patients who underwent diagnostic cerebral venography with rotational internal jugular vein (IJV) venography and superior sagittal sinus (SSS) pressure measurements in multiple head positions. Data on venous sinus pressures, IJV pressures, and lumbar puncture (LP) opening pressures (OP) were collected and analyzed.Results The study found that 21 (96%) patients experienced increases in SSS pressures with head rotation, with a mean increase of 25.4%. Intracranial trans-stenosis gradients showed significant variability with head position. Additionally, LP OP measurements increased by an average of 44.3% with head rotation. Dynamic IJV stenosis was observed in all patients during rotational testing.Conclusion Head position significantly affects cerebral venous pressures, trans-stenosis gradients, and intracranial pressures in patients with CVD or intracranial hypertension. These findings highlight the need for dynamic venography in the diagnostic evaluation of these conditions to better understand their pathophysiology and improve treatment strategies.

SP Soc Neurosurg Anesthesia & Crit Care
AB Previous studies have shown that laparoscopic interventions are associated with increases in intracranial pressure. However, the consequences on cerebral blood flow (CBF) are unknown. This study investigates the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneum on CBF in pigs. Ten pigs (weight, 20-26 kg) were anesthetized with 1.4% isoflurane and fentanyl (1 mug/kg per minute). Mechanical ventilation (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.4) was set to maintain normocapnia (end-tidal CO2 tension = 35 mm Hg). Arterial and central venous catheters were placed for measurement of mean arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure. Bilateral internal carotid artery blood flow was measured using two transient time flow probes placed around both carotid arteries (with ligated external carotid arteries). Cortical and subcortical cerebral blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. Sagittal sinus pressure was measured via a superior sagittal sinus catheter. After baseline measurements, the peritoneal cavity of the animals was insufflated with CO2 to achieve an intraabdominal pressure of 12-mm Hg. After 10 minutes of stable CO2, pneumoperitoneum measurements were repeated. Increases in central venous pressure (6.3 +/- 2.1 to 11.1 +/- 3.0 mm Hg) and sagittal sinus pressure (8.0 +/- 2.8 to 11.9 +/- 3.0 mm Hg) were noted during CO2 pneumoperitoneum (P < .05). Bilateral internal carotid artery blood flow (46.0 +/- 7.4 vs 47.7 +/- 7.1 mL/100g per minute), cortical CBF (263 +/- 115 vs 259 +/- 158 tissue perfusion units), and subcortical CBF (131 +/- 145 vs 133 +/- 149 tissue perfusion units) did not change during CO2 pneumoperitoneum. The current data show that CO2 pneumoperitoneum increases sagittal sinus pressure without changing CBF. Increases in sagittal sinus pressure are likely related to decreases in cerebral venous drainage caused by increases in intraabdominal pressure.

TI Venous collapse regulates intracranial pressure in upright body
   positions
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY
AB Recent interest in intracranial pressure (ICP) in the upright posture has revealed that the mechanisms regulating postural changes in ICP are not fully understood. We have suggested an explanatory model where the postural changes in ICP depend on well-established hydrostatic effects in the venous system and where these effects are interrupted by collapse of the internal jugular veins (IJVs) in more upright positions. The aim of this study was to investigate this relationship by simultaneous invasive measurements of ICP, venous pressure, and IJV collapse in healthy volunteers. ICP (monitored via the lumbar route), central venous pressure (peripherally inserted central catheter line), and IJV cross-sectional area (ultrasound) were measured in 11 healthy volunteers (47 +/- 10 yr, mean +/- SD) in 7 positions, from supine to sitting (0-69 degrees). Venous pressure and anatomical distances were used to predict ICP in accordance with the explanatory model, and IJV area was used to assess IJV collapse. The hypothesis was tested by comparing measured ICP with predicted ICP. Our model accurately described the general behavior of the observed postural ICP changes (mean difference, -0.03 +/- 2.7 mmHg). No difference was found between predicted and measured ICP for any tilt angle (P values, 0.65-0.94). The results support the hypothesis that postural ICP changes are governed by hydrostatic effects in the venous system and IJV collapse. This improved understanding of postural ICP regulation may have important implications for the development of better treatments for neurological and neurosurgical conditions affecting ICP.

TI Assessment of blood flow velocities and venous pressures using a
   dual-sensor guidewire in symptomatic dural sinus stenoses
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Lateral venous sinus stenoses have been associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and venous pulsatile tinnitus. Venous pressure measurement is traditionally performed to assess the indications for stenting in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. However, its reliability has recently been questioned by many authors. The dualsensor guidewire was first developed for advanced physiological assessment of fractional and coronary flow reserves in coronary artery stenoses. It allows measurement of both venous pressure and blood flow velocities. The authors used this device in 14 consecutively treated patients to explore for symptomatic lateral sinus stenosis. They found that venous blood flow was significantly accelerated inside the stenotic lesion. This acceleration, as well as the pulsatile tinnitus, resolved in all patients following stent placement. According to the authors' results, this guidewire can be helpful for establishing an indication for stenting in patients with pulsatile tinnitus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

TI CHANGE OF INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE IN NEUROSURGICAL PATIENTS BY
   HYPERVENTILATION, POSITIVE NEGATIVE-PRESSURE VENTILATION AND PEEP
SO ANAESTHESIST
AB The effects of a hyperventilation, positive negative pressure ventilation (PNPV) and ventilation using positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) on intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured in 24 patients suffering from different neurosurgical disorders. The patients were given a basic anesthesia including muscle relaxation. Apparently, hyperventilation followed by a PCO2 of 26 and 30 torr, lowered intracranial pressure. The pressure drop was more pronounced when the preexisting ICP was high than when it was low due to the form of the compliance curve of the brain. PNPV lowered intracranial pressure, but a harmful effect of this technique on lung function and structure is known. Its use is justified only for short periods and in addition to other measures for lowering ICP. PNPV possesses limited beneficial properties with regard to the present topic. Ventilation by PEEP significantly increased ICP. This technique is to be employed with caution in neurosurgery. Arterial pressure (radial artery) and central venous pressure (subclavian vein) were also recorded.

TI Intracranial venous pressures under conscious sedation and general
   anesthesia
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Introduction Venous outflow obstruction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a subset of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), and venous sinus stenting (VSS) has emerged as an effective treatment. However, the effect of anesthesia on venous sinus pressure measurements is unpredictable. A more thorough understanding of the effect of the level of anesthesia on intracranial venous pressures might help to better define patients who might benefit most from stent placement.
   Objective To compare, in a retrospective cohort study, intracranial venous pressures measured under conscious (CS) sedation versus general anesthesia (GA) and to assess the relationship between anesthetic-dependent venous pressures and outcomes after VSS.
   Methods We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database to identify patients undergoing angiographic evaluation and VSS for intracranial venous stenosis. Mean venous pressures (MVPs) and trans-stenosis pressure gradients obtained under CS were compared with those measured under GA.
   Results The maximal MVP was significantly lower under GA (19.8 mm Hg) than CS (21.9 mm Hg; p=0.029). The MVPs in the superior sagittal sinus, torcula, and transverse sinus were lower under GA, but were significantly higher in the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb under GA (p<0.001). The mean trans-stenosis pressure gradient was also significantly lower under GA (8.6 mm Hg) than CS (12.1 mm Hg; p<0.001). Patients with a larger difference between maximum MVP under GA versus CS were more likely to have normalization of the MVP after VSS (p=0.0008).
   Conclusions Intracranial venous pressures are markedly affected by GA. In order to obtain an accurate measurement of MVPs and trans-stenosis gradients, patients undergoing investigation for IIH should undergo cerebral angiography and venous manometry under CS, which provides more reliable data for outcomes after VSS.

TI Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation on cerebral
   venous pressure with head elevation in dogs
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may prevent venous air embolism in the sitting position because cerebral venous pressure (Pcev) could be increased by the PEEP-induced increase in right atrial pressure (Pra). Whereas it is clear that there is a linear transmission of the PEEP-induced increase in Pra to Pcev while the dog is in the prone position, the mechanism of the transmission with the dog in the head-elevated position is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that a Starling resistor-type mechanism exists in the jugular veins when the head is elevated. In one group of dogs, increasing PEEP linearly increased Pcev with the dog in the prone position (head at heart level, slope = 0.851) but did not increase Pcev when the head was elevated. In another group of dogs, an external chest binder was used to produce a larger PEEP-induced increase in Pra. Further increasing Pra increased Pcev only after Pra exceeded a pressure of 19 mmHg (break pressure). This sharp inflection in the upstream (Pcev)-downstream (Pra) relationship suggests that this may be caused by a Starling resistor-type mechanism. We conclude that jugular venous collapse serves as a significant resistance in the transmission of Pra to Pcev in the head-elevated position.

TI Acute treatment of cerebral venous and dural sinus thrombosis
SO CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Management of thrombosis of the dural sinus and cerebral veins (CVT) includes treatment of the underlying condition, antithrombotic treatment, symptomatic treatment, and the prevention or treatment of complications.
   Intravenous heparin or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin should be used in acute CVT to prevent thrombus propagation and pulmonary embolism and to increase the chances of recanalization. Anticoagulation is safe and can be used in patients with acute CVT who have intracranial hemorrhagic lesions.
   Endovascular thrombolysis (with or without mechanical thrombus disruption) is an experimental treatment to be used in experienced centers for severe cases or patients who fail to improve on anti coagulation. Local thrombolysis is not useful in patients with large infarcts and impending herniation.
   In patients with severe headache and papilledema, intracranial hypertension can be reduced and symptoms relieved through a therapeutic lumbar puncture. Hemicraniectomy may be lifesaving in patients with parenchymal lesions leading to herniation.
   In patients with acute seizures and supratentorial lesions, antiepileptic drugs should be prescribed. Prophylactic use of these drugs can also be considered for patients with one of these risk factors but should be avoided in patients with neither of them.
   To reduce the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis of the limbs, vitamin K antagonists are given for a variable period depending on the patient's inherent risk of thrombosis, aiming at an International Normalized Ratio of 2 to 3.5. If CVT is related to a transient risk factor (eg, pregnancy, infection), we recommend anticoagulants for 3 months. in patients with idiopathic CVT or CVT associated with "mild" thrombophilia, the period of anticoagulation must be extended to 6 to 12 months. In patients with "severe" thrombophilia (eg, two or more prothrombotic abnormalities or antiphospholipid syndrome), anticoagulants should be given for life.
   Patients with persistent symptoms of increased intracranial hypertension, visual loss, or both can be treated with repeated lumbar punctures or a lumbo-peritoneal shunt.
   For the prevention of remote seizures, antiepileptic drugs are recommended for patients with seizures in the acute phase and for those who experience a seizure after the acute phase. These drugs can also be considered for patients without seizures who have supratentorial hemorrhagic lesions or motor deficits.

TI Acute kidney dysfunction secondary to the abdominal, compartment
   syndrome
SO JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY
AB The abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) occurs most commonly in the setting of major trauma and complex abdominal surgical procedures. The syndrome reflects the adverse physiological consequences of an acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure (generally > 18 mm Hg). The effects of increased abdominal pressures on the kidney were initially described in 1876 and include impairment of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration resulting in oliguria or anuria and acute kidney dysfunction. These effects are magnified by the concomitant effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure to impair venous return and cardiac output. Patients with intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) can be easily detected using simple methodology. If employed early, abdominal decompression to lower IAH is associated with restoration of organ function and avoidance of the ACS. However, the overall mortality associated with this syndrome remains high. In postsurgical, trauma patients, or those at risk, ACS should be considered as a potential etiology for acute kidney dysfunction and intra-abdominal pressures should be measured, monitored and when necessary intervened upon in order to attempt to improve organ dysfunction.

TI The influence of intra-abdominal hypertension on the central nervous
   system: Current insights and clinical recommendations, is it all in the
   head?
SO ACTA CLINICA BELGICA
CT 3rd World Congress on Abdominal Compartment Syndrome
CY MAR 22-24, 2007
CL Antwerp, BELGIUM
SP World Soc Abdominal Compartment Syndrome, NiekenhuisNetwerk Antwerpen, Dept Intens Care Med
AB Introduction: Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome are a common occurrence in ICU patients. The deleterious effects of IAH on organ function are well known and increasingly appreciated in recent years, especially where renal and respiratory function are concerned.
   Methods: This review will focus on the available literature from the lastyears. A Medline and PubMed search was performed in order to find an answer to the question "What is the impact of increased IAP on neurologic function in the critically ill?
   Results: The amount of data on the influence of IAH on the central nervous system is more scarce, but several animal and human studies have demonstrated a clear correlation between intraabdominal pressure (IAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP). This correlation is probably due to transmission of the increased IAP to the thorax leading to increased intrathoracic, pleural pressure and central venous pressure, decreased venous return from the brain and increased ICP. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the increase in ICP is abolished when a sternotomy and pleuropericardotomy are performed, and by the fact that abdominal decompression has produced good results in treating refractory intracranial hypertension (ICH) in patients with both IAH and ICH.
   Conclusions: A close relationship between IAP and ICP has been observed in several animal and human studies. The clinical impact of this association is dependent on the baseline ICP and the compensatory reserve of the patient. Some studies have reported good results in treating refractory ICH by abdominal decompression in patients with concomitant IAH. Monitoring of IAP and ICP in risk patients is essential.

TI Induced abdominal compartment syndrome increases intracranial pressure
   in neurotrauma patients: A prospective study
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB pObjective: To evaluate the effect of a stepwise increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on intracranial pressure (ICP) and to further define the pressure transmission characteristics of different body compartments.
   Design: A prospective, nonrandomized study.
   Setting: A multidisciplinary intensive care unit at a university medical center.
   Patients: Fifteen patients with moderate-to-severe head injury.
   Interventions: All patients were studied after the initial stabilization and resolution of intracranial hypertension. Measurements were carried out before and 20 mins after IAP was increased by positioning a soft, 15-L water bag on the patient's abdomen.
   Measurements and Main Results: Placing weights upon the abdomen generated a significant increase in IAP, which rose from 4.7 +/- 2.9 to 15.5 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (p < .001). The rise in IAP caused concomitant and rapid increases in central venous pressure (from 6.2 +/- 2.4 to 10.4 +/- 2.9 mm Hg; p < .001), internal jugular pressure (from 11.9 +/- 3.2 to 14.3 +/- 2.4 mm Hg; p < .001), and ICP (from 12.0 +/- 4.2 to 15.5 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; p < .001). Thoracic transmural pressure, calculated as the difference between central venous pressure and esophageal pressure, remained constant during the protocol. Respiratory system compliance decreased from 58.9 +/- 9.8 to 44.9 +/- 9.4 mL/cm H2O (p < .001) in all patients because of decreased chest wall compliance. The mean arterial pressure increased from 94 +/- 11 to 100 +/- 13 mm Hg (p < .01), which allowed the maintenance of a stable cerebral perfusion pressure (82.4 +/- 10.3 vs. 84.7 +/- 11.5 mm Hg; p = NS) despite the ICP increase.
   Conclusions: Increased IAP causes a significant rise in ICP in head trauma patients. This effect seems to be the result of an increase in intrathoracic pressure, which causes a functional obstruction to cerebral venous outflow. Routine assessment of IAP may help clinicians to identify remediable causes of increased ICP. Caution should be used when applying laparoscopic techniques in neurotrauma patients.

TI EFFECT OF INTERMITTENT PNEUMATIC LEG COMPRESSION ON
   INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE IN BRAIN-INJURED PATIENTS
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective. To evaluate the effect of intermittent pneumatic leg compression on intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure in brain-injured patients.
   Design: Prospective, sequential patient study.
   Setting. Surgical/trauma ICU of a community hospital providing regional trauma care.
   Patients. Twenty-four adult, brain-injured patients (mean Glasgow Coma Scale score = 6) who required hemodynamic and intracranial pressure monitoring.
   Interventions: Placement of intermittent sequential pneumatic leg compression devices for prevention of venous thrombosis.
   Measurements. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, central venous pressure, and intracranial pressure were measured at baseline, and at 0, 10, 20, and 30 mins of intermittent pneumatic leg compression. Cerebral perfusion pressure was calculated as the difference between MAP and intracranial pressure.
   Results. No significant changes in MAP, central venous pressure, or intracranial pressure occurred during the study interval. Calculated cerebral perfusion pressure remained unchanged. A total of 23 of 24 study patients had intracranial pressure controlled by hyperventilation or pharmacologic measures within the normal range at the time of study.
   Conclusion: Intermittent pneumatic leg compression results in no significant changes in intracranial pressure or cerebral perfusion pressure in stable, brain-injured patients who have intracranial pressure controlled by medical means.

TI Intra-ocular pressure changes during maximal isometric contraction: Does
   this reflect intra-cranial pressure or retinal venous pressure?
SO NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB Recent publications have suggested that intra-ocular pressure (IOP) may be an indirect assessment of intracranial pressure (ICP). Both IOP and ICP have similar physiologic pressure ranges and similar responses to changes in intra-abdominal, intra-thoracic and aortic pressure. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationships between retinal arterial pressure and aortic pressure, intra-ocular pressure and retinal venous pressure, intra-cranial pressure and retinal venous pressure. Power athletes routinely utilize the Valsalva maneuver during weightlifting. In fact there are reports of stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, conjunctival, foveal and retinal hemorrhage, retinal detachment, hiatal hernia and pneumothorax associated with weightlifting. These events are thought to occur secondary to the extreme pressure elevations that occur in the intra-abdominal, intra-thoracic, intra-cranial, intra-ocular and vascular compartments. To date no human studies have examined the IOP changes that may occur with heavy resistance exercise. Therefore, we recruited power athletes (n = 11), who had participated in prior studies, from the local metropolitan area. The athletes had blood pressure status, drug screening and medical histories performed during previous investigations. Intra-ocular pressure was measured by noncontact tonometry at rest and during maximal isometric contraction. All subjects resting IOP were within normal ranges (mean 13 +/- 2.8 mmHg). Intra-ocular pressures were significantly (p < 0.0007) elevated in each subject during maximal contraction (mean 28 +/-. 9.3 mmHg). One subject's IOP reached 46 mmHg during maximal contraction. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant linear relationship (r = 0.62, p < 0.0001) in the net change of IOP from rest to maximal contraction for each subject This study demonstrates that IOP elevates to pathophysiologic levels during resistance exercise. The findings of conjunctival hemorrhages in two subjects further supports IOP being reflective of retinal venous pressure. The enormous pressures generated by power athletes during weightlifting leads to elevations in ICP which obstruct venous outflow leading to hemorrhage and elevations in IOP. The question remains as to whether these intermittent bursts of elevated IOP can lead to long-term pathological sequelae.

TI Decompression of superior vena cava during bidirectional Glenn shunt
SO ANNALS OF CARDIAC ANAESTHESIA
AB Patients undergoing bi-directional Glenn shunt for various congenital anomalies of the heart will have their superior vena cava (SVC) clamped during the procedure. The duration of the procedure is variable, ranging from five to 30 minutes. This can affect the cerebral perfusion due to raised venous pressure [Cerebral blood flow = Mean arterial pressure - (Intracranial pressure + Central venous pressure)]. Shunting away the SVC blood is a well known technique to counter this problem, but we describe two cases where a novel technique was successfully used to decompress the SVC.

TI Intracranial pressure waveform analysis: Computation of pressure
   transmission and waveform shape indicators
SO NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB We studied transmission of arterial blood pressure to intracranial pressure by observing how the two pressure waveforms varied from baseline conditions to after postural change or jugular compression. Such experiments may lead to pressure waveform-based estimates of intracranial compliance. Using a single database of arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, and intracranial pressure waveforms collected during baseline, jugular compresison, and head-elevated conditions from six Yucatan minipigs, we computed several numerical indicators of waveform shape to find an estimator of intracranial compliance. Of these indicators, two were based on the Fourier-decomposition of all three waveforms, and one was based on a new method for approximating the systolic slope of the intracranial pressure waveform. We computed amplitude transfer functions for the first six harmonics of the Fourier spectrum, treating intracranial pressure as system output and independently treating arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure as system inputs. Using these same inputs and outputs, we computed a single quotient based on the Fourier coefficients of the first six harmonics of the input and output waveforms. Finally, applying a Gaussian high-pass filter, we computed systolic slope approximations for all intracranial pressure wave cycles contained in a single respiratory cycle. Our third indicator was the mean-normalized variation of the slope approximations over a respiratory cycle. We studied how each composite at baseline vaned with baseline mean intracranial pressure and how each composite changed from baseline as a result of a physical manipulation. Our analysis suggests;hat the composite based on respiratory variation of systolic slope approximations was positively correlated with mean intracranial pressure during baseline. The quotient based on Fourier coefficients with arterial blood pressure input seemed to increase from baseline to jugular compression. Composites that treated central venous pressure as input were both less correlated with mean intracranial pressure during baseline and exhibited less predictable changes from baseline to a physical manipulation than their counterparts that used arterial blood pressure as input. However, none of these apparent trends was statistically significant. The lack of statistically significant results may be due to the nature of the composites and/or the small sample size (n = 6). However, we hope this study stimulates further investigation of both central venous pressure-to-intracranial pressure (in addition to arterial blood pressure-to-intracranial pressure) transfer and automated computation of intracranial pressure waveform systolic slope. Such research may lead to noninvasively determined estimators of intracranial compliance.

TI Central Venous Obstruction-Induced Intracranial Hypertension in
   Hemodialysis Patients: An Underrecognized Cause of Elevated Intracranial
   Pressure
SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Background: Central venous obstruction (stenosis or occlusion) is common in patients with renal failure on hemodialysis and may be associated with intracranial hypertension (IH). Causes include vein injury from an endoluminal device, lumen obstruction from a device or thrombus, external vein compression, and high venous flow leading to vein intimal hyperplasia. A combination of high venous flow and central venous obstruction can lead to intracranial venous hypertension, impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption, and subsequent IH. Evidence Acquisition: We conducted a search of the English literature using the Ovid MEDLINE Database and PubMed, with a focus on reports involving IH and central venous obstruction in the setting of hemodialysis. We reviewed CSF flow dynamics, the risk factors and causes of central venous obstruction, and the evaluation, management, and outcomes of central venous obstruction-induced IH. Results: Twenty-four cases of IH related to central venous obstruction in hemodialysis patients were identified. Twenty patients had headaches (83.3%) and 9 had visual symptoms (37.5%). The brachiocephalic vein was the most common site of stenosis or occlusion (20/24, 83.3%). Twenty-one patients (87.5%) had resolution of IH with treatment. Two patients died from complications of IH (8.3%). Conclusions: Central venous obstruction-induced IH is likely underrecognized by clinicians and mimics idiopathic IH. Hemodialysis patients with IH should be screened with computed tomography venography of the chest. Optimal treatment is with vascular intervention or a CSF diversion procedure and can help prevent vision loss from papilledema or nervous system damage. Medical management may be appropriate in mild cases or as a bridge to definitive interventional treatment. Increased awareness among clinicians has potential to facilitate the timely diagnosis of this treatable condition with potential for good neurologic and visual outcomes.

TI Reducing intracranial pressure by reducing central venous pressure:
   assessment of potential countermeasures to spaceflight-associated
   neuro-ocular syndrome
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) involves unilateral or bilateral optic disc edema, widening of the optic nerve sheath, and posterior globe flattening. Owing to posterior globe flattening, it is hypothesized that microgravity causes a disproportionate change in intracranial pressure (ICP) relative to intraocular pressure. Countermeasures capable of reducing ICP include thigh cuffs and breathing against inspiratory resistance. Owing to the coupling of central venous pressure (CVP) and intracranial pressure, we hypothesized that both ICP and CVP will be reduced during both countermeasures. In four male participants (32 +/- 13 yr) who were previously implanted with Ommaya reservoirs for treatment of unrelated clinical conditions, ICP was measured invasively through these ports. Subjects were healthy at the time of testing. CVP was measured invasively by a peripherally inserted central catheter. Participants breathed through an impedance threshold device (ITD, -7 cmH(2)O) to generate negative intrathoracic pressure for 5 min, and subsequently, wore bilateral thigh cuffs inflated to 30 mmHg for 2 min. Breathing through an ITD reduced both CVP (6 +/- 2 vs. 3 +/- 1mmHg; P = 0.02) and ICP (16 +/- 3 vs. 12 +/- 1 mmHg; P = 0.04) compared to baseline, a result that was not observed during the free breathing condition (CVP, 6 +/- 2 vs. 6 +/- 2 mmHg, P = 0.87; ICP, 15 +/- 3 vs. 15 +/- 4 mmHg, P = 0.68). Inflation of the thigh cuffs to 30 mmHg caused no meaningful reduction in CVP in all four individuals (5 +/- 4 vs. 5 +/- 4 mmHg; P = 0.1), coincident with minimal reduction in ICP (15 +/- 3 vs. 14 +/- 4 mmHg; P = 0.13). The application of inspiratory resistance breathing resulted in reductions in both ICP and CVP, likely due to intrathoracic unloading.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Spaceflight causes pathological changes in the eye that may be due to the absence of gravitational unloading of intracranial pressure (ICP) under microgravity conditions commonly referred to as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), whereby countermeasures aimed at lowering ICP are necessary. These data show that impedance threshold breathing acutely reduces ICP via a reduction in central venous pressure (CVP). Whereas, acute thigh cuff inflation, a popular known spaceflight-associated countermeasure, had little effect on ICP and CVP.

TI Functional Cerebral Venous Outflow in Swine and Baboon: Feasibility of
   an Intracranial Venous Hypertension Model
SO JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
AB Introduction: To evaluate the feasibility of performing a functional cerebral venous outflow blockage in two large animals species, the swine and the baboon, for elaboration of venous hypertension models. Method: Cerebral venous outflow pathways were identified on angiogram and venography of three swine and two baboons, and potential approaches to access these structures were assessed. Practicability of performing functional intracranial dural outflow blockage was tested. Results: The main cerebral venous outflow route was the internal jugular vein in baboons and the paraspinal venous network in swine. Both animals had an additional venous outflow structure, the petrosquamous sinus. Access to intracranial venous sinuses was achieved through a percutaneous retrograde approach in baboon but not in swine, due to the absence of a direct connection between the dural structures and the internal jugular vein. A transcranial approach allowed to access dural venous structures in swine. In both models, partial and progressive venous sinus occlusion increased intracranial pressure, while preserving the animal's vital status. At 6 months, all animals are alive with no neurological deficits. Conclusion: Functional venous dural outflow blockage for elaboration of intracranial venous hypertension is feasible in both models. To be effective, the sinus blockage must be performed before the origin of the petrosquamous, an additional venous sinus seen in swine and baboon. The baboon has the greatest advantage of resembling human cerebral venous drainage, which enables an intracranial venous retrograde access. However, the transcranial approach remains a valuable option to access intracranial venous sinuses in swine.

TI Cerebral Venous Thrombosis: Clinical, Radiological, Biological, and
   Etiological Characteristics of a French Prospective Cohort
   (FPCCVT)-Comparison With ISCVT Cohort
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Introduction: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare disease with highly variable clinical presentation and outcome. Etiological assessment may be negative. The clinical and radiological presentation and evolution can be highly variable. The mechanisms involved in this variability remain unknown.Objective: The aim of this multicenter French study registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02013635) was therefore to prospectively recruit a cohort of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (FPCCVT) in order to study thrombin generation and clot degradation, and to evaluate their influence on clinical radiological characteristics. The first part of the study was to compare our cohort with a reference cohort.Methods: This prospective, multicenter, French study was conducted from July 2011 to September 2016. Consecutive patients (aged >15 years) referred to the stroke units of 21 French centers and who had a diagnosis of symptomatic CVT were included. All patients gave their written informed consent. The diagnosis of CVT had to be confirmed by imaging. Clinical, radiological, biological, and etiological characteristics were recorded at baseline, at acute phase, at 3 months and at last follow-up visit. Thrombophilia screening and the choice of treatment were performed by the attending physician. All data were compared with data from the International Study on CVT published by Ferro et al.Results: Two hundred thirty-one patients were included: 117 (50.6%) had isolated intracranial hypertension, 96 (41.5%) had focal syndrome. During hospitalization, 229 (99.1%) patients received anticoagulant treatment. Median length of hospital stay was 10 days. Five patients died during hospitalization (2.2%). At 3 months, 216 patients (97.0%) had follow-up with neurological data based on an outpatient visit. The mean duration of antithrombotic treatment was 9 months, and the mean time to last follow-up was 10.5 months. At the end of follow-up, eight patients had died, and 26 patients were lost to follow-up. At least one risk factor was identified in 200 patients.Conclusions: We demonstrated that the FPCCVT cohort had radiological, biological, and etiological characteristics similar to the historical ISCVT cohort. Nevertheless, the initial clinical presentation was less severe in our study probably due to an improvement in diagnostic methods between the two studies.

TI Impact of Altered Airway Pressure on Intracranial Pressure, Perfusion,
   and Oxygenation: A Narrative Review
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objectives: A narrative review of the pathophysiology linking altered airway pressure and intracranial pressure and cerebral oxygenation.
   Data Sources: Online search of PubMed and manual review of articles (laboratory and patient studies) of the altered airway pressure on intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion, or cerebral oxygenation.
   Study Selection: Randomized trials, observational and physiologic studies.
   Data Extraction: Our group determined by consensus which resources would best inform this review.
   Data Synthesis: In the normal brain, positive-pressure ventilation does not significantly alter intracranial pressure, cerebral oxygenation, or perfusion. In injured brains, the impact of airway pressure on intracranial pressure is variable and determined by several factors; a cerebral venous Starling resistor explains much of the variability. Negative-pressure ventilation can improve cerebral perfusion and oxygenation and reduce intracranial pressure in experimental models, but data are limited, and mechanisms and clinical benefit remain uncertain.
   Conclusions: The effects of airway pressure and ventilation on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation are increasingly understood, especially in the setting of brain injury. In the face of competing mechanisms and priorities, multimodal monitoring and individualized titration will increasingly be required to optimize care.

TI The compartment syndrome of the abdominal cavity: A state of the art
   review
SO JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Abdominal compartment syndrome gains increasing recognition. It impairs physiology and requires treatment. It occurs more commonly with acute rather than chronic abdominal hypertension. Functional impairments involve the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, hepatic, renal, and gastrointestinal function, and intracranial pressure. Abdominal hypertension decreases venous return, increases systemic vascular resistance and intrathoracic pressure, and therefore reduces cardiac output. It also adversely affects cardiovascular monitoring. Tn the presence of increased abdominal pressure, atelectasis and pneumonia are likely to develop and impaired ventilation may lead to respiratory failure. Also, blued flow to the liver and kidney may be reduced, resulting in functional impairment of both organs. The adverse effects on gastrointestinal function result from impairing lymphatic, venous, and arterial flow. Anastomotic healing may become a problem under these circumstances. Decreased venous return through the inferior vena cava in obese patients may lead to venous stasis ulcers and hemorrhage. The correlation of increased intracranial pressure and intra-abdominal pressure may be a problem for trauma patients with simultaneous injuries to the head and the abdomen. There are three severity grades of increased intra-abdominal pressure: Acute sustained elevation of intra-abdominal pressure above 10-20 mmHg is called mild abdominal hypertension. Physiologic effects are generally well compensated and usually clinically nonsignificant. Nonoperative therapy may be required. Moderate hypertension is defined as sustained elevation of 21-35 mmHg. Therapy is generally necessary. Surgical abdominal decompression may be critical. Severe hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome is defined as sustained elevation above 35 mmHg. Operative decompression is always indicated. The gap between the abdominal wound edges must be temporarily covered to prevent fascia retraction and formation of a huge hernia. All detrimental effects of elevated intra-abdominal pressure and the methods and benefits of its decompression have been well studied, both in the laboratory. and in clinical practice. Diagnostic suspicion may be confirmed with objective measurements of intra-abdominal pressure to select patients who may benefit from decompression. Operative decompression is achieved by abdominal fasciotomy and covering the fascial gap with mesh made of Marlex(R), Gore-Tex(R), silastic, or by a Velcro-like closure mesh (artificial bur), All meshes help to effectively decompress the abdomen. The artificial bur offers further advantages by permitting successive reapproximation of the fascia until final fascial closure, and avoiding the fistula and hernia formation seen with the other meshes.

TI Dural venous sinus stenting in patients with idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension: report of outcomes from a single-center prospective
   database and literature review
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB IntroductionIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease of excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leading to rising intracranial pressure. Patients most commonly present with headache, tinnitus, papilledema, and vision loss. It most commonly affects young overweight females, a growing population. Traditional management has consisted of weight loss, medical management, surgical CSF diversion, and optic nerve sheath fenestration. In recent years, cerebral venous sinus stenosis has been described as an almost ubiquitously present potentiator of this disease. Venous sinus stenting to normalize cerebral venous outflow has emerged as a highly effective treatment.Areas coveredIn this review, the authors review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of IIH, as well as its common management strategies. The authors focus on the emergence of venous sinus stenting as a safe, effective, and minimally invasive strategy for managing IIH.Expert opinionIIH caused by venous sinus stenosis can be treated effectively and safely with endovascular stenting of the sinus. Given its low morbidity and failure rate relative to other traditional management strategies, evaluation for venous sinus stenosis should be pursued in this patient population, and referral to a neuro-endovascular specialist made if indicated.

TI Venous sinus stenting for reduction of intracranial pressure in IIH: a
   prospective pilot study
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) may cause blindness due to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Venous sinus stenosis has been identified in select patients, leading to stenting as a potential treatment, but its effects on global ICP have not been completely defined. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of venous sinus stenting on ICP in a small group of patients with IIH.
   METHODS Ten patients for whom medical therapy had failed were prospectively followed. Ophthalmological examinations were assessed, and patients with venous sinus stenosis on MR angiography proceeded to catheter angiography, venography with assessment of pressure gradient, and ICP monitoring. Patients with elevated ICP measurements and an elevated pressure gradient across the stenosis were treated with stent placement.
   RESULTS All patients had elevated venous pressure (mean 39.5 +/- 14.9 mm Hg), an elevated gradient across the venous sinus stenosis (30.0 +/- 13.2 mm Hg), and elevated ICP (42.2 +/- 15.9 mm Hg). Following stent placement, all patients had resolution of the stenosis and gradient (1 +/- 1 mm Hg). The ICP values showed an immediate decrease (to a mean of 17.0 +/- 8.3 mm Hg), and further decreased overnight (to a mean of 8 +/- 4.2 mm Hg). All patients had subjective and objective improvement, and all but one improved during follow-up (median 23.4 months; range 15.7-31.6 months). Two patients developed stent-adjacent stenosis; retreatment abolished the stenosis and gradient in both cases. Patients presenting with papilledema had resolution on follow-up funduscopic imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT) and improvement on visual field testing. Patients presenting with optic atrophy had optic nerve thinning on follow-up OCT, but improved visual fields.
   CONCLUSIONS For selected patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis with an elevated pressure gradient and elevated ICP, venous sinus stenting results in resolution of the venous pressure gradient, reduction in ICP, and functional, neurological, and ophthalmological improvement. As patients are at risk for stent-adjacent stenosis, further follow-up is necessary to determine long-term outcomes and gain an understanding of venous sinus stenosis as a primary or secondary pathological process behind elevated ICP.

CY OCT 24-25, 2008
CL Tubingen, GERMANY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), or pseudotumour cerebri, is a condition of increased intracranial pressure without space-occupying lesion, cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities or venous sinus thrombosis. This manuscript will discuss three controversies in IIH: (1) its nomenclature; (2) existence without papilloedema; and (3) therapeutic venous stenting. The name pseudotumour cerebri is controversial; idiopathic intracranial hypertension, idiopathic intracranial pressure or primary and secondary intracranial hypertension are preferred terms. Some do not believe the condition exists without papilloedema. Our evaluation found idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilloedema (IIHWOP) in 6% of cases. IIHWOP patients had more diagnostic lumbar punctures and non-physiological visual field constriction; 93% of IIH patients had venous sinus stenosis. Others suggest treating venous sinus narrowing with stenting, which may be viable in rare cases but should not be first-line treatment.

TI Improving vital organs perfusion by the respiratory pump: Physiology and
   clinical use
SO ANNALES FRANCAISES D ANESTHESIE ET DE REANIMATION
AB Objective. - In this article, we review the effects of the respiratory pump to improve vital organ perfusion by the use of an inspiratory threshold device.
   Data sources. - Medline and MeSH database.
   Study selection. - All papers with a level of proof of I to III have been used.
   Data extraction. - The analysis of the papers has focused on the physiological modifications induced by intrathoracic pressure regulation.
   Data synthesis. - Primary function of breathing is to provide gas exchange. Studies of the mechanisms involved in animals and humans provide the physiological underpinnings for "the other side of breathing": to increase circulation to the heart and brain. We describe studies that focus on the fundamental relationship between the generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration through a low-level of resistance created by an impedance threshold device and the physiologic effects of a respiratory pump. A decrease in intrathoracic pressure during inspiration through a fixed resistance resulting in an intrathoracic pressure of -7 cmH(2)O has multiple physiological benefits including: enhanced venous return, cardiac stroke volume and aortic blood pressure; lower intracranial pressure; resetting of the cardiac baroreflex; elevated cerebral blood flow oscillations and increased tissue blood flow/pressure gradient.
   Conclusion. - The clinical and animal studies support the use of the intrathoracic pump to treat different clinical conditions: hemorrhagic shock, orthostatic hypotension, septic shock, and cardiac arrest.

TI The role of venous sinus outflow obstruction in pediatric idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension Clinical article
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB Object. The authors examined the role of venous sinus obstruction in the etiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) by reviewing more than 200 MR venograms performed in suspected cases of IIH.
   Methods. Individual MR venograms performed in cases of suspected IIH at the Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney, Australia, were reviewed. The authors excluded cases in which an intervention was performed before the scan or a structural cause for venous obstruction was identified. Cases with confirmed hydrocephalus were also excluded.
   For each of the 145 remaining scans, the authors completed a detailed review on a slice-by-slice basis of the 2D source images used to compile the rendered 3D MR venogram. The anatomical configuration of the dural venous sinuses and any areas of decreased flow in circulation were then noted. Where possible, they correlated their radiological findings with evidence of raised intracranial pressure based on LP opening pressures. They also reviewed a control group of 50 MR venograms.
   Results. Seventy-six (52%) of 145 scans showed evidence of venous obstruction in the dominant-side circulation. Substantial nonphysiological collateral circulation was seen in 68% of cases with dominant-sided obstruction, suggesting a process of recanalization. In contrast, in the absence of dominant-sided obstruction, collateral circulation was uncommon.
   In 27 cases, CSF opening pressure measurements were available. In 20 cases the opening pressures were in excess of 20 cm H2O. Of those, 17 demonstrated evidence of dominant-sided venous outflow obstruction. Among those cases, the median opening pressure was 34 cm H2O.
   Dominant-sided venous outflow obstruction was seen in only 2 of 50 MR venograms in the control group. Furthermore, evidence of collateral circulation was also uncommon in the control group. There was a highly statistically significant difference between rates of dominant-sided venous obstruction in the suspected ITH and control groups (p <= 0.001).
   Conclusions. A majority of patients presenting for investigation of suspected IIH demonstrated evidence of dominant-sided venous obstruction on MR venogram. In addition there was a high correlation between elevated CSF opening pressures and dominant-sided venous sinus obstruction. This correlation was further supported by evidence of collateral recanalization in patients with elevated CSF pressures and dominant-sided venous obstruction. A control group of 50 MR venograms indicated that dominant-sided venous outflow obstruction is an unlikely incidental finding, and a highly statistically significant difference was found between rates of obstruction in the suspected IIH and control groups.

TI The correlation between intracranial pressure and venous sinus pressures
   changes after venous sinus stenting
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background The pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and other cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVD) has largely been unexplored. While a correlation between venous sinus pressure and opening pressure (OP) has been previously noted, there are limited data on this relationship in patients with prior venous sinus stenting (VSS).Methods A single center retrospective chart review was conducted on CVD patients who underwent diagnostic cerebral venography with manometry followed immediately by lateral decubitus lumbar puncture, from 2016 to 2024.Results 206 patients underwent 216 total procedures and were included. Among all patients, there was a moderate nearly one-to-one correlation between OP and torcular or superior sagittal sinus (SSS) pressures. Thirty-two patients underwent testing after having undergone VSS. Patients with previous VSS showed a significantly altered relationship between venous pressures and OP, whereby as venous sinus pressures increased, OP increased more gradually in previously stented patients compared with non-stented patients. For example, when OP was fixed at 21 mm Hg and body mass index at 30 kg/m2, predicted mean SSS pressure was 19.47 mm Hg in non-stented patients versus 16.91 mm Hg in stented patients.Conclusion This study confirmed a strong relationship between OP and venous sinus pressure in CVD patients. However, patients with previous VSS demonstrated an altered relationship with higher CSF pressures relative to venous pressures compared with na & iuml;ve patients. This finding may have important clinical implications in the management of IIH patients.

TI The Sheep as a Comprehensive Animal Model to Investigate Interdependent
   Physiological Pressure Propagation and Multiparameter Influence on
   Cerebrospinal Fluid Dynamics
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB The present study aims to develop a suitable animal model for evaluating the physiological interactions between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, hemodynamics, and abdominal compartment pressures. We seek to contribute to the enhanced recognition of the pathophysiology of CSF-dependent neurological disorders like hydrocephalus and the improvement of available treatment options. To date, no comprehensive animal model of CSF dynamics exists, and establishing an accurate model will advance our understanding of complex CSF physiology. Persisting knowledge gaps surrounding the communication and pressure propagation between the cerebrospinal space and adjacent anatomical compartments exacerbate the development of novel therapies for neurological diseases. Hence, the need for further investigation of the interactions of vascular, craniospinal, and abdominal pressures remains beyond dispute. Moreover, the results of this animal study support the optimization of in vitro test benches for medical device development, e.g., ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Six female white alpine sheep were surgically equipped with pressure sensors to investigate the physiological values of intracranial, intrathecal, arterial, central venous, jugular venous, vesical pressure, and four differently located abdominal pressures. These values were measured simultaneously during the acute animal trial with sheep under general anesthesia. Both carotid and femoral arterial blood pressure indicate a reliable and comparable representation of the systematic blood pressure. However, the jugular venous pressure and the central venous pressure in sheep in dorsal recumbency do not correlate well under general anesthesia. Furthermore, there is a trend for possible comparability of lateral intraventricular and lumbar intrathecal pressure. Nevertheless, animal body position during measurements must be considered since different body constitutions can alter the horizontal line between the cerebral ventricles and the lumbar subarachnoid space. While intra-abdominal pressure measurement in the four different abdominal quadrants yielded greater inter-individual variability, intra-vesical pressure measurements in our setting delivered comparable values for all sheep. We established a novel and comprehensive ovine animal model to investigate interdependent physiologic pressure propagation and multiparameter influences on CSF dynamics. The results of this study will contribute to further in vitro bench testing, the derivation of novel quantitative models, and the development of a pathologic ovine hydrocephalus model.

TI Treatment of tumor-induced cerebral venous sinus stenosis: Technical
   note and review of the literature
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Introduction Tumors that invade or compress the venous sinuses have the potential to impair venous drainage. Rarely, this may be so severe as to induce intracranial hypertension. Other studies have previously described venous sinus stenting (VSS) for the treatment of these symptomatic lesions. In this report, we present our series of eight cases of VSS for symptomatic tumor-induced venous sinus stenosis and review the existing literature.Cases Eight patients with mostly intracranial tumors were found to have symptomatic venous sinus stenosis with the most common presenting symptom being elevated intracranial pressure. Six of the eight (75%) patients presented with papilledema on neuro-ophthalmological exam. The most affected locations were the transverse and sigmoid sinuses in four patients, followed by the superior sagittal sinus in three patients. All eight patients underwent VSS with no adverse events. In total, 6 out of 8 (75%) of patients had complete resolution of their symptoms, while the remaining patients experienced at least partial improvement.Conclusion Tumors that cause symptomatic venous sinus stenosis may be successfully managed with VSS to improve venous drainage. This may facilitate continued conservative management of meningiomas or allow for treatment with noninvasive means, such as stereotactic radiosurgery. Depending on the size of the target stenosis, balloon-mounted coronary stents may be a suitable option to treat these lesions.

   VENOUS-PRESSURE, INTRA-CRANICAL AND INTRAOCULAR PRESSURES IN PIGS
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB During open-heart surgery, hemodilution is performed before extracorporeal circulation is started by the sampling of autologous blood and substituting an electrolyte solution. Following extracorporeal circulation, first the machine blood and then the autologous blood is reinfused. The hemodilution and reinfusion procedures lead to alterations in blood osmolality and tissue fluid distribution, initiating changes in arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, intracranial and intraocular pressures. These changes were studied in pigs. These potentially hazardous pressure alterations can be minimized through proper handling of the procedure. Some of the mechanisms involved relevant not only in open-heart surgery, but also in the volume therapy of patients in hypovolaemic shock.

TI INVESTIGATION OF THE FREQUENCY OF CEREBRAL TRANSVERSE VENOUS SINUS
   STENOSIS IN IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION
SO JOURNAL OF BASIC AND CLINICAL HEALTH SCIENCES
AB Purpose: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is an increase in intracranial pressure with a normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition that is not due to a secondary cause. The existence of cerebral transverse venous sinus stenosis and changes in venous outflow in IIH has recently gotten a lot of attention, and this situation is becoming increasingly important in terms of diagnosis and treatment plan.
   This study aimed to investigate how frequent cerebral transverse venous sinus stenosis is in patients with IIH.
   Methods: The demographic profile of 27 patients with IIH who were followed up in the hospital's neurological headache outpatient clinic and the occurrence of cerebral transverse venous stenosis on cranial magnetic resonance venography (MRV) were studied. Considering the pre-diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis (SVT), patients who underwent magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and whose SVT was ruled out during their follow-up were included as the control group. This control group consisted of 48 patients diagnosed with migraine, tension-type headache (TTH), and new-onset daily persistent headache.
   Results: When MRVs were investigated, cerebral transverse venous sinus stenosis was detected in %55.6 (n=15) of IIH patients and 25% (n=12) of the control group (p = 0.017).
   Conclusions: The frequency of cerebral transverse sinus stenosis in MRV of patients diagnosed with IIH was found to be significantly higher in this study than in the control group. These findings indicated that cerebral transverse venous stenosis can play a role in the progression of IIH.

TI Pattern of pressure gradient alterations after venous sinus stenting for
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension predicts stent-adjacent stenosis: a
   proposed classification system
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Objective Venous sinus stenting (VSS) is a safe and effective treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with angiographic venous sinus stenosis. However, predictors of stent-adjacent stenosis (SAS) remain poorly defined.
   Methods We performed a retrospective review of 47 patients with IIH and intracranial venous stenosis who underwent VSS with pre- and post-stent venography. Patient characteristics, treatments and outcomes were reviewed. Changes in pressure gradient after VSS were classified according to pattern of gradient resolution into types I-III.
   Results Type I gradient resolution, in which mean venous pressure (MVP) in the transverse sinus (TS) decreases towards MVP in the sigmoid sinus (SS), occurred in 18 patients (38.3%). Type II gradient resolution pattern, in which SS MVP increases towards that in the TS, occurred in 7patients (14.9%). Type III pattern, in which MVP equilibrates to a middle value, occurred in 22patients (46.8%). SAS occurred in 0%, 28.6%, and 22.7% of patients in types I, II and III, respectively. Compared with patients with type I gradient resolution, SAS was more common in those with type II (p=0.0181) and type III (p=0.0306) patterns.
   Conclusions The pattern of change in the trans-stenosis venous pressure gradient may be predictive of SAS and is a useful tool for classifying the response of the venous obstruction to stenting. A type I pattern appears to represent the ideal response to VSS. Some patients with type II and III changes, particularly if they have other predictors of recurrent stenosis, may benefit from longer initial stent constructs.

TI Efficacy of endovascular stenting in dural venous sinus stenosis for the
   treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed for the increased intracranial pressure observed in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The condition is well characterized, with intractable headaches, visual obscurations, and papilledema as dominant features, mainly affecting obese women. With the advent of MR venography and increased use of cerebral angiography, there has been recent emphasis on the significant number of patients with IIH found to have associated nonthrombotic dural venous sinus stenosis. This has led to a renewed interest in endovascular stenting as a treatment for IIH. However, the assumption that venous stenosis leads to a high pressure gradient that decreases CSF resorption through arachnoid villi requires further evidence. In this paper, the authors analyze the published results to date of dural venous sinus stenting in patients with IIH. They also present a case from their institution for illustration. The pathophysiological mechanism in IIH requires further elucidation, but venous sinus stenosis with subsequent intracranial hypertension appears to be an important mechanism in at least a subgroup of patients with IIH. Among these patients, 78% had complete relief or improvement of their main presenting symptoms after endovascular stenting. Resolution or improvement in papilledema was seen in 85.1% of patients. Endovascular stenting should be considered whenever venous sinus stenosis is diagnosed in patients with IIH. (DOI: 10.3171/2009.9.FOCUS09165)

TI CAROTID CAVERNOUS FISTULAS - INDICATIONS FOR URGENT TREATMENT
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY
AB Angiographic and clinical data from 155 patients with carotid cavernous fistulae were retrospectively reviewed to determine angiographic features associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. These features included presence of a pseudoaneurysm, large varix of the cavernous sinus, venous drainage to cortical veins, and thrombosis of venous outflow pathways distant from the fistula. Clinical signs and symptoms that characterized a hazardous carotid cavernous fistula included increased intracranial pressure, rapidly progressive proptosis, diminished visual acuity, hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attacks. Cortical venous drainage from the carotid cavernous fistula is seocndary to occlusion or absence of the normal venous outflow pathways and is associated with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and an increased risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Angiographic demonstration of a cavernous sinus varix, with extension of the sinus into the subarachnoid space, is associated with an increased risk of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Identification of these high-risk features provides a basis for making decisions about treatment.

   ARTERIAL-PRESSURE, CENTRAL VENOUS-PRESSURE AND BRAIN WATER-CONTENT
SO PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR
AB In rabbits who had brain edema and intracranial hypertension induced by a combined cold lesion (over the left hemisphere) and a metabolic blocker (6-aminonicotinamide), the authors analyzed the response of multiple parameters following the administration of 6 mcg/kg/dose of fentanyl every 5 minutes for 1 hour (12 doses), combined with nitrous oxide anesthesia. All animals were mechanically ventilated and the PaCO2 was maintained at 37-43 torr. Gross pathology and extent of Evans Blue extravasation was no different from pretreatment control animals. The systolic arterial pressure and the central venous pressure showed no change during the experiment. The intracranial pressure remained elevated despite fentanyl, but did not increase or decrease throughout the administration of the agent. The brain water content remained unchanged in the right hemisphere, but revealed a significant increase following fentanyl in the cold-lesioned left hemisphere for the gray (p < 0.005) and white matter (p < 0.05).

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension pathogenesis: The jugular
   hypothesis
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB In spite of expanding research, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and its spectrum conditions remain challenging to treat. The failure to develop effective treatment strategies is largely due to poor agreement on a coherent disease pathogenesis model. Herein we provide a hypothesis of a unifying model centered around the internal jugular veins (IJV) to explain the development of IIH, which contends the following: (1) the IJV are prone to both physiological and pathological compression throughout their course, including compression near C1 and the styloid process, dynamic muscular/carotid compression from C3 to C6, and lymphatic compression; (2) severe dynamic IJV stenosis with developments of large cervical gradients is common in IIH-spectrum patients and significantly impacts intracranial venous and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures; (3) pre-existing IJV stenosis may be exacerbated by infectious/inflammatory etiologies that induce retromandibular cervical lymphatic hypertrophy; (4) extra-jugular venous collaterals dilate with chronic use but are insufficient resulting in impaired aggregate cerebral venous outflow; (5) poor IJV outflow initiates, or in conjunction with other factors, contributes to intracranial venous hypertension and congestion leading to higher CSF pressures and intracranial pressure (ICP); (6) glymphatic congestion occurs but is insufficient to compensate and this pathway becomes overwhelmed; and (7) elevated intracranial CSF pressures triggers extramural venous sinus stenosis in susceptible individuals that amplifies ICP elevation producing severe clinical manifestations. Future studies must focus on establishing norms for dynamic cerebral venous outflow and IJV physiology in the absence of disease so that we may better understand and define the diseased state.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Stent or not
SO REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE
AB The pathogenesis and treatment paradigm for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are controversial. Transverse sinus stenosis is seen in the majority of patients with IIH and appears to play a role in the disease process. The debate continues as to whether transverse sinus stenosis is a primary or secondary process relative to raised intracranial pressure. While the role of transverse sinus stenosis in IIH pathogenesis remains controversial, modeling studies suggest that stent placement within a transverse sinus stenosis with a significant pressure gradient should decrease cerebral venous pressure, improve CSF resorption in the venous system, and thereby reduce intracranial (CSF) pressure, improving the symptoms of IIH and reducing papilledema. Beside the classical surgical treatments, venous sinus stenting could be a treatment option for many patients with IIH. However, additional work, preferably controlled prospective studies, needs to be performed to prove its safety and efficacy. The goal of this article is to review the current literature on dural venous sinus stenting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations associated with
   symptomatic congestive intracranial hypertension
SO EUROPEAN NEUROLOGY
AB We report on management strategies and clinical outcomes in 4 cases of acute symptomatic congestive intracranial hypertension associated with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Congestion resulted from high-volume shunts exhausting the drainage capacity of the cerebral venous system in 3 patients, and from sudden venous outflow obstruction in 1 patient. Two AVMs were suggested to be surgically accessible, whereas two AVMs were deemed to be inoperable. Surgically accessible AVMs were treated with embolization followed by complete surgical resection. Inoperable AVMs were treated with partial embolization. Both AVM embolization followed by surgical resection and partial AVM embolization effectively reduced intracranial pressure and achieved sustained patient recovery. Hence, an endovascular approach may be considered to manage AVM-related congestive intracranial hypertension either in combination with surgical AVM removal, or as a palliative approach in inoperable AVMs. Copyright (C) 2007 S.

SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB We report a patient with intracranial hemorrhage secondary to venous hypertension as a result of a giant aortic pseudoaneurysm that compressed the superior vena cava and caused obstruction of the venous return from the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first patient reported to have an intracranial hemorrhage secondary to a superior vena cava syndrome. The condition appears to be caused by a reversible transient rise in intracranial pressure, as a result of compression of the venous return from the brain. Treatment consisted of surgery for the aortic pseudoaneurysm, which led to normalization of the intracranial pressure and resorption of the intracranial hemorrhage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: Contemporary Management and
   Endovascular Techniques
SO SEMINARS IN INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease process of abnormally increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion. Medical management, optic nerve fenestration, and surgical shunting procedures have failed to produce consistently successful results. In an unknown percentage of cases, IIH is caused by dural venous sinus obstruction which can be cured by endovascular treatment with dural venous sinus stent placement. This helps prevent progressive vision loss and worsening papilledema caused by underlying increased intracranial pressure from venous outflow obstruction. Patients are required to have an established diagnosis of IIH, preferably made by a neuroophthalmologist, with clearly documented papilledema or at minimum visual disturbance along with lumbar puncture opening pressure greater than 25 cm H (2) O. Transverse to sigmoid sinus focal narrowing (intraluminal filling defect or extrinsic compression) must be seen during the venous phase of neuroangiography (NA) along with a pressure gradient of 10 mm Hg or greater across the focal narrowing during dural venous sinus pressure monitoring. A successful reduction is defined as a pressure gradient of less than 10 mm Hg after stent placement. Neuroophthalmologic follow-up occurs within 1 to 2 months to assess for changes in papilledema. If papilledema is unchanged or worsened, NA and hemodynamic evaluation is repeated for consideration of restenting. Appropriate patient selection criteria are required for IIH venous sinus stenting. The utilization of refined endovascular techniques along with postprocedure follow-up protocols can ultimately cure IIH for a select group of patients.

SP Asian Oceanian Soc Neuroradiol & Head & Neck Radiol
AB Object. Findings in animal models of noncommunicating hydrocephalus have suggested that a reduction in compliance of the superior sagittal sinus, an elevation in venous outflow pressure, and the development of venous collateral flow may be associated with this condition. Although elevated venous pressure is known to cause hydrocephalus in children, this mechanism has fallen out of favor as a theory in adults.
   Methods. Twenty-one patients with late-onset idiopathic aqueductal stenosis (LIAS) underwent magnetic resonance imaging with flow quantification measuring the degree of ventricular enlargement, sulcal compression, total blood inflow, superior sagittal/straight sinus outflow, aqueduct flow, arteriovenous delay (AVD), and the extent of collateral venous flow. Data obtained in these patients were compared with those obtained in 21 age-matched control individuals.
   Results. There was a reduction in compliance in the patients with LIAS in whom the AVD decreased by 50% (p = 0.01). The arterial inflow and the straight sinus outflow were normal, but the sagittal sinus outflow was reduced by 23% (p = 0.001). This indicated that significant collateral venous outflow pathways were draining blood away from the superficial but not the deep drainage system.
   Conclusions. Similar to the animal models, patients with LIAS exhibit a reduced venous compliance and an elevation in venous collateral flow. Together, these findings suggest that an elevation in venous pressure may be associated with this disease process. A review of the literature has indicated that only subtle differences may exist in the pathophysiology among patients with LIAS, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

SO HANDBOOK OF CARDIAC ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND DEVICES, SECOND EDITION
AB Novel noninvasive technologies that harness the inherent physiological interactions between the heart, lungs, and brain have recently been shown to improve circulation and Outcomes after cardiac arrest and other states of low blood pressure including hypovolemic shock. The impedance threshold devices (ResQPOD (R) and ResQGard (R)) and the intrathoracic pressure regulator (CirQlator (TM)) are three new devices that create a negative intrathoracic pressure. The decrease in intrathoracic pressure creates a vacuum within the thorax relative to the rest of the body thereby enhancing venous blood return to the heart, increasing cardiac output and systemic arterial blood pressure, lowering right atrial and pulmonary artery pressures, lowering intracranial pressure. and increasing cerebral perfusion pressure. The animal and clinical data supporting the use of technologies that harness the intrathoraic pump are reviewed in this chapter.

TI Pseudotumor cerebri
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Pseudotumor cerebri is a condition characterized by raised intracranial pressure, normal CSF contents, and normal brain with normal or small ventricles on imaging studies. It affects predominantly obese women of childbearing age; however, its incidence seems to be increasing among adolescent and children. While among older children the clinical picture is similar to that of adults, younger children present demographic and clinical peculiarities. Different diagnostic criteria for adults and pre-pubertal children have been proposed. Etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear, particular concerning the role of obstruction to venous outflow.
   An extensive literature review concerning all the aspects of pseudotumor cerebri has been performed, both among adults and pre-pubertal children.
   Pseudotumor cerebri is an avoidable cause of visual loss, both in adults and children. Few diagnostic measures are usually sufficient to determine the correct diagnosis. Since pseudotumor cerebri is a diagnosis of exclusion, the differential diagnosis work out is of special importance. Modern neuroimaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography may clarify the role of obstruction to venous outflow in each case. Various therapeutic options are available: medical, surgical, and endovascular procedures may be used to prevent irreversible visual loss. Treatment is usually effective, and most patients will experience complete resolution of symptoms without persistent deficits.

TI Headache, Cerebrospinal Fluid Leaks, and Pseudomeningoceles after
   Resection of Vestibular Schwannomas: Efficacy of Venous Sinus Stenting
   Suggests Cranial Venous Outflow Compromise as a Unifying
   Pathophysiological Mechanism
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY PART B-SKULL BASE
AB Background Regardless of the operative approach, headache, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, and pseudomeningoceles remain disproportionately common problems after surgery for vestibular schwannomas and have a significant negative impact on quality of life and potential to return to full employment. Recent work has raised the possibility that these problems may, in part, be related to acquired obstruction of cranial venous outflow. This article explores this idea further with respect to a group of patients with severe and intractable symptoms. Objective The main objective of this article is to describe our experience diagnosing, investigating, and treating cranial venous outflow obstruction following translabyrinthine resection of vestibular schwannomas. Methods Retrospective review of all patients ( n = 9) at our institution referred for sigmoid sinus stenting following translabyrinthine surgery. Results Headache resolved or improved after sigmoid stenting in all five patients in whom it was the primary symptom. CSF leak was the primary problem in two patients. In one, the leak was unchanged, but headache improved. In the other, the leak resolved, and headache improved. Two patients had symptomatic pseudomeningoceles and both resolved Conclusion Assuming a meticulous approach to wound closure, a CSF leak following surgery for vestibular schwannoma can be viewed as a pathological, but essentially homeostatic, response to raised intracranial pressure caused by acquired obstruction to cranial venous outflow. Postoperative headache (from high or low intracranial pressure) and CSF leaks, therefore, may all respond to measures aimed at eliminating the obstructing lesion.

TI Divergence of intracranial and central venous pressures in lightly
   anesthetized, tracheally intubated dogs that move in response to a
   noxious stimulus
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Background: lntracranial pressure (ICP) may increase in tracheally intubated subjects during periods of movement (e.g., ''bucking'' and coughing). Recent research has suggested that factors other than passive congestion of the cerebral vessels, resulting from increases in central venous pressure, may contribute to the ICP response. The current study evaluated this issue in a canine model of intracranial hypertension and additionally evaluated the relationship between ICP and static increases in superior vena caval pressure.
   Methods: Six dogs were lightly anesthetized with 0.65% end-expired halothane In oxygen and nitrogen, and ventilation was mechanically controlled. Intracranial pressure was increased to a stable baseline of 15-20 mmHg using a subarachnoid infusion of warm 0.9% saline solution. The following variables were quantified before, and for 6 min after, initiating a 1-min noxious stimulus to the trachea and skin: ICP, central venous pressure, electromyograms (masseter, deltoid, and intercostal muscles), intrathoracic pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure (defined as mean arterial pressure - ICP). Later, the protocol was repeated in the presence of neuromuscular block with pancuronium. Finally, in the same dogs, occlusion of the superior vena cava at its junction with the tight atrium was used to increase superior vena caval pressure in 5-mmHg increments, from 5 to 30 mmHg, so that the resulting increases in ICP could be quantified.
   Results: In unparalyzed dogs whose heads were maintained at the level of the right atrium, there was a 22-mmHg increase in ICP at 1 min after initiating the noxious stimulus (P < 0.05). The ICP increase was related to electromyogram activation and a 6-mmHg increase in central venous pressure; however, it was not associated with significant increases in intrathoracic pressure or cerebral perfusion pressure. Treatment with pancuronium abolished the electromyographic, ICP, and central venous pressure responses to noxious stimulus. When superior vena caval pressure was statically manipulated, the resulting ICP increase was only one half the magnitude of the superior vena caval pressure increase. After elevating the head 14 cm, the ratio of ICP to superior vena caval pressure increases was reduced to one third.
   Conclusions: If these results apply to humans, it was concluded that increases in ICP that accompany movement in tracheally intubated patients may arise from two complementary factors: (1) cerebrovascular dilation that correlates with electromyographic activity and is mediated by ascending neural pathways that transmit proprioreceptive information, and (2) passive venous congestion that results from any increase in central venous pressure. The influence of the latter factor can be reduced by elevating the head.

TI Update on Pseudotumor cerebri (Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension)
SO AKTUELLE NEUROLOGIE
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by an increase of intracranial pressure of unknown etiology. The clinical presentation is dominated by progressive visual disturbances, which are commonly the result of a papilledema, headache and cranial nerve palsies. Clinical studies have revealed over the past years that the syndrome may also be associated with olfactory disturbances, cognitive deficits and a pulsatile tinnitus. The underlying pathomechanism is probably based on a disturbance of venous outflow which causes a reduced absorption of cerebrospinal fluid that results in an increase of cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It remains unclear if the venous outflow disturbance results from overweight-induced increase of intrathoracic pressure, the presence of sinus vein stenoses or both conditions. Recently hormonal factors have also been discussed but the mechanisms behind a potential influence on intracranial pressure remain unclear. Treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension relies mainly on an effective body weight reduction and a medication with carboanhydrase inhibitors which can reduce the production of cerebrospinal fluid and body weight. Results of the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial as well as a 12-month follow-up show that acetazolamide effectively reduces papilledema, visual disturbances and headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. In contrast, the evidence for the carboanhydrase inhibitors topiramate and furosemide still relies on open-label studies as double-blind, placebo-controlled trials for their efficacy in idiopathic intracranial hypertension do not exist. In addition to the treatment with carboanhydrase inhibitors, increasing evidence suggests that the somatostatinanalogon octreotide may be effective in the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension but up to date no randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial exists to confirm this observation.

TI Sinus venous stenosis-associated IIHWOP is a powerful risk factor for
   progression and refractoriness of pain in primary headache patients: a
   review of supporting evidences
SO NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Reported prevalence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema (IIHWOP) in series of patients with chronic or transformed migraine is significantly higher than expected; yet, IIHWOP is not included among the risk factors for migraine progression. However, several studies provided evidences suggesting that IIHWOP could represent a possible, largely underestimated, risk factor for progression of pain in migraine and, possibly, in other primary headaches. Data from two recent studies, albeit aimed to different end-points, strongly support this hypothesis. In the first study, conducted on a large series of neurological patients without any sign or symptom of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), including chronic headache, the prevalence of bilateral central venous stenosis at magnetic resonance venography (MRV) was 23% and an IIHWOP at opening pressure was found in 48% of this subgroup (11% of the whole sample) while it was not detected in any of the subjects with normal MRV. This indicates that IIHWOP may be much more prevalent than believed in general population and that it can run without any symptom or sign of raised ICP in most of affected subjects. In the second paper, sinus venous stenosis-associated IIHWOP has been found in about one half of a large chronic primary headache patients series with poor response to treatments and in none of those with normal MRV. Moreover, after the diagnostic lumbar puncture, a transient improvement of headache frequency has been observed in the majority of intracranial hypertensive chronic headache subjects. Taken together, the data of these two recent papers rise the following hypothesis: (1) asymptomatic IIHWOP is much more prevalent than expected in general population; (2) IIHWOP is a powerful and largely unrecognized risk factor for progression of pain in primary headache patients; (3) sinus venous stenosis at MRV is a reliable predictor of raised intracranial hypertension also in asymptomatic patients; (4) sinus venous stenosis has a causative role in IIH pathophysiology. These assumptions share a potential high clinical impact and need to be urgently tested in adequately designed controlled studies.

TI Life changing response to successive surgical interventions on cranial
   venous outflow: A case report on chronic fatigue syndrome
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Recognition of similarities between chronic fatigue syndrome and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has raised suggestions that they might be connected, with chronic fatigue syndrome representing a mild version of IIH, sharing many of its symptoms, but without the signature features of elevated intracranial pressure that characterize the complete syndrome. A further development of this idea factors in the effects of a cerebrospinal fluid leak, a known complication of IIH, to explain cases where symptoms seem out of proportion to the apparent physiological disturbance. Cranial venous outflow obstruction has been proposed as the pathological substrate. We describe a patient with multiple symptoms, including headache and disabling fatigue, in which this model guided investigation and treatment. Specifically, CT and catheter venography identified focal narrowings of both jugular and the left brachiocephalic veins. Treatment of brachiocephalic obstruction was not feasible. However, in separate surgical procedures, relief of jugular venous obstruction produced incremental and significant clinical improvements which have proven durable over the length of follow-up. We suggest that investigating chronic fatigue syndrome under this model might not only bring benefit to individual patients but also will provide new insights into IIH and its relationship with spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

TI Treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension by endovascular
   improvement of venous drainage of the brain
SO OPHTHALMOLOGE
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of any known causative factor. Most patients with IIH respond to weight reduction, repeated lumbar punctures and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide and topiramate to reduce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production. Despite a number of pathogenetic theories, the cause of IIH remains unknown. With the availability of magnetic resonance (MR) venography and cerebral angiography, venous disease is increasingly being discussed as the etiology of IIH, with a high proportion of patients presenting with nonthrombotic unilateral or bilateral dural venous sinus stenoses. Based on this observation, endovascular stenting of stenotic dural sinuses in patients with IIH has gained popularity. Whether dural venous sinus stenoses are the cause or the consequence of increased ICP is still under debate. In patients with failure of conservative treatment or non-compliance, a more aggressive treatment, such as CSF shunting or surgical optic nerve fenestration, should be performed. For approximately 13 years endovascular stenting of the stenotic sinuses has been used and discussed as an alternative and effective treatment of IIH. Since the first report in 2002, individual cases and case series have been published demonstrating that stents immediately lower the venous pressure gradient, which is associated with clinical improvement. This effect occurs within days or weeks and is permanent in many cases.

TI Stenosis Before Thrombosis: Intracranial Hypertension from Jugular
   Foramen Stenosis Secondary to Renal Osteodystrophy
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Venous outflow obstructions are rare anatomic findings that can appear with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure, including headache and vision loss, and can be mistaken for more common diagnoses, such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Although venous outflow obstructions have been reported in rare bone dysplasias and congenital abnormalities, to date they have not been reported in renal osteodystrophy (ROD), a relatively common disorder seen in patients with chronic kidney disease.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this case, the authors describe a patient with marked intracranial hypertension from jugular foramen stenosis secondary to ROD. After diagnosis by CT and magnetic resonance venography, catheter venography confirmed an osseus band around the left jugular bulb, and a 40-mm Hg pressure gradient across the stenotic foramen. The patient subsequently underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting and optic nerve sheath fenestration with symptom improvement. The postoperative course was significant for development of CVST, necessitating treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report reviews the presentation, pathology, and neurosurgical treatment of patients with ROD and venous outflow obstructions, and explores the differential diagnoses of outflow obstructions, IIH, and CVST. To our knowledge, this is the first report of intracranial hypertension from jugular foramen stenosis secondary to renal osteodystrophy.

TI Saving the brain after mild-to-moderate traumatic injury: A report on
   new insights of the physiology underlying adequate maintenance of
   cerebral perfusion
SO JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB Supplemental digital content is available in the text.
   ABSTRACTTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in civilian trauma and battlefield settings. It has been classified across a continuum of dysfunctions, with as much as 80% to 90% of cases diagnosed as mild to moderate in combat casualties. In this report, a framework is presented that focuses on the potential benefits for acute noninvasive treatment of reduced cerebral perfusion associated with mild TBI by harnessing the natural transfer of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration. This process is known as intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) therapy, which can be applied by having a patient breath against a small inspiratory resistance created by an impedance threshold device. Intrathoracic pressure regulation therapy leverages two fundamental principles for improving blood flow to the brain: (1) greater negative intrathoracic pressure enhances venous return, cardiac output, and arterial blood pressure; and (2) lowering of intracranial pressure provides less resistance to cerebral blood flow. These two effects work together to produce a greater pressure gradient that results in an improvement in cerebral perfusion pressure. In this way, IPR therapy has the potential to counter hypotension and hypoxia, potentially significant contributing factors to secondary brain injury, particularly in conditions of multiple injuries that include severe hemorrhage. By implementing IPR therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate TBI, a potential exists to provide early neuroprotection at the point of injury and a bridge to more definitive care, particularly in settings of prolonged delays in evacuation such as those anticipated in future multidomain operations.LEVEL OF EVIDENCEReport.

TI Venous Sinus Stenting for Low Pressure Gradient Stenoses in Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is frequently treated with venous sinus stenosis stenting with high success rates. Patient selection has been driven almost exclusively by identification of supraphysiological venous pressure gradients across stenotic regions based on theoretical assessment of likelihood of response.
   OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility of benefit in low venous pressure gradient patients.
   METHODS: Using a single-center, prospectively maintained registry of patients with IIH undergoing venous stenting, we defined treatment groups by gradient pressures of <= 4, 5 to 8, and >8 mmHg based on the most frequently previously published thresholds for stenting. Baseline demographics, clinical, and neuro-ophthalmological outcomes (including optical coherence tomography and Humphrey visual fields) were compared.
   RESULTS: Among 53 patients, the mean age was 32 years and 70% female with a mean body mass index was 36 kg/m(2). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The mean change in lumbar puncture opening pressure at 6 months poststenting was similar between the 3 groups (<= 4, 5-8, and >8 mmHg; 13.4, 12.9, and 12.4 cmH(2)O, P = .47). Papilledema improvement was observed across groups at 6 months (100, 93, and 86, P = .7) as were all clinical symptoms. The mean changes in optical coherence tomography retinal nerve fiber layer (-30, -54, and -104, P = .5) and mean deviation in Humphrey visual fields (60, 64, and 67, P = .5) at 6 weeks were not significantly different.
   CONCLUSION: Patients with IH with low venous pressure gradient venous sinus stenosis seem to benefit equally from venous stenting compared with their higher gradient counterparts. Re-evaluation of our restrictive criteria for this potentially vision sparing intervention is warranted. Future prospective confirmatory studies are needed.

TI Monitoring intracranial pressure. Indication, limits, practice
SO ANAESTHESIST
AB The function of the brain is not checkable in comatose or sedated patients. Because secondary brain damage will often cause brain edema it is necessary to recognize the resulting increases in brain pressure. Therefore, measurement of intracranial brain pressure (ICP) is the standard monitoring procedure in neurological intensive care. The procedure with a small drill hole trepanation and the insertion of a micropressure sensor has a comparatively low complication rate and offers continuous monitoring with reliable values. Other neuro-monitoring procedures have not achieved the value of ICP measurement and only reflect changes in ICP with other measurement principles. ICP measurement is the procedure which is decisive for conservative measures in the intensive care unit to secure cerebral perfusion or indications for surgical treatment of brain edema. Central venous pressure, intra-abdominal pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure do not have a substantial influence on ICP.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DISEASES OF CHILDREN
AB Objective.-To determine whether conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation causes retinal hemorrhages in piglets.
   Design.-Nonrandomized observations.
   Setting.-Animal physiology laboratory.
   Participants.-Six 3.5- to 4.5-kg piglets.
   Interventions.-Fifty minutes of conventional, closed chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Measurements/Main Results.-Intrathoracic venous pressure (right atrium) and intracranial venous pressure (sagittal sinus) were directly measured. At 5 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the mean (+/-SEM) sagittal sinus pressure was 41 +/- 8 mm Hg and the mean right atrial pressure was 58+/-9 mm Hg. The pressures were sustained throughout the 50 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. At autopsy, there was no gross or microscopic evidence of retinal hemorrhages.
   Conclusion.-These results support the conclusion that cardiopulmonary resuscitation does not cause retinal hemorrhages.

TI NEUROOPHTHALMIC FEATURES OF CEREBRAL VENOUS OBSTRUCTION
SO ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY
AB Objective: To characterize the neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of impaired cranial venous outflow.
   Design: A retrospective study of 20 patients who developed increased intracranial pressure as the result of impaired cerebral drainage.
   Setting: Three neuro-ophthalmologic referral centers.
   Patients: Ten patients had noncompressive thrombosis of sagittal or lateral sinuses (noncompressive group), four had compression of the sagittal sinus or jugular veins (compressive group), and six had transient sinus thrombosis following surgical procedures (iatrogenic group).
   Interventions: Medical and/or surgical treatment of increased intracranial pressure and of underlying conditions predisposing to venous obstruction.
   Main Outcome Measures: Symptoms (headache and esodeviation) and signs (visual acuity, visual fields, and optic disc appearance) of increased intracranial pressure.
   Results: Headache was more severe, esodeviation was more prevalent, and onset was more abrupt in the noncompressive group than in the compressive and iatrogenic groups. Among the 10 patients with noncompressive thrombosis, factors predisposing to thrombosis were present in seven patients but sometimes overlooked. Following treatment, visual outcome was generally favorable in all three groups. All patients had 20/30 or better visual acuity in at least one eye, and substantial visual field loss was present in both eyes of only two patients.
   Conclusions: The clinical manifestation of impaired cerebral venous outflow vary depending on the underlying mechanism. Although most patients maintain good vision, more aggressive treatment is sometimes indicated in patients with thrombosis or compression. The abrupt onset and marked severity of symptoms in patients with thrombosis should help to differentiate these patients from those with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

TI Transverse Sinus Stenting for the Treatment of Idiopathic Intracranial
   Hypertension With a Pressure Gradient of 70 mm Hg: A Technical Note and
   Systematic Review
SO OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE:Venous sinus stenosis is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Venous stenting has emerged as a promising treatment option for patients with IIH because of venous sinus stenosis refractory to medical management or unsuitable for shunt placement. In this technical note, we present a case of IIH with the highest recorded pressure gradient to date.CLINICAL PRESENTATION:This technical note presents the successful use of intracranial venous stenting in a patient with IIH because of severe venous sinus stenosis, leading to significant improvement in vision and reduction in intracranial pressure. A meticulous review of the literature revealed that our patient exhibited the highest recorded pressure gradient (70 mm Hg). This remarkable finding underscores the potential effectiveness of venous stenting as a viable treatment approach. The procedure involved the placement of a Zilver stent (Cook Medical) and balloon angioplasty after stenting of the right transverse sinus stenosis, resulting in a substantial decrease in pressure gradient. Following the procedure, another venous manometry showed no more gradient with a uniform pressure in the whole venous system at 18 mm Hg.CONCLUSION:To our knowledge, this case presents the highest pressure gradient reported in the literature and contributes to the growing evidence supporting venous stenting in patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis.

However, the association between BMI and the efficacy of VSS remains poorly characterized.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine, in a retrospective cohort study, the effect of BMI on preoperative mean intracranial venous pressure (MVP) and post-VSS outcomes.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively collected database of patients with IIH and intracranial venous sinus stenosis who underwent VSS. Patient demographics and treatment factors, including pre- and postprocedural trans-stenosis pressure gradients, were analyzed to identify the relationship between BMI and outcomes after VSS.
   RESULTS: Increasing BMI was significantly correlated with higher maximum MVP (P = .013) and higher trans-stenosis pressure gradient (P = .043) prior to treatment. The degrees of improvement in maximum MVP and pressure gradient after VSS were greatest for obese and morbidly obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)). Maximum poststent MVP, clinical outcomes, and stent-adjacent stenosis requiring retreatment after VSS were not significantly associated with BMI.
   CONCLUSION: We provide direct evidence for a positive correlation between BMI and intracranial venous pressure in patients with IIH. VSS affords a significantly greater amelioration of intracranial venous hypertension and stenosis for IIH patients with higher BMIs. As such, obesity should not be a deterrent for the use of VSS in the management of IIH.

TI EFFECTS OF MEDETOMIDINE ADMINISTRATION ON INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE AND
   CARDIOVASCULAR VARIABLES OF ISOFLURANE-ANESTHETIZED DOGS
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Intracranial pressure and cardiovascular variables after nr administration of medetomidine (0.03 mg/kg of body weight) were evaluated in 6 healthy, mixed-breed dogs anesthetized with 1.3% end-tidal isoflurane concentration and mechanically ventilated to normocapnia (Pa-co2, 35 to 45 mm of Hg). Baseline values were determined for intracranial pressure, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, end-tidal CO2 tension and isoflurane concentration, arterial pH and CO2 and O-2 tensions, and core body temperature. Cerebral perfusion pressure, cardiac index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, plasma HCO3- concentration, and base excess were calculated. Intracranial pressure was measured, using a calibrated, fiberoptic transducer placed within the brain parenchyma and secured to the calvarium by means of a subarachnoid bolt. Cardiac output was determined by thermodilution. End-tidal CO2 tension and isoflurane concentration were determined, using an infrared gas analyzer. Administration of medetomidine did not change intracranial pressure, but was associated with significant (P < 0.05) decreases in values for heart rate, cardiac index, end-tidal CO2, and HCO3- and with significant increases in systolic, mean, and diastolic pressure; pulmonary artery pressure; systemic vascular resistance; central venous pressure; and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

TI Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Masking as Obstructive
   Hydrocephalus: A Case Report
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a poorly understood phenomenon and its presentation can both mimic and co-exist with other intra-cranial processes. Accurate diagnosis is imperative as ongoing advancements in treatment can yield dramatic positive results. Here we present the case of an individual with signs and symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus who was ultimately found to have IIH secondary to venous sinus stenosis. After correction of the venous sinus stenosis, resolution in the patient's symptoms was noted. The case highlights some of the unique considerations in approaching patients with IIH and provides a framework for review of current literature related to IIH and venous sinus stenosis.

TI Meningioma of the pineal region: A surgical series of 10 cases
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Ten cases of meningioma of the pineal region were histologically verified at a single institution during an 8-year period. These represented 0.3% of 3061 intracranial meningiomas, as well as 6.2% of 164 pineal tumors. patients were predominantly women. Symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure were most common, whereas Parinaud's syndrome was observed in only one case. Computerized tomography (CT) was the main diagnostic test used in the present series. It usually revealed a hyperdense mass with high-intensity contrast enhancement and a calcified mass eccentrically located at the periphery, which returned to its central location postsurgically and was likely to represent a calcified pineal gland. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in the more recent cases and confirmed the suspicion raised by CT of a meningioma with a calcified mass at its periphery. Surgery was performed using an occipital transtentorial microsurgical approach with the patient placed in the semisitting position. Gross-total tumor removal was achieved in all cases, although this required sacrifice of the vein of Galen in six patients. Venous occlusion was performed only after adequate intraoperative verification of functional occlusion and blood flow diversion from the galenic system and had no consequences in any case but one. This latter patient had an infiltrative meningioma that was removed at the expense of intraoperative sacrifice of the two internal cerebral veins, as well as unavoidable trauma to the region of the quadrigeminal plate. All the remaining patients improved postsurgery, and only one had a permanent visual field deficit as a result of the surgical approach. Pineal meningiomas represent a rare subgroup of pineal tumors that can be treated surgically with reasonably good results. Sacrifice of major basal veins may be required to achieve radical tumor removal and can he tolerated by the patient provided that functional occlusion of the galenic system, as indicated by preoperative angiography, is verified during surgery.

TI Neurologic and ophthalmologic complications of vascular access in a
   hemodialysis patient
SO PEDIATRIC NEPHROLOGY
AB Patients on long-term hemodialysis undergo multiple interventions, including insertion of central catheters and arteriovenous anastomoses for creation of vascular access. The need for high-flow vessels to maintain hemodialysis efficiency leads to wear on the central veins and consequent stenosis and occlusion. In addition to local signs of impaired venous drainage, abnormal venous flow patterns involving the upper chest, face, and central nervous system might develop. We describe the first pediatric case of devastating intracranial hypertension presenting with visual loss in the eye contralateral to a high-flow vascular access in a patient on long-term hemodialysis. The literature on this rare complication of hemodialysis is reviewed.

TI TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, HEMORRHAGIC-SHOCK, AND FLUID RESUSCITATION -
   EFFECTS ON INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE AND BRAIN COMPLIANCE
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Hemorrhagic hypovolemia commonly coexists with head injury in this population of patients. Therapy directed at correcting hypovolemic shock includes vigorous volume expansion with crystalloid' solutions. It is hypothesized that, following traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular dysfunction results in rapid loss of brain compliance, resulting in increased sensitivity to cerebrovascular venous pressure. Increased central venous pressure (CVP) occurring with vigorous crystalloid resuscitation may therefore contribute to the loss of brain compliance and the development of intracranial hypertension.
   The authors tested this hypothesis in miniature swine subjected to traumatic brain injury, hemorrhage, and resuscitation. Elevated CVP following resuscitation from hemorrhage to a high CVP significantly worsened intracranial hypertension in animals with concurrent traumatic brain injury, as compared to animals subjected to traumatic brain injury alone (mean +/- standard error of the mean: 33.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 20.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, p < 0.05) or to animals subjected to the combination of traumatic brain injury, hemorrhage, and resuscitation to a low CVP (33.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 24.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, p < 0.05). These data support the hypothesis that reduction in brain compliance can occur secondary to elevation of CVP following resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock. This may worsen intracranial hypertension in patients with traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic shock.

TI Venous sinus stenting improves cerebral autoregulation in a patient with
   venous sinus stenosis: a case report
SO BMC NEUROLOGY
AB Background Venous sinus stenosis (VSS) is a type of cerebral venous vascular disease. Cerebral autoregulation is an indicator of cerebral arterial function. The cerebral circulatory system is composed of the venous system and arterial system. Impaired venous function may affect arterial function. Thus, cerebral venous stenosis may influence cerebral autoregulation. Case presentation In this case, a 50-year-old woman with transient blindness and headache was admitted to the hospital. The patient was diagnosed with VSS. A stent was placed at the stenosis. The stent released the intravenous pressure and remitted the patient's symptoms. Measurements of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) were performed at 3 time points: before stenting, after stenting, and 3 months later. The dCA gradually improved after stenting. Conclusion VSS may have an influence on cerebral autoregulation, and effective treatment improves cerebral autoregulation in patients with VSS.

AB Objective: To study the effects of elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) upon intracranial (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) before and after intravascular volume resuscitation.
   Materials and Methods: Intra-abdominal pressure was increased in five anesthetized swine by inflating an intraperitoneal balloon until the IAP was 25 mm Hg above baseline, Intravascular volume was then expanded and finally abdominal decompression was performed. Changes in ICP and systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic parameters secondary to increasing IAP were measured, The effect upon CPP was derived from these measurements. PaO2 and PaCO2 were maintained relatively constant by increasing ventilatory rate.
   Measurements and Main Results: Elevated IAP significantly increased ICP (7.6 +/- 1.2 vs, 21.4 +/- 1.0), pleural pressure and central venous pressure; whereas cardiac index and CPP (82.2 +/- 6.3 vs, 62.0 +/- 10.0) decreased significantly, Intravascular volume expansion further significantly increased ICP (27.8 +/- 1.0), and significantly increased both mean arterial pressure (83.4 +/- 14.0 versus 103.4 +/- 8.9) and CPP (75.6 +/- 9.0). Abdominal decompression returned ICP (11.2 +/- 1.8) toward baseline and further increased CPP (79.8 +/- 9.7).
   Conclusions: Elevated IAP increases ICP and decreases CPP and cardiac index, Volume expansion further increases ICP yet improves CPP via its greater positive effect upon mean arterial pressure (*p < analysis of variance, All measurements are mean +/- SEM in mm Hg).

TI Venous Sinus Stenting in the Management of Patients with Intracranial
   Hypertension Manifesting with Skull Base Cerebrospinal Fluid Leaks
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with skull base cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are found to have elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). In these patients, elevated ICP is thought to contribute to both the pathophysiology of the leak and postoperative leak recurrences. Current strategies for postoperative ICP control include medical therapy and shunting procedures. The aim of this study is to report the use of venous sinus stenting (VSS) in the management of patients with skull base CSF leaks caused by elevated ICP.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective investigation of 2 patients who underwent surgical repair of skull base CSF leaks and were found to have elevated ICP associated with venous sinus stenosis and subsequently treated with VSS.
   RESULTS: Two patients underwent successful surgical repair of skull base CSF leaks with perioperative ICP monitoring via temporary lumbar catheters. Postoperative CSF pressure measurement demonstrated elevated ICP. Both patients were found to have venous sinus stenosis on further workup and subsequently underwent VSS for treatment of intracranial hypertension. Both patients had improvement in their symptoms with no evidence of recurrent CSF leak at follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with skull base CSF leaks of unknown etiology should undergo CSF pressure monitoring postoperatively and, if found to be elevated, be treated for intracranial hypertension. In patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, medical therapy, VSS can provide an alternative option to medical and surgical shunting procedures for treatment of intracranial hypertension in patients with skull base CSF leaks and venous sinus stenosis.

TI 3D digital subtracted angiography venous roadmapping for endovascular
   management of dural venous stenosis
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Stenting of the dural venous sinuses has emerged as a therapeutic option for intracranial hypertension and pulsatile tinnitus. However, venous endovascular navigation faces challenges due to lower-quality roadmaps compared to arterial navigation. This study explores the application of three-dimensional (3D) rotational venography in assessing the cerebral venous vasculature and its potential for venous navigation. The methods involve venous 3D digital subtracted angiography (DSA) in patients with dural venous stenosis, with image acquisition using a biplane angiographic system. The results highlight the enhanced spatial resolution of 3D venous imaging, providing anatomical information crucial for precise characterization of stenosis and understanding cortical venous drainage. 3D venous roadmapping is shown to improve endovascular venous navigation, offering synchronized and rotatable 3D roadmaps, providing a comprehensive approach to optimize endovascular venous interventions.

TI Effects of incomplete chest wall decompression during cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation on coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures in a porcine
   model of cardiac arrest
SO RESUSCITATION
AB Introduction: Recent data suggest that generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during the decompression phase of CPR improves hemodynamics, organ perfusion and survival.
   Hypothesis: Incomplete chest wall recoil during the decompression phase of standard CPR increases intrathoracic pressure and right atrial pressure, impedes venous return, decreases compression-induced aortic pressures and results in a decrease of mean arterial pressure, coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure.
   Methods: Nine pigs in ventricular fibrillation (VF) for 6 min, were treated with an automated compression/decompression device with a compression rate of 100 min(-1), a depth of 25% of the anterior-posterior diameter, and a compression to ventilation ratio of 15:2 with 100% decompression (standard CPR) for 3 min. Compression was then reduced to 75% of complete decompression for I min of CPR and then restored for another 1 min of CPR to 100% full decompression. Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated as the diastolic (aortic (Ao)-right atrial (RA) pressure). Cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP) was calculated multiple ways: (1) the positive area (in mmHg s) between aortic pressure and intracranial pressure (ICP) waveforms, (2) the coincident difference in systolic and diastolic aortic and intracranial pressures (mmHg), and (3) CerPP = MAP - ICP. ANOVA was used for statistical analysis and all values were expressed as mean S.E.M. The power of the study for an alpha level of significance set at 0.05 was > 0.90.
   Results: With CPR performed with 100%-75%-100% of complete chest wall recoil, respectively, the CPP was 23.3 +/- 1.9, 15.1 +/- 1.6, 16.6 +/- 1.9, p = 0.003; CerPP was: (1) area: 313.8 +/- 104, 89.2 +/- 39, 170.5 +/- 42.9, p = 0.03, (2) systolic aortic minus intracranial pressure difference: 22.8 +/- 3.6, 16.5 +/- 4, 23.7 +/- 4.5, p = n.s., and diastolic pressure difference: 5.7 +/- 3, -2.4 +/- 2.4, 3.2 +/- 2.5, p = 0.04 and (3) mean: 14.3 +/- 3, 7 +/- 2.9, 12.4 +/- 2.9, p 0.03, diastolic aortic pressure was 28.1 +/- 2.5, 20.7 +/- 1.9, 20.9 +/- 2.1, p = 0.0125; ICP during decompression was 22.8 +/- 1.7, 23 +/- 1.5, 19.7 +/- 1.7, p = n.s. and mean ICP was 37.1 +/- 2.3, 35.5 +/- 2.2, 35.2 +/- 2.4, p = n.s.; RA diastolic pressure 4.8 +/- 1.3, 5.6 +/- 1.2, 4.3 +/- 1.2 p = 0.1; MAP was 52 +/- 2.9, 43.3 +/- 3, 48.3 +/- 2.9, p = 0.04; decompression endotracheal pressure, -0.7 +/- 0.1, -0.3 +/- 0.1, -0.75 +/- 0. 1, p = 0.045.
   Conclusions: Incomplete chest wall recoil during the decompression phase of CPR increases endotracheal pressure, impedes venous return and decreases mean arterial pressure, and coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Comparison Between Pressure Wire and Microcatheter Measurements for
   Evaluating the Cerebral Venous Pressure Gradient
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Introduction: A pressure gradient of over 8 mm Hg across the stenosis (usually located in the transverse-sigmoid junction) is one of the criteria for cerebral venous stenting in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients. The possible inaccuracy of the traditional microcatheter-based pressure measurements has been discussed in previous studies. In the cardiology field, a dual-sensor pressure wire is routinely used for the evaluation of stenotic lesions. Using a pressure wire for cerebral vasculature was previously discussed in a small case series and case reports. In this study, we compared venous pressure measurements obtained using both a microcatheter and a pressure wire in patients who were candidates for stenting.</p>
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted, comparing the two methods of pressure measurements in 26 patients with venous stenosis. Altogether, 120 measurements were performed using both methods. Demographic characteristics, medical history, procedural details, medications, indications for the procedure, and complications were collected from the patient charts.</p>
   Results: Based on an 8-mm Hg pressure gradient cutoff indication, 19 patients were found eligible to go through unilateral venous stenting based on catheter measurements alone. The wire results corroborated the catheter results in detecting all cases indicated for a stent. This finding implies a sensitivity equal to 100% for the wire measurements. There were no wire-related complications, demonstrating its safety.</p>
   Conclusions: We conclude that the pressure wire is as safe as the microcatheter and can identify cases requiring intervention. A larger-scale study is needed to assess the measurement accuracy of the pressure wire in brain vasculature.</p>

TI Cerebral venous steal: Blood flow diversion with increased tissue
   pressure
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB PURPOSE: Flow, in areas with increased tissue pressure is described by a Starling resistor and is determined by the inflow pressure (P-i), the external pressure (P-e); and the outflow or venous pressure (P-v). Flow is in Zone 1 at P-e > P-i > P-v, Zone 2 at P-i > P-e > P-v, and Zone 3 at P-i > P-v > P-e. A focal tissue pressure increase after stroke or trauma may lead to a transition from Zone 1 or 2 in the center to Zone 3 in the periphery. We hypothesize that the coexistence of different zones may lead to steal-like, blood flow. diversion in the perifocal area.
   CONCEPT: We used a lumped-parameter model of two parallel Starling resistors with a common inflow. The first resistor,with higher P-e, represented the area with increased tissue pressure. The second resistor; with P-e(') = 0, represented the surrounding area. We evaluated the effects of venous pressure on the flow distribution between the two Starling resistors.
   RATIONALE: The model demonstrated blood flow diversion toward the second Starling resistor with low external pressure. High inflow resistance facilitates this "steal." Flow diversion is caused by effective outflow pressure differences for the Starling resistors (P-e for the first and P-v for the second): The venous pressure increase equilibrates the effective backpressure and decreases flow diversion. When the venous pressure equals the external tissue pressure, blood flow diversion (cerebral venous steal) is abolished. Although increased venous pressure causes global flow reduction, it may restore flow to more than 50% of baseline values in areas of increased tissue pressure.
   DISCUSSION: Cerebral venous steal is a potential cause of secondary brain injury in areas of increased tissue pressure. It can be eliminated with increased venous pressure. Increased venous pressure may recruit the collapsed vascular network and correct perifocal perfusion maldistribution. This resembles how positive end expiratory pressure recruits collapsed airways and decreases the ventilation/perfusion mismatch.

TI Brain Death: Diagnosis and Imaging Techniques
SO SEMINARS IN ULTRASOUND CT AND MRI
AB Brain death (BD) is an irreversible cessation of functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem. The diagnosis of BD is made on clinical grounds and neurologic examination. In the United States, clinical criteria set by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) emphasize 3 specific clinical findings to confirm BD, which include coma, absence of brainstem reflexes and apnea. Ancillary tests are needed when neurologic examination or apnea test cannot be performed. AAN recommended ancillary tests include electroencephalogram, which confirms electrical activity loss; catheter cerebral angiogram, which confirms loss of cerebral blood flow; as well as transcranial Doppler and nuclear scintigraphy. Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard for confirmation of lack of cerebral blood flow. On 99m Techentium hexa methyl propylene amine oxime or 99mTechnetium-ethylene cysteine diethyl ester (99mTcethylene cysteine diethyl ester) Nuclear scintigraphy, lack of intracranial radiotracer uptake, correlates with BD. Although imaging studies like computed tomography angiogram (CTA), MR angiogram, CT perfusion, and MR perfusion are frequently used, they are currently not recommended by AAN. However, they hold tremendous promise in future as imaging tools in the armamentarium of a radiologist investigating BD as adjunct imaging to clinical findings. Imaging markers for BD on CTA include nonopacification of the cortical middle cerebral arteries and internal cerebral veins. On CT perfusion, there is lack of cerebral blood flow and blood volume in brainstem. Residual brain perfusion can occur with reduced intracranial pressure as in decompressive craniectomy, ventricular drainage and multiple skull fractures leading to false-negative results. On magnetic resonance imaging, there can be massive brain edema with herniations, poor gray or white matter differentiation, diffuse diffusion restriction, and nonvisualization of intracranial vessels on MR angiogram. On transcranial Doppler, cerebral circulatory arrest is indicated by flow patterns without forward flow progress, progressing from decrease in diastolic flow to disappearance of diastolic flow to oscillating pattern with retrograde flow in diastole, short systolic spikes, and finally absence of Doppler signal. AAN has included neuroimaging explaining coma as one of their prerequisite to be checked before evaluation for BD. Thus, a radiologist can play a critical role by recognizing the initial extensive hypoxic or ischemic damage to the central nervous system including the brainstem on imaging; guiding a neurologist evaluating a potential BD, as well as ruling out other pitfalls. In many cases, the radiologist is often the first person to appreciate the devastating findings of irreversible brain damage. Three most common mimics of BD are hypothermia, locked-in syndrome, and drug intoxication. By judicious usage of the available ancillary tests, cautiously interpreting the findings with awareness of their limitations and pitfalls, a radiologist can provide the support needed to confirm BD.

TI ABDOMINAL COMPARTMENT SYNDROME
SO SOVREMENNYE TEHNOLOGII V MEDICINE
AB We considered one of the most complicated problems of surgery and intensive care - abdominal compartment syndrome. It is a severe, and in some cases lethal complication developing in major injuries and pathology of abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal space, as well as in extra-abdominal pathology. In addition, compartment syndrome can be the complication of a number of surgical procedures accompanied primarily by laparotomy wound closure with tissue tension. We demonstrated the classification of the complication taking into consideration the etiology, pathogenesis of intra-abdominal hypertension development, the significance of intra-abdominal pressure level, as well as its role in multi-organ failure development. We considered the methods of intra-abdominal pressure measurement, and the urinary pressure measurement using Unometer (TM) Abdo-Pressure (TM) device turned out to be the most accurate, simple and safe. The preventive and treatment modalities of abdominal compartment syndrome were described. The monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure level in risk group patients, adequate infusion therapy, timely decompression (nasogastrointestinal intubation, decompressive laparotomy), and optimal respiratory support conditions are of primary importance.

TI Cranial venous outflow obstruction in the pseudotumour syndrome:
   incidence, nature and relevance
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB This study reports a retrospective analysis of the evidence of cranial venous outflow pathology in 188 patients with pseudotumour syndrome (PTS) investigated over the period 1968-1999. Standard methods of investigation appropriate to the period were used, i.e. cerebral angiography, CT and MR scanning. Recently, some patients had specific venous studies including intraluminal cranial venous sinus pressure measurements. A sub-group (25 patients) was investigated for haematological abnormalities. The overall incidence of cranial venous outflow abnormality was 19.7% (37 cases). In decades, related to the predominant investigative method, the figures were: to 1979, 4.2% (2 cases); to 1989, 15.0% (8 cases); to 1999, 31.0% (27 cases). A cause of the venous abnormality was identified in 20 cases, most commonly haematological and iatrogenic. In 17 patients (all females) no cause was identified. Fifteen of the 25 patients (60%) tested specifically were found to have a haematological abnormality, although no correlation was shown between this and a demonstrable venous outflow abnormality. The conclusion was drawn that there is a high incidence (close to one-third) of venous outflow abnormalities in PTS with detailed investigation. Issues of mechanism and therapy are discussed.

TI Pseudotumor Cerebri Associated With Modified Fontan Anatomy
SO PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
AB Surgical treatment of functional single-ventricle heart disease with a modified Fontan procedure results in elevated central venous pressure. The case report describes a 19-year-old boy with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and Fontan palliation that resulted in frequent debilitating headaches after transcatheter closure of systemic venous-to-pulmonary venous collaterals. Measured increased intracranial pressure and prompt relief of the headaches with lumbar puncture favored a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri. After implantation of a lumboperitoneal shunt, the patient's headaches improved dramatically. Headaches are frequent in patients with Fontan circulation. The current literature supports a pivotal role of elevated dural venous sinus pressure in the pathogenesis of pseudotumor cerebri. The high superior and inferior vena caval pressures characteristic of modified Fontan anatomy may account for headaches in some of these patients.

TI Quantifying the Cerebral Hemodynamics of Dural Arteriovenous Fistula in
   Transverse Sigmoid Sinus Complicated by Sinus Stenosis: A Retrospective
   Cohort Study
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sinus stenosis occasionally occurs in dural arteriovenous fistulas. Sinus stenosis impedes venous outflow and aggravates intracranial hypertension by reversing cortical venous drainage. This study aimed to analyze the likelihood of sinus stenosis and its impact on cerebral hemodynamics of various types of dural arteriovenous fistulas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three cases of dural arteriovenous fistula in the transverse-sigmoid sinus were reviewed and divided into 3 groups: Cognard type I, type Ha, and types with cortical venous drainage. Sinus stenosis and the double peak sign (occurrence of 2 peaks in the time-density curve of the ipsilateral drainage of the internal jugular vein) in dural arteriovenous fistula were evaluated. "TTP" was defined as the time at which a selected angiographic point reached maximum concentration. TTP of the vein of Labbe, TTP of the ipsilateral normal transverse sinus, trans-fistula time, and trans-stenotic time were compared across the 3 groups.
   RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of type 1,100% of type IIa, and 84% of types with cortical venous drainage had sinus stenosis. All sinus stenosis cases demonstrated loss of the double peak sign that occurs in dural arteriovenous fistula. Trans-fistula time (2.09 seconds) and transstenotic time (0.67 seconds) in types with cortical venous drainage were the most prolonged, followed by those in type I la and type I. TTP of the vein of Labbe was significantly shorter in types with cortical venous drainage. Six patients with types with cortical venous drainage underwent venoplasty and stent placement, and 4 were downgraded to type IIa.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sinus stenosis indicated dysfunction of venous drainage and is more often encountered in dural arteriovenous fistula with more aggressive types. Venoplasty ameliorates cortical venous drainage in dural arteriovenous fistulas and serves as a bridge treatment to stereotactic radiosurgery in most cases.

TI Angiographic aspects and management of dural arteriovenous fistulas
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN NEUROSURGERY
AB The angiographic analysis of a dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a determinant step in the evaluation of the lesion with regard to its prognosis and treatment. The clinical presentation of the dural AVFs is very dependent on the venous drainage, and the classification of these lesions draws attention to the venous drainage pattern, combining the clinical course and the venous drainage angiographic features. Dural AVFs with retrograde venous drainage into the leptomeningeal veins are associated with an increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, neurological deficits, and increased intracranial pressure allowing impairment of cognitive functions and dementia. Other risky findings are venous dilatations and dural sinus stenosis/occlusion. Different therapeutic approaches are available including noninvasive, endovascular, and surgical techniques. However, the treatment of dural AVFs should be considered in relation to the different types of lesions carrying different clinical presentation and prognosis. Prompt treatment allowing complete and permanent cure is mandatory in dural AVFs with an aggressive clinical course and/or with radiological findings predicting a severe prognosis.

TI Vascular etiology of intracranial hypertension
SO BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA
AB Intracranial hypertension is an important problem in neurology and neurosurgery. Some authors consider that there are differences between idiopathic intracranial hypertension and intracranial hypertension caused by sinus thrombosis or stenosis, but others consider that intracranial venous sinus thrombosis and stenosis are the main etiological factors for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The aim of this study was to present the characteristics that differentiate between idiopathic intracranial hypertension and intracranial hypertension caused by intracranial vascular damage. This prospective study included twenty-one patients, 14 women and 7 men of 18 - 61 years old. The main symptoms and the imaging findings diagnosed intracranial hypertension in the absence of an expansive intracranial process, hydrocephalus and intracranial infection. Cerebral angiography with venous phases showed whether there was cerebral vascular disease (cerebral venous thrombosis, venous sinus thrombosis or stenosis). The pressure of the cerebro-spinal fluid was determined by repeated lumbar puncture with manometry after the exclusion of endocranial lesions by cerebral explorations. The analysis of the symptomatology correlated with the values of intracranial pressure, and the imaging findings revealed significant differences between these two types of intracranial hypertension. Vascular intracranial hypertension has a known etiology, such as cerebral vascular illness, and a relatively rapid increase in intracranial pressure of approximately 21 cm H2O. Intracranial hypertension caused by intracranial vascular damage is named vascular intracranial hypertension. The treatment of vascular intracranial hypertension is etiologic, pathogenic and symptomatic, but that of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is only symptomatic.

TI Defining a Taxonomy of Intracranial Hypertension Is ICP More Than Just a
   Number?
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and control is a cornerstone of neuroanesthesia and neurocritical care. However, because elevated ICP can be due to multiple pathophysiological processes, its interpretation is not straightforward. We propose a formal taxonomy of intracranial hypertension, which defines ICP elevations into 3 major pathophysiological subsets: increased cerebral blood volume, masses and edema, and hydrocephalus. (1) Increased cerebral blood volume increases ICP and arises secondary to arterial or venous hypervolemia. Arterial hypervolemia is produced by autoregulated or dysregulated vasodilation, both of which are importantly and disparately affected by systemic blood pressure. Dysregulated vasodilation tends to be worsened by arterial hypertension. In contrast, autoregulated vasodilation contributes to intracranial hypertension during decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure that occur within the normal range of cerebral autoregulation. Venous hypervolemia is produced by Starling resistor outflow obstruction, venous occlusion, and very high extracranial venous pressure. Starling resistor outflow obstruction tends to arise when cerebrospinal fluid pressure causes venous compression to thus increase tissue pressure and worsen tissue edema (and ICP elevation), producing a positive feedback ICP cycle. (2) Masses and edema are conditions that increase brain tissue volume and ICP, causing both vascular compression and decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure leading to oligemia. Brain edema is either vasogenic or cytotoxic, each with disparate causes and often linked to cerebral blood flow or blood volume abnormalities. Masses may arise from hematoma or neoplasia. (3) Hydrocephalus can also increase ICP, and is either communicating or noncommunicating. Further research is warranted to ascertain whether ICP therapy should be tailored to these physiological subsets of intracranial hypertension.

TI Intracranial Pressure Declines During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in
   Animal Model
SO BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK
AB Intracranial hypertension represents a significant risk factor of poor neurological outcome in critically ill, specifically those with craniotrauma.
   Methods: In a porcine model of cardiac arrest (CA) the dynamics of intracranial pressure (ICP) was studied. Threeminutes of untreated CA were followed by 5-minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compressions and mechanical ventilation. No other interventions were allowed since out-of-hospital resuscitation was simulated. Throughout the protocol the ICP, arterial and venous pressures and carotid blood flow were continuously recorded.
   Results: During cardiac arrest ICP increased to 27 +/- 4.8 mmHg, i.e. hypertensive values. Mechanical chest compressions resulted in a transient ICP increase followed by a steady decline at approximately 2.25 mmHg/min. By five minutes of CPR intracranial pressure reached prearrest values despite significant elevation of central venous pressure (39 mmHg) and gradual decrease of arterial pressure and flow. We hypothesize that cerebral autoregulation is capable of maintaining ICP even during failing circulation.

TI Endovascular treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension -
   Clinical and radiologic outcome of 10 consecutive patients
SO NEUROLOGY
AB Objective: To explore the relation between venous disease and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Background: Optic nerve sheath fenestration and ventricular shunting are the classic methods when medical treatment has failed. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is caused by venous sinus obstruction in an unknown percentage of cases. Recently, endoluminal venous sinus stenting was proposed as an alternative treatment.
   Methods: Ten consecutive patients with refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension underwent examination with direct retrograde cerebral venography and manometry to characterize the morphologic features and venous pressures in their cerebral venous sinus. All patients demonstrated morphologic obstruction of the venous lateral sinuses. The CSF pressure was measured in all patients. The CSF pressure on lumbar puncture ranged from 27 to 45 mm Hg with normal composition. All patients had headache, and visual acuity loss was noted in eight patients. Funduscopic examination demonstrated papilledema for all patients. All patients had stenting of the venous sinuses. Intrasinus pressures were recorded before and after the procedure and correlated with clinical outcome.
   Results: Intrasinus pressures were invariably reduced by stenting. For headache, six patients were rendered asymptomatic, two were improved, and two were unchanged after venous sinus stenting for a mean (+/- SD) follow-up of 17 +/- 10.1 months (range 6 to 36 months). Papilledema disappeared in all patients. In all cases, CSF pressure was normalized at 3-month follow-up. In all patients, direct retrograde cerebral venography or multidetector row CT angiography was performed at 6-month follow-up and demonstrated the absence of stent thrombosis.
   Conclusion: The importance of venous sinus disease in the etiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is probably underestimated. Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension in whom a venous sinus stenosis is demonstrated by a noninvasive radiologic workup should be evaluated with direct retrograde cerebral venography and manometry. In patients with a lesion of the venous sinuses who experienced medical treatment failure, endovascular stent placement seems to be an interesting alternative to classic surgical approaches.

TI CAROTID CAVERNOUS FISTULAS - INDICATIONS FOR URGENT TREATMENT
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Angiographic and clinical data from 155 patients with carotid cavernous fistulae were retrospectively reviewed to determine angiographic features associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. These features included presence of a pseudoaneurysm, large varix of the cavernous sinus, venous drainage to cortical veins, and thrombosis of venous outflow pathways distant from the fistula. Clinical signs and symptoms that characterized a hazardous carotid cavernous fistula included increased intracranial pressure, rapidly progressive proptosis, diminished visual acuity, hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attacks. Cortical venous drainage from the carotid cavernous fistula is secondary to occlusion or absence of the normal venous outflow pathways and is associated with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and an increased risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Angiographic demonstration of a cavernous sinus varix, with extension of the sinus into the  subarachnoid space, is associated with an increased risk of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Identification of these high-risk features provides a basis for making decisions about treatment.

TI Cerebral venous etiology of intracranial hypertension and
   differentiation from idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO KAOHSIUNG JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB This study presents the characteristics that distinguish between idiopathic intracranial hypertension (ICH) and ICH caused by intracranial vascular damage. Twenty-one patients with ICH were included in this study. The analysis of the symptomatology correlated with the values of intracranial pressure, and the imaging findings revealed significant differences between these two types of ICH. ICH caused by intracranial venous vascular damage is named vascular ICH. Vascular ICH has a known etiology, such as cerebral vascular illness, and a relatively rapid increase in intracranial pressure of approximately 21 cmH(2)O and imaging findings show characteristic images of thrombosis or stenosis of the intracranial venous system, while all brain images (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, angio-magnetic resonance imaging) are normal in idiopathic ICH. The treatment of vascular ICH is etiologic, pathogenic, and symptomatic, but that of idiopathic ICH is only symptomatic. Copyright (C) 2015, Kaohsiung Medical University.

TI Treatment of refractory low-pressure hydrocephalus with an active
   pumping negative-pressure shunt system
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Low-pressure hydrocephalus is a rare type of hydrocephalus characterized by negative intracranial pressure (ICP) and ventriculomegaly. Given the shortcomings of available methods to treat refractory low-pressure hydrocephalus, we set out to develop a new system for evacuation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricular system where existing shunt systems do not produce the necessary gradient for CSF drainage. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of two patients with the diagnosis of negative-pressure hydrocephalus refractory to traditional treatments. We combined a traditional low-pressure, non-siphoning valve with a pumping chamber placed distal to the valve to create a system that could be actively pumped to remove excess CSF. Treatment of negative-pressure hydrocephalus requires the establishment of a lower ventricular drainage pressure than the drainage pressure in the subarachnoid space. In refractory cases, we propose the use of this active negative-pressure pumping system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB It is probable that a significant number of cases of pseudotumor syndrome (PTS) occur because of cranial venous out-flow obstruction, yet reports of direct treatment of the obstruction are few and inconclusive. In this study the authors report three cases of PTS with angiographically confirmed venous sinus obstruction treated by direct, endovascular procedures; urokinase infusion in two and balloon venoplasty in one. Two patients suffered transient complications that resolved satisfactorily. All three showed initial resolution of the signs and symptoms of PTS but one relapsed after 8 months and required surgical treatment. The possible role and methods of treatment of cranial venous outflow obstruction in PTS are discussed.

TI Coupling of Central Venous Pressure and Intracranial Pressure in a
   6-Year-Old Patient With Fontan Circulation and Intracranial Hemorrhage
SO ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
AB A sharp rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) was noted in a 6-year-old girl with Fontan circulation after surgical removal of a hematoma associated with intracranial hemorrhage. Inhalation of nitric oxide resulted in reduction of central venous pressure (CVP) and precipitous fall in ICP, which was otherwise resistant to conventional therapy. Specifically, the rate of fall of ICP (9 mm Hg) exceeded that of the CVP (3 mm Hg), indicating disproportionate CVP-ICP coupling. The present case provides not only a novel insight into cardio-cerebral interaction in Fontan physiology but also useful information regarding the treatment of Fontan patients in the setting of increased ICP.

TI Interhospital Transfer of Neurosurgical Patients to a High-Volume
   Tertiary Care Center: Opportunities for Improvement Comment
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND:
   Endovascular stenting is an effective treatment for patients with clinically significant cerebral venous sinus stenosis. Traditionally, stenting is indicated in elevated intravenous pressures on conventional venography; however, noninvasive monitoring is more desirable. Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography is an imaging modality that measures blood flow noninvasively. Established in the arterial system, applications to the venous sinuses have been limited.
   OBJECTIVE:
   To examine quantitative magnetic resonance venography (qMRV) in the measurement of venous sinus flow in patients undergoing endovascular stenting and to identify a relationship with intravenous pressures.
   METHODS:
   Five patients with intracranial hypertension secondary to venous sinus stenosis underwent cerebral venous stenting between 2009 and 2013 at a single institution. Preoperatively, venous sinus flow was determined by using qMRV, and intravenous pressure was measured during venography. After stenting, intravenous pressure, qMRV flow, and clinical outcomes were assessed and compared.
   RESULTS:
   A mean prestenotic intravenous pressure of 45.2 mm Hg was recorded before stenting, which decreased to 27.4 mm Hg afterward (Wilcoxon signed rank test P = .04). Total jugular outflow on qMRV increased by 260.2 mL/min. Analysis of the change in intravenous pressure and qMRV flow identified a linear relationship (Pearson correlation r = 0.926). All patients displayed visual improvement at 6 weeks.
   CONCLUSION:
   Venous outflow by qMRV increases after endovascular stenting and correlates with significantly improved intravenous pressures. These findings introduce qMRV as a potential adjunct to measure venous flow after stenting, and as a plausible tool in the selection and postoperative surveillance of the patient who has cerebral venous sinus stenosis.

TI Intra-Abdominal Pressure Measurements in Neurocritical Patients
SO JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
AB Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is increasingly being recognized as an indispensable and significant physiological parameter in intensive care units (ICU). IAP has been measured in a variety of ways with the development of many techniques in recent years. The level of intra-abdominal pressure under normal conditions is generally equal to or less than 12 mmHg. Accordingly, abdominal hypertension (IAH) is defined as two consecutive IAP measurements higher than 12 mmHg within 4-6 h. When IAH deteriorates further with IAP higher than 20 mmHg along with organ dysfunction and/or failure, this clinical manifestation can be diagnosed as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). IAH and ACS are associated with gastrointestinal ischemia, acute renal failure, and lung injury, leading to severe morbidity and mortality. Elevated IAP and IAH may affect the cerebral venous return and outflow of the cerebrospinal fluid by increasing the intrathoracic pressure (ITP), ultimately leading to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Therefore, it is essential to monitor IAP in critically ill patients. The reproducibility and accuracy of intra-bladder pressure (IBP) measurements in previous studies need to be further improved, although the indirect measurement of IAP is now a widely used technique. To address these limitations, we recently used a set of IAP monitoring systems with advantages of convenience, continuous monitoring, digital visualization, and long-term IAP recording and data storage in critically ill patients. This IAP monitoring system can detect intra-abdominal hypertension and potentially analyze clinical status in real time. The recorded IAP data and other physiological indicators, such as intracranial pressure, can be further used for correlation analysis to guide treatment and predict a patient's possible prognosis.

TI Spontaneous resolution of intracranial hypertension following
   radiotherapy for posterior parasagittal meningioma: About two cases and
   review of the literature
SO CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE
AB We report the cases of two patients who underwent normofractionated radiotherapy for evolutive asymptomatic parasagittal meningiomas. After completion of radiotherapy, both patients presented severe headache and vomiting episodes without papillar edema. We then decided a "wait-and-scan" strategy because of the slit-ventricles, and symptoms regressed spontaneously. MRI showed significant tumor regression a year after radiotherapy with a newly developed collateral venous drainage system in the first patient and a left, unusually large, superior anastomotic vein in the second. These clinical presentation and radiological evolution are compatible with venous stenosis caused by radiation-induced symptomatic edema, fading after the development of a collateral venous drainage system. The relation between pressure-related headaches and venous anatomy remains unclear in parasagittal meningiomas. These observations underline the importance of the study of venous anatomy when pressure-related headaches are suspected. Further clinical descriptions might help the clinicians to treat these patients' symptoms.& COPY; 2023 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI CEREBRAL DURAL ARTERIOVENOUS-FISTULAS CLINICAL AND ANGIOGRAPHIC
   CORRELATION WITH A REVISED CLASSIFICATION OF VENOUS DRAINAGE
SO RADIOLOGY
AB PURPOSE: To review the symptoms and progression of dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and correlate the findings with various angiographic patterns.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patterns of venous drainage allowed classification of dural AVFs into five types: type I, located in the main sinus, with antegrade flow; type II, in the main sinus, with reflux into the sinus (IIa), cortical veins (IIb), or both (IIa + b); type III, with direct cortical venous drainage without venous ectasia; type IV, with direct cortical venous drainage with venous ectasia; and type V, with spinal venous drainage.
   RESULTS: Type I dural AVFs had a benign course. In type II, reflux into the sinus induced intracranial hypertension in 20% of cases, and reflux into cortical veins induced hemorrhage in 10%. Hemorrhage was present in 40% of cases of type III dural AVFs and 65% of type IV. Type V produced progressive myelopathy in 50% of cases.
   CONCLUSION: This classification provides useful data for determination of the risk with each dural AVF and enables decision-making about the appropriate therapy.

TI Resolution of pseudotumor cerebri after bariatric surgery for related
   obesity - Case report
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Two obese women, both of whom were 42 years of age, were examined for pseudotumor cerebri. Intracranial venography revealed increased pressure in the dural venous sinuses and the right atrium. The increased right atrial pressure was attributable to the patients' obesity. Both patients underwent bariatric surgery to achieve weight loss. Approximately 1 year later, a clinical evaluation showed that in both women the pseudotumor cerebri had resolved. Repeated measurements of dural venous pressure indicated that the patients' pressures had returned to normal. Obese patients with pseudotumor cerebri and stable visual symptoms are best treated with weight loss to avoid shunt placement or optic nerve sheath fenestration.

TI Abdominal insufflation for laparoscopy increases intracranial and
   intrathoracic pressure in human subjects
SO SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
AB Laparoscopy has emerged as an alternative to laparotomy in select trauma patients. In animal models, increasing abdominal pressure is associated with an increase in intrathoracic and intracranial pressures. We conducted a prospective trial of human subjects who underwent laparoscopic-assisted ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (lap VPS) with intraoperative measurement of intrathoracic, intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures.
   Ten patients undergoing lap VPS were recruited. Abdominal insufflation was performed using CO2 to 0, 8, 10, 12 and 15 mmHg. ICP was measured through the ventricular catheter simultaneously with insufflation and with desufflation using a manometer. Peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) were measured through the endotracheal tube. Blood pressure was measured using a noninvasive blood pressure cuff. End-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) was measured for each set of abdominal pressure level. Pressure measurements from all points of insufflation were compared using a two-way ANOVA with a post hoc Bonferroni test. Mean changes in pressures were compared using t test.
   ICP and PIP increased significantly with increasing abdominal pressure (both p < 0.01), whereas cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and mean arterial pressure did not significantly change with increasing abdominal pressure over the range tested. Higher abdominal pressure values were associated with decreased ETCO2 values.
   Increased ICP and PIP appear to be a direct result of increasing abdominal pressure, since ETCO2 did not increase. Though CPP did not change over the range tested, the ICP in some patients with 15 mmHg abdominal insufflation reached values as high as 32 cmH(2)O, which is considered above tolerance, regardless of the CPP. Laparoscopy should be used cautiously, in patients who present with baseline elevated ICP or head trauma as abdominal insufflation affects intracranial pressure.

We present 3 case reports in which diagnostic imaging before and after CSF diversion provided evidence that narrowing of the transverse sinuses is a secondary phenomenon. Stent angioplasty of the venous sinuses should not be considered a therapeutic approach in these cases.

TI Venous waveform morphological changes associated with treatment of
   symptomatic venous sinus stenosis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Introduction Venous outflow obstruction is recognized as a contributing factor in a subset of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Little is known about venous sinus waveform morphology or how it changes after stenting.
   Methods Fifteen patients with IIH underwent waveform recording during catheter venography and manometry. Ten patients (Group A) with venous sinus stenosis and pressure gradient 7 mm Hg underwent waveform recording during awake venography and during stenting under general anesthesia. Five control IIH patients (Group B) without a gradient underwent awake recording only.
   Results Group A patients underwent successful stenting with reduction of their gradient from 15.16.19 mm Hg to 1.2 +/- 0.60 mm Hg. This resulted in an amplitude reduction from 8.3mm Hg to 2.8mm Hg (P=0.02). Qualitative evaluation of the waveform yielded a number of novel findings. In Group A before stenting, the observed waveform progressed from an intracranial pressure (ICP)-dominated to central venous pressure (CVP)-dominated waveform. Stenting abolished the high amplitude waveform and smoothed the transition from the intracranial to central venous measurement points. Group B displayed primarily CVP-influenced waveforms distal and proximal to the transverse-sigmoid junction along with respiratory variability of the waveform, absent in 8/10 Group A patients. General anesthesia appeared to blunt the waveform in 5/10 Group A patients.
   Conclusion The cerebral venous waveform appears to be influenced by both the ICP and CVP waveforms. As measurement moves proximally, the waveform progressively changes to mirror the CVP waveform. Venous sinus stenosis results in a high amplitude waveform which improves with treatment of the stenosis.

TI Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Venography is Correlated With
   Intravenous Pressures Before and After Venous Sinus Stenting:
   Implications for Treatment and Monitoring
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND:Endovascular stenting is an effective treatment for patients with clinically significant cerebral venous sinus stenosis. Traditionally, stenting is indicated in elevated intravenous pressures on conventional venography; however, noninvasive monitoring is more desirable. Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography is an imaging modality that measures blood flow noninvasively. Established in the arterial system, applications to the venous sinuses have been limited.OBJECTIVE:To examine quantitative magnetic resonance venography (qMRV) in the measurement of venous sinus flow in patients undergoing endovascular stenting and to identify a relationship with intravenous pressures.METHODS:Five patients with intracranial hypertension secondary to venous sinus stenosis underwent cerebral venous stenting between 2009 and 2013 at a single institution. Preoperatively, venous sinus flow was determined by using qMRV, and intravenous pressure was measured during venography. After stenting, intravenous pressure, qMRV flow, and clinical outcomes were assessed and compared.RESULTS:A mean prestenotic intravenous pressure of 45.2 mm Hg was recorded before stenting, which decreased to 27.4 mm Hg afterward (Wilcoxon signed rank test P = .04). Total jugular outflow on qMRV increased by 260.2 mL/min. Analysis of the change in intravenous pressure and qMRV flow identified a linear relationship (Pearson correlation r = 0.926). All patients displayed visual improvement at 6 weeks.CONCLUSION:Venous outflow by qMRV increases after endovascular stenting and correlates with significantly improved intravenous pressures. These findings introduce qMRV as a potential adjunct to measure venous flow after stenting, and as a plausible tool in the selection and postoperative surveillance of the patient who has cerebral venous sinus stenosis.

TI Superior Ophthalmic Vein Flow Patterns as a Marker of Venous Sinus
   Stenosis and Hypertension in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: A
   Case of Emergent Transverse Sinus Stenting as Treatment of Fulminant
   Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Fulminant idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can cause rapid vision loss. Transverse sinus stenosis is a finding commonly associated with IIH, and transverse sinus stenting has been used to rapidly reduce intracranial pressure and improve visual symptoms. Our objective was to describe a case of immediate alteration in reversed superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) flow in a fulminant IIH patient who underwent venous sinus stenting.
   METHODS: All charts, imaging, and notes spanning from the initial presentation to the post-intervention follow-up were reviewed and summarized for inclusion.
   RESULTS: A 24-year-old woman presented with several weeks of severe headaches and progressive vision loss. She was found to have severe papilledema and the opening pressure on lumbar puncture (LP) was 70 mm Hg. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated findings consistent with elevated intracranial pressure, and CT venography revealed stenosis of the right transverse sinus. She underwent an uncomplicated diagnostic cerebral angiogram, right venous sinus manometry, and right transverse to sigmoid sinus stenting procedure. Prior to deployment of the stent, a trans-stenotic pressure gradient of 12 mm Hg was observed within the right transverse-sigmoid junction, and flow through the bilateral SOVs was retrograde. Following stent placement, the pressure gradient normalized, and SOV flow was bidirectional. She subjectively reported improved vision, and there was improving papilledema. Repeat LP yielded an opening pressure of 21.6 mm Hg.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates reversed SOV flow should be considered an indicator of severe venous sinus stenosis, and restoration to normal or near normal state following stenting for IIH is likely indicative of procedural success.

TI Papilloedema and Increased Intracranial Pressure as a Result of
   Unilateral Jugular Vein Thrombosis
SO NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Intracranial hypertension and papilloedema are known to develop secondary to cerebral sinus or bilateral jugular vein thrombosis. However, in rare cases, unilateral jugular vein thrombosis may lead to increased intracranial pressure and papilloedema with resultant headache and vision changes. We describe a 45-year-old patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx that developed right jugular vein thrombosis after chemoradiation therapy with cetuximab. This was later complicated by intracranial hypertension and papilloedema. The normal cerebral venous drainage, the potential role of chemoradiation therapy on the aetiology of jugular vein thrombosis, and the mechanism of increased intracranial pressure secondary to unilateral jugular vein occlusion are discussed.

TI EFFECT OF POSITIVE END EXPIRATORY PRESSURE VENTILATION ON
   INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE IN MAN
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB The effect of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation on intracranial pressure (ICP) was investigated. In 25 patients with severe head trauma with and without associated pulmonary injury the following parameters were simultaneously monitored under mechanical ventilation with and without PEEP: ICP, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, arterial blood gases and cardiac rate. The volume-pressure response (VPR) was evaluated in each patient to assess cerebral elastance. There was a significant increase in ICP with the application of PEEP only in the 12 patients who manifested increased cerebral elastance by VPR. Half of this latter group manifested impairment of cerebral perfusion pressure to levels less than 60 mm Hg. Return to baseline ICP levels was observed with termination of PEEP. No significantly consistent changes in other parameters were noted.

TI DETERMINATION OF OPTIMUM RETROGRADE CEREBRAL PERFUSION CONDITIONS
SO JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB Retrograde cerebral perfusion through a superior vena caval cannula is a new technique used to protect the brain during operations on the aortic arch. We measured cerebral tissue blood flow, oxygen consumption, and cerebrospinal fluid pressure under various perfusion conditions in hypothermic (20 degrees C) mongrel dogs (n = 18, 12.8 +/- 0.6 kg) to determine the optimum conditions for retrograde cerebral perfusion. Retrograde cerebral perfusion was performed by infusion via the superior vena caval cannula and drainage via the ascending aortic cannula while the inferior vena cava and azygos vein were clamped. Retrograde cerebral perfusion was performed as the external jugular venous pressure was changed from 15 to 35 mm Hg in increments of 5 mm Hg. Cerebral tissue blood how was measured by the hydrogen clearance method. Hypothermic retrograde cerebral perfusion with an external jugular venous pressure of 25 mm Hg provided about half the cerebral tissue blood flow of hypothermic (20 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass with a flow rate of 1000 ml/min (13.7 +/- 7.9 versus 32.7 +/- 8.5 ml/min per 100 gm). It decreased significantly as the external jugular venous pressure was decreased from 25 to 15 mm Hg but did not increase significantly as the external jugular venous pressure was increased from 25 to 35 mm Hg. Whole-body oxygen consumption during hypothermic retrograde cerebral perfusion with an external jugular venous pressure of 25 mm Ng was one quarter of that during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (3.4 +/- 0.7 versus 12.7 +/- 5.6 ml/min) and varied in proportion to external jugular venous pressure. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure was a little lower than the external jugular venous pressure (19.2 +/- 4.5 mm Hg versus 24.8 +/- 2.4 mm Hg) but also varied with the external jugular venous pressure. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure remained lower than 25 mm Hg so long as the external jugular venous pressure remained lower than 25 mm Hg. High external jugular venous pressure was associated with high intracranial pressure, which restricts cerebral tissue blood flow and may cause brain edema. We believe that a venous pressure of 25 mm Hg is the optimum condition for retrograde cerebral perfusion.

TI Intracranial Venous Sinus Stenting: A Review of Idiopathic Intracranial
   Hypertension and Expanding Indications
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a functionally limiting disorder secondary to increased intracranial pressures (ICPs) with a prevalence of one per 100,000 persons. It is estimated to cost >$400 million per year in productively. Symptoms classically consist of chronic headaches, papilledema, and visual loss. The pathophysiology is unknown but postulated to involve increased resistance to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption. Traditional treatments involve weight loss, acetazolamide, CSF diversion, or optic nerve fenestration. More recent technology has allowed exploration of venous sinus stenosis. Through venous sinus stenting (VSS), the ICPs and venous sinus pressures decrease. After treatment, >75% exhibit an improvement in headaches, similar to 50% improvement in tinnitus, and similar to 50 % improvement in ophthalmologic testing. Complications are rare but involve stent stenosis, femoral pseudoaneurysm, and hemorrhages. Future studies will look into controlled studies for VSS as well as expansion to other venous structures of the intracranial circulation.

TI The abdominal compartment syndrome.
SO ANASTHESIOLOGIE INTENSIVMEDIZIN NOTFALLMEDIZIN SCHMERZTHERAPIE
AB The abdominal compartment is limited by the abdominal wall, Mm. Psoas, vertebral column, diaphragm and the pelvis. Thus the retroperitoneum is included. Elevated intraabdominal pressure may profoundly impair the function of the entire gastrointestinal tract, the cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal system. Reduction of increased intraabdominal pressure may reverse all these adverse effects. The most common causes of elevated intraabdominal pressure are abdominal operations, abdominal trauma, diffuse peritonitis, ascites and peritoneal edema following resuscitation. Excessively increased intraabdominal pressure may result in a total loss of function and may lead to death. Such a condition is called an abdominal compartment syndrome. It usually requires operative decompression. According to animal experiments and clinical experiences suggestions for treatment are given. Diagnostic suspicion of elevated intraabdominal pressure may be confirmed with objective measurements. Since bedside manometry using a Foley catheter provides a valuable estimate of intraabdominal pressure and is easy to perform, intraabdominal pressure values may contribute to medical decision malting. At this time there is a great need of controlled clinical trials to point out the importance of increased intraabdominal pressure and the abdominal compartment syndrome.

TI Brain Slump Caused by Jugular Venous Stenoses Treated by Stenting: A
   Hypothesis to Link Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension with Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY REPORTS
AB Spontaneous intracranial hypotension, of which brain slump is an extreme expression, is caused by a cerebrospinal fluid leak. The reason the leak develops in the first place, however, is unknown, and some cases can be very difficult to manage. We describe a patient with severe symptoms of spontaneous intracranial hypotension and brain slump documented by magnetic resonance imaging whose clinical syndrome and structural brain anomaly resolved completely after treatment directed exclusively at improving cranial venous outflow. Diagnostics included computed tomography (CT) venography, catheter venography, and jugular venoplasty. CT venography showed narrowing of both internal jugular veins below the skull base. Catheter venography confirmed that these were associated with pressure gradients. Jugular venoplasty performed on two separate occasions as a clinical test gave temporary respite. Lasting remission (2 years of follow-up) was achieved by stenting the dominant internal jugular vein. These findings and this outcome suggest a mechanism for the development of spontaneous intracranial hypotension that would link it to idiopathic intracranial hypertension and have cranial venous outflow obstruction as the underlying cause.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Purpose of review
   To review the current standard of care in the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We also discuss recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of IIH with emerging trends in management of this syndrome.
   Recent findings
   There has been increasing literature suggesting a role of vitamin A adipokines sleep disorders, and venous sinus stenosis in the pathogenesis of IIH. Newer medical treatment options like topiramate and surgical treatment options like stereotactic ventriculoperitoneal shunting have been found to be attractive alternatives. There has also been an emerging interest in cerebral venous sinus stenting, though its role and utility remain debatable.
   Summary
   This article seeks to present a systematic approach to the management of IIH. Many newer treatment modalities are being explored for IIH refractory to standard medical therapy, but their efficacy and safety must be demonstrated in large studies before they can be adopted as part of standard treatment.

TI Current Status of the Application of Intracranial Venous Sinus Stenting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB The intracranial venous sinus is an important component of vascular disease. Many diseases involve the venous sinus and are accompanied by venous sinus stenosis (VSS), which leads to increased venous pressure and high intracranial pressure. Recent research has focused on stenting as a treatment for VSS related to these diseases. However, a systematic understanding of venous sinus stenting (VS-Stenting) is lacking. Herein, the literature on idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), venous pulsatile tinnitus, sinus thrombosis, high draining venous pressure in dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and tumor-caused VSS was reviewed and analyzed to summarize experiences with VS-Stenting as a treatment. The literature review showed that satisfactory therapeutic effects can be achieved through stent angioplasty. Thus, the present study suggests that selective stent release in the venous sinus can effectively treat these diseases and provide new possibilities for treating intracranial vascular disease.

SO PROGRESS IN RETINAL AND EYE RESEARCH
AB Astronauts can develop a distinct collection of neuro-ophthalmic findings during long duration spaceflight, collectively known as Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). These clinical characteristics include optic disc edema, hyperopic refractive shifts, globe flattening, and chorioretinal folds, which may pose a health risk for future space exploration. Obtaining knowledge of SANS and countermeasures for its prevention is crucial for upcoming crewed space missions and warrants a multidisciplinary approach. This review examines the potential causes and countermeasures of SANS, including space anticipation glasses, lower body negative pressure, venoconstrictive thigh cuffs, impedance threshold devices, translaminar pressure gradient modulation, centrifugation, artificial gravity, pharmaceuticals, and precision nutritional supplementation. This paper highlights future research directions for understanding the genetic, anthropometric, behavioral, and environmental susceptibilities to SANS as well as how to use terrestrial analogs for testing future mitigation strategies.

TI Sinus Venous Stenosis-Associated Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
   Without Papilledema as a Powerful Risk Factor for Progression and
   Refractoriness of Headache
SO CURRENT PAIN AND HEADACHE REPORTS
AB Data from two recent studies strongly support the hypothesis that idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema (IIHWOP) could represent a powerful risk factor for the progression of pain in primary headache individuals. The first study highlights that an asymptomatic IIHWOP is much more prevalent than believed in the general population and occurs only in central venous stenosis carriers. In the second study, about one half of a large consecutive series of unresponsive primary chronic headache patients shows significant sinus venous stenosis. A continuous or intermittent IIHWOP was detectable in 91% of this subgroup and in no patient with normal venography. Moreover, after the lumbar puncture, a 2- to 4-week improvement in headache frequency was observed in most of the intracranial hypertensive patients. These findings strongly suggest that patients prone to primary headache who carry central venous outflow abnormalities are at high risk of developing a comorbid IIHWOP, which in turn is responsible for the progression and the unresponsiveness of the pain. Based on the available literature data, we propose that central sinus stenosis-related IIHWOP, although highly prevalent among otherwise healthy people, represents an important risk factor for the progression and refractoriness of pain in patients predisposed to primary headache. The mechanism could refer to up to one half of the primary chronic headache patients with minimal response to treatments referring to specialized headache clinics. Due to the clinical and taxonomic relevance of this hypothesis further studies are urgently needed.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been considered a precarious health issue especially within the military population. Research has shown that early treatment of TBI could reduce possible neurocognitive injury. However, the nature of military triage has created challenges for early TBI detection. Intracranial pressure (ICP), which is used as a biomarker of outcomes in TBI, is not only expensive to measure but is also invasive and requires specialized surgical and procedural skills. Episcleral venous pressure (EVP) was proven to be a good alternative biomarker to ICP. However, the current technology in measuring EVP is not portable, and requires a skilled operator with a slit-lamp for testing. Moreover, the measurement is highly subjective and depends on the operator's skill and technique. Therefore, there is a critical need for alternative technology for non-clinical TBI diagnosis. In this paper, we present an improved venomanometer design for measuring EVP in the field.

TI Dynamic internal jugular vein venography: a descriptive study in 89
   patients with suspected cerebral venous outflow disorders
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Internal jugular vein (IJV) stenosis has recently been recognized as a plausible source of symptom etiology in patients with cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVD). Diagnosis and determining surgical candidacy remains difficult due to a poor understanding of IJV physiology and positional symptom exacerbation often reported by these patients.Methods A retrospective single-center chart review was conducted on adult patients who underwent diagnostic cerebral venography with rotational IJ venography from 2022 to 2024. Patients were divided into three groups for further analysis based on symptoms and diagnostic criteria: presumed jugular stenosis, near-healthy venous outflow, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.Results Eighty-nine patients were included in the study. Most commonly, ipsilateral rotation resulted in ipsilateral IJV stenosis and gradient development at C4-6 and contralateral stenosis and gradient appearance in the contralateral IJV at C1, with stenosis and gradient development in bilateral IJVs at C1-3 bilaterally during chin flexion. In all patients, 93.3% developed at least moderate dynamic stenosis of at least one IJV, more than two-thirds (69.7%) developed either severe or occlusive stenosis during rightward and leftward rotation, and 81.8% developed severe or occlusive stenosis with head flexion. Dynamic gradients of at least 4 mmHg were seen in 68.5% of patients, with gradients of at least 8 mmHg in 31.5% and at least 10 mmHg in 12.4%.Conclusion This study is the first to document dynamic changes in IJV caliber and gradients in different head positions, offering insights into the complex nature of venous outflow and its impact on CVD.

AB OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Dural sinus thrombosis can lead to intracranial venous hypertension and can be complicated by intracranial hemorrhage. We present a case report of a patient who underwent endovascular recanalization and stenting of a thrombosed occipital sinus.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old patient with a history of chronic sinus thrombosis refractory to anticoagulant therapy presented with acute onset of aphasia and hemiparesis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed hydrocephalus and cerebral edema. Angiography delineated multiple dural arteriovenous fistulae and persistent occlusion of the posterior sagittal, occipital, and bilateral transverse dural sinuses with retrograde cortical venous drainage.
   INTERVENTION: After embolization of the dural arteriovenous fistulae, a transvenous approach was used to recanalize and perform balloon angioplasty of the right internal jugular vein and the occipital and left transverse sinuses, resulting in subsequent clinical improvement. The patient's condition deteriorated 3 days later with reocclusion of both balloon-dilated sinuses. Repeat angioplasty and then deployment of an endovascular stent in the occipital sinus were performed, and reestablishment of venous outflow was achieved, resulting in a decrease of intracranial venous pressure from 41 to 14 mm Hg and neurological improvement. At the 3-month follow-up examination, the stented occipital sinus remained patent and served as the only conduit for extracranial venous outflow; the patient remained neurologically intact at the 12-month follow-up examination.
   CONCLUSION: This is the first report of mechanical recanalization, balloon angioplasty, and stent deployment in the occipital sinus to provide sustained venous outflow for the treatment of venous hypertension with retrograde cortical venous drainage in a patient with dural pansinus thrombosis refractory to anticoagulant therapy.

TI Anomalous venous drainage in a case of non syndromic craniosynostosis
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB The authors describe the clinical and radiological findings in a case of non-syndromic craniosynostosis affecting multiple sutures, in which the intracranial venous drainage was grossly anomalous. Investigation by magnetic resonance imaging and angiography revealed that almost all of the intracranial venous blood was draining from the dural sinuses transosseoussly via enlarged emissary veins to the external jugular veins and the vertebral veins. Although present, both internal jugular veins were small. This discovery represented a contraindication for the vault expansion surgery that had been recommended as treatment for the patient's raised intracranial pressure, and it has important implications for the management of all types of craniosynostosis.

TI Intracranial Hypertension following Acute Mesenteric Ischemia: A Case
   Study on the Multiple Compartment Syndrome
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANGIOLOGY
AB In this case study, we describe a 25-year-old male who was admitted due to a severe traumatic brain injury, requiring invasive intracranial pressure monitoring. At 48 hours posttrauma, he developed intracranial hypertension refractory to medical treatment without tomographic changes in the brain. Subsequently, intra-abdominal hypertension and tomographic signs of abdominal surgical pathology were observed. An exploratory laparotomy was performed with an intraoperative diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia. After surgical intervention for the abdominal pathology, intracranial pressure was restored to physiological values with a favorable recovery of the patient. In this report, the relationship between intracranial pressure and intra-abdominal pressure is discussed, highlighting the delicate association between the brain, abdomen, and thorax. Measures should be taken to avoid increases in intra-abdominal pressure in neurocritical patients. When treating intracranial hypertension refractory to conventional measures, abdominal causes and multiple compartment syndrome must be considered. The cranial compartment has physiological interdependence with other body compartments, where one can be modified by variations from another, giving rise to the concept of multiple compartment syndrome. Understanding this relationship is fundamental for a comprehensive approach of the neurocritical patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a comatose patient post-traumatic brain injury, who developed medically unresponsive intracranial hypertension secondary to acute mesenteric ischemia, in which surgical resolution of intra-abdominal pathology resulted in intracranial pressure normalization and restitutio ad integrum of neurological status.

TI Accuracy and precision of venous pressure measurements of endovascular
   microcatheters in the setting of dural venous sinus stenosis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Introduction Dural venous sinus stenosis (DVSS) may lead to increased intracranial pressure, sometimes requiring a stent if a high pressure gradient exists. Many neuroendovascular physicians use microcatheters to measure gradients, yet there are no studies comparing the accuracies and precisions of modern day microcatheters. We examined pressure recordings from five commonly used microcatheters in an experimental DVSS model.
   Methods Using a programmable pump, dynamic flow was established in a closed circuit mimicking the venous sinus waveform. Microcatheters with 150 cm effective lengths were connected proximally to pressure transducers. Mean recording pressures were compared with a high fidelity microcatheter (HFM) in several configurations including no stenosis, proximal to a focal stenosis, and distal to a focal stenosis in opposing orientations.
   Results All microcatheters recorded lower pressures than the HFM. Three of the five microcatheters successfully met intracranial pressure monitoring device standards in all conditions, while one did not meet standards in any configuration. The performance of the final microcatheter was variable, with inaccuracies occurring in unrestricted flow. All microcatheters demonstrated relatively high precision, but with variable accuracies. The larger diameter microcatheters displayed the least damping and therefore the greatest accuracies. Of the three smaller microcatheters, dimensions did not predict performance, suggesting that microcatheter construction may also play a role in pressure accuracy.
   Conclusion The use of microcatheters to record dural venous sinus pressures must be done with an understanding of the inherent limitations and inaccuracies, especially if clinical decisions are made from the results.

TI Lower-body negative pressure decreases noninvasively measured
   intracranial pressure and internal jugular vein cross-sectional area
   during head-down tilt
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Longterm spaceflight induces a near visual acuity change in similar to 50% of astronauts. In some crew members, postflight cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressures by lumbar puncture are as high as 20.9 mmHg; these members demonstrated optic disc edema. CSF communicates through the cochlear aqueduct to affect perilymphatic pressure and tympanic membrane motion. We hypothesized that 50 mmHg of lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) during 15 degrees head-down tilt (HDT) would mitigate elevations in internal jugular vein cross-sectional area (IJV CSA) and intracranial pressure (ICP). Fifteen healthy adult volunteers were positioned in sitting (5 min), supine (5 min), 15 degrees HDT (5 min), and 15 HDT with LBNP (10 min) postures for data collection. Evoked tympanic membrane displacements (TMD) quantified ICP noninvasively. IJV CSA was measured using standard ultrasound techniques. ICP and IJV CSA increased significantly from the seated upright to the 15 degrees HDT posture (P < 0.05), and LBNP mitigated these increases. LBNP at 25 mmHg reduced ICP during HDT (TMD of 322.13 +/- 419.17 nl) to 232.38 +/- 445.85 nl, and at 50 mmHg ICP was reduced further to TMD of 199.76 +/- 429.69 nl. In addition, 50 mmHg LBNP significantly reduced IJV CSA (1.50 +/- 0.33 cm(2)) during 15 HDT to 0.83 +/- 0.42 cm(2). LBNP counteracts the headward fluid shift elevation of ICP and IJV CSA experienced during microgravity as simulated by 15 degrees HDT. These data provide quantitative evidence that LBNP shifts cephalic fluid to the lower body, reducing IJV CSA and ICP.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The current study provides new evidence that 25 or 50 mmHg of lower body negative pressure reduces jugular venous pooling and intracranial pressure during simulated microgravity. Therefore, spaceflight countermeasures that sequester fluid to the lower body may mitigate cephalic venous congestion and vision impairment.

TI Spring-assisted cranial vault expansion in the setting of multisutural
   craniosynostosis and anomalous venous drainage: case report
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB Patients with multisutural craniosynostosis can develop anomalous venous connections between the intracranial sinuses and cutaneous venous system through enlarged emissary veins. Cranial vault remodeling in this subset of patients carries the risk of massive intraoperative blood loss and/or occlusion of collateral draining veins leading to intracranial venous hypertension and raised intracranial pressure, increasing the morbidity of cranial expansion. The authors report the use of spring-mediated expansion as a technique for cranial reconstruction in which the collateral intracranial venous drainage system can be preserved.
   A patient with bilateral lambdoid, sagittal, and unicoronal synostosis presented for cranial reconstruction. A tracheostomy and ventriculoperitoneal shunt were placed prior to intervention. At the time of reconstruction, a Luckenschadel skull abnormality and Chiari malformation Type I were present. A preoperative CT venogram demonstrated large collateral superficial occipital veins, small bilateral internal jugular veins, and hypoplastic jugular foramina. Collateral flow from the transverse and sigmoid sinuses through large occipital emissary veins was seen. Spring-mediated cranial vault expansion was performed with care to preserve the large collateral veins at the occiPital midline. Four springs were placed at each lambdoid and the posterior and anterior sagittal sutures following 1-cm strip suturectomies. Removal of the springs was performed 2 months postoperatively.
   Cranial vault expansion was performed without disturbing the aberrant intracranial/extracranial venous collateral system. Estimated blood loss was 150 ml. A CT scan obtained 3 months postoperatively showed resolution of the Luckenschadel deformity and a 40% volumetric increase in the skull compared with the preoperative CT.
   Patients with anomalous venous drainage patterns and multisutural synostosis can undergo spring-mediated cranial vault expansion while preserving the major emissary veins draining the intracranial sinuses. Risks of blood loss, intracranial venous hypertension, and increased intracranial pressure may be decreased compared with traditional techniques of repair.

TI Pulsatile Tinnitus: Differential Diagnosis and Approach to Management
SO CURRENT PAIN AND HEADACHE REPORTS
AB Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this review is to provide an updated approach to the evaluation and management of pulsatile tinnitus (PT), an uncommon but often treatable subtype of tinnitus.Recent FindingsSecondary PT can be due to either vascular or non-vascular etiologies, including, but not limited to: neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation or fistula, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, dural venous sinus stenosis, otoacoustic etiologies (e.g., otosclerosis, patulous eustachian tube) and bony defects (e.g., superior semicircular canal dehiscence). Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging have comparable diagnostic yield, though each may be more sensitive to specific etiologies. If initial vascular imaging is negative and a vascular etiology is strongly suspected, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) may further aid in the diagnosis. Many vascular etiologies of PT can be managed endovascularly, often leading to PT improvement or resolution. Notably, venous sinus stenting is an emerging therapy for PT secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension with venous sinus stenosis.SummaryCareful history and physical exam can help establish the differential diagnosis for PT and guide subsequent evaluation and management. Additional studies on the efficacy and long-term outcome of venous sinus stenting for venous stenosis are warranted.

TI Comparison of microcatheter and pressure wire for venous sinus
   manometric evaluation of patients with idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Background Venous sinus manometry performed by microcatheter to assess candidacy for venous sinus stenting in patients with idiopathic cranial pressure (IIH) can be tiring, time-consuming and unreliable. Pressure wire is widely used to measure coronary pressure and evaluate coronary stenosis severity, but venous sinus manometry using the pressure guide wire has only been reported in one case, and few studies have examined the accuracy of this approach. Objective To compare venous manometry performed by microcatheter with by pressure wire under awake setting in patients with IIH. Methods The manometry results of 30 patients with IIH were recorded by Rebar-27 microcatheter and a pressure wire under awake setting. The mean venous pressures (MVPs) and trans-stenosis pressure gradients were obtained and compared between microcatheter and pressure wire. Paired t-test) were used to evaluate the data between the two groups. Results MVPs in superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and torcula were slightly higher with microcatheter, though without statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). MVPs in transverse sinus (TS) and sigmoid sinus (SS) were significantly higher with microcatheter (p < 0.05). Trans-stenotic pressure gradient with microcatheter was significantly higher than with pressure wire (p>.001). Conclusions Intracranial venous pressure measured with the microcatheter and pressure wire showed a moderate difference. Compared with the traditional microcatheter method?the pressure wire is safe, fast and effective method to identify the patient needing intervention.

TI Endovascular correction of an infantile intracranial venous outflow
   obstruction Case report
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB The authors report on the case of a 7-year-old boy who presented with a reduced level of activity, macrocephaly, prominent scalp veins, and decreased left-sided visual acuity. Imaging workup demonstrated generalized cerebral volume loss, bilateral chronic subdural hematomas, absent left sigmoid sinus, hypoplastic left transverse sinus, and severe focal weblike stenosis of the right sigmoid sinus. Right sigmoid sinus angioplasty and stent insertion was performed, with an immediate reduction in the transduced intracranial venous pressure gradient across the stenosis (from 22 to 3 mm Hg). Postprocedural diminution of prominent scalp and forehead veins and spinal venous collateral vessels was followed by a progressive improvement in visual acuity and physical activity over a 1-year follow-up period, supporting the efficacy of angioplasty and stent insertion in intracranial venous outflow obstruction.
   There are multiple potential causes of intracranial venous hypertension in children. Development of dural sinus stenosis in infancy may be one such cause, mimicking the clinical presentation of other causes such as vein of Galen malformations. This condition can be ameliorated by early endovascular revascularization.

TI Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension Complicated by Subdural Effusions
   Treated by Surgical Relief of Cranial Venous Outflow Obstruction
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY REPORTS
AB Spontaneous intracranial hypotension describes the clinical syndrome brought on by a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Orthostatic headache is the key symptom, but others include nausea, vomiting, and dizziness, as well as cognitive and mood disturbance. In severe cases, the brain slumps inside the cranium and subdural collections develop to replace lost CSF volume. Initial treatment is by bed rest, but when conservative measures fail, attention is focused on finding and plugging the leak, although this can be very difficult and some patients remain bedbound for months or years. Recently, we have proposed an alternative approach in which obstruction to cranial venous outflow would be regarded as the driving force behind a chronic elevation of CSF pressure, which eventually causes dural rupture. Instead of focusing on the site of rupture, therefore, investigation and treatment can be directed at locating and relieving the obstructing venous lesion, allowing intracranial pressure to fall, and the dural defect to heal. The case we describe illustrates this idea. Moreover, since there was a graded clinical response to successive interventions relieving venous obstruction, and eventual complete resolution, it also provides an opportunity to consider particular symptoms in relation to cerebral venous insufficiency in its own right.

TI Jugular venous narrowing and spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid
   leaks: A case-control study exploring association and proposed mechanism
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Background Spontaneous skull base cerebrospinal fluid leaks (CSFLs) are associated with increased intracranial pressure in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and hypothesized to relate to skull base erosions due to increased CSF pressure. Given the increasing recognition of internal jugular venous stenosis (IJVS) as a cause of intracranial hypertension (IH), we evaluated the relationship between spinal CSFL and venous causes of IH. Methods The spinal CSFL database at a single institution was assessed to identify 12 consecutive spontaneous, non-traumatic spinal CSFL patients with CTV data. Exclusion criteria included documented IIH and iatrogenic CSFL. Demographics, clinical parameters, imaging characteristics, and IJV manometry results were recorded. Internal jugular venous stenosis was graded as: none (0-10%), mild (10-50%), moderate (50-80%), severe (>80-99%), and occluded (100%). Twelve consecutive patients who presented with cerebrovascular accidents without CSFL, matched by age and sex, were similarly analyzed as a control group. STROBE guidelines were used in reporting results. Results All CSFL patients had IJVS (83.3% bilateral, 33.3% severe) compared to 41.7% of the control group (33.3% bilateral, 16.7% severe-occluded); p = 0.04. All CSFL patients with available venogram manometry data had at least unilateral IJV gradients. Most patients presented with modified Rankin score (mRS) of 1 (66.7%), but in those with higher mRS, medical and/or surgical interventions were associated with decreased morbidity. Conclusion Spontaneous spinal CSFL was associated with IJVS in patients not meeting IIH criteria. Persistently high CSF pressure resulting in CSFL may cause opening pressure to be falsely normal or low. Internal jugular venous stenosis may be a viable target in recurrent CSFL management and improve morbidity.

TI Styloidogenic Jugular Venous Compression Syndrome: Clinical Features and
   Case Series
SO OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Styloidogenic jugular venous compression syndrome (SJVCS) is a rare cause of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
   OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the pathophysiology and the hemodynamics of SJVCS.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records, clinical images, dynamic venography, and manometry for consecutive patients with SJVCS undergoing microsurgical decompression from April 2009 to October 2017. Patients with IIH with normal venography and manometry findings served as controls.
   RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 10 patients with SJVCS who presented with headaches. Neck flexion exacerbated headaches in 7 patients. Eleven patientswith IIH provided control data for normal intracranial venous pressure and styloid process anatomy. Patients with SJVCS had bilateral osseous compression of venous outflow. The styloid processes were significantly longer in patients with SJVCS than in those with IIH (mean [standard deviation (SD)] distance, 31.0 [10.6] vs 19.0 [14.1] mm; P <.01). The styloid process-C1 lateral tubercle distance was shorter in patients with SJVCS than in those with IIH (mean [SD] distance, 2.9 [1.0] vs 9.9 [2.8] mm; P <.01). Patients with SJVCS had significantly higher global venous pressure and a higher pressure gradient across the stenosis site than controls (mean [SD] pressure, 2.86 [2.61] vs 0.13 [1.09] cm H2O; P =.09). All 10 patients with SJVCS experienced venous pressure elevation during contralateral neck turning (mean [SD] pressure, 4.29 [2.50] cm H2O). All 10 patients with SJVCS underwent transcervical microsurgical decompression, and 9 experienced postoperative improvement or resolution of symptoms. One patient had transient postoperative dysphagia and facial drooping, and another patient reported jaw numbness.
   CONCLUSION: SJVCS is a novel clinical entity causing IIH. Patients should be evaluated with dynamic venography with manometry. Surgical decompression with removal of osseous overgrowth is an effective treatment in select patients.

TI Analysis of cerebral venous sinus stenosis by flat panel angiographic CT
   (FP-CT) to guide treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Introduction Cerebral venous sinus stenting (CVSS) is an effective treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) secondary to dural venous sinus stenosis. Traditional selection of patients for CVSS has been made by microcatheter manometry, but pressure measurements are often equivocal. Here we present the results of a series of cases in which venous flat-panel CT (FP-CT) was used as an adjunct to microcatheter manometry to improve decision making and precise stent placement during CVSS.Methods Ten consecutive patients with IIH underwent angiography with microcatheter manometry and venous FP-CT, with CVSS if indicated by the results. Cross-sectional measurements of the narrowed sinus were obtained on FP-CT before and after stenting. After the procedure, clinical outcomes were tracked. Follow-up with quantitative MRA with sinus flow measurements was also performed, when available.Results There was an exponential correlation between measured pressure gradient and degree of stenosis calculated using venous FP-CT. All patients with both a high degree of stenosis measured by FP-CT and a high pressure gradient across the stenosis showed a clinical benefit from stenting.Conclusions True measurement of the cross-sectional area of the dural sinus, made by venous phase FP-CT, has a high degree of correlation with elevated venous pressure gradient across the point of stenosis. Even in a limited series of cases, we found an exponential decrease in flow with increasing severity of stenosis. Furthermore, patients with both an elevated venous pressure gradient and critical stenosis of the sinus on FP-CT showed symptomatic improvement after stenting.

TI Optimizing the Respiratory Pump: Harnessing Inspiratory Resistance to
   Treat Systemic Hypotension
SO RESPIRATORY CARE
AB We review the physiology and affects of inspiration through a low level of added resistance for the treatment of hypotension. Recent animal and clinical studies demonstrated that one of the body's natural response mechanisms to hypotension is to harness the respiratory pump to increase circulation. That finding is consistent with observations, in the 1960s, about the effect of lowering intrathoracic pressure on key physiological and hemodynamic variables. We describe studies that focused on the fundamental relationship between the generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration through a low level of resistance created by an impedance threshold device and the physiologic sequelae of a respiratory pump. A decrease in intrathoracic pressure during inspiration through a fixed resistance resulting in a pressure difference of 7 cm H2O has multiple physiological benefits, including: enhanced venous return and cardiac stroke volume, lower intracranial pressure, resetting of the cardiac baroreflex, elevated cerebral blood flow oscillations, increased tissue blood flow/pressure gradient, and maintenance of the integrity of the baroreflex-mediated coherence between arterial pressure and sympathetic nerve activity. While breathing has traditionally been thought primarily to provide gas exchange, studies of the mechanisms involved in animals and humans provide the physiological underpinnings for "the other side of breathing": to increase circulation to the heart and brain, especially in the setting of physiological stress. The existing results support the use of the intrathoracic pump to treat clinical conditions associated with hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, hypotension during and after hemodialysis, hemorrhagic shock, heat stroke, septic shock, and cardiac arrest. Harnessing these fundamental mechanisms that control cardiopulmonary physiology provides new opportunities for respiratory therapists and others who have traditionally focused on ventilation to also help treat serious and often life-threatening circulatory disorders.

TI Improvement in venous outflow following superior sagittal sinus
   decompression after a gunshot wound to the head: case report
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB The most commonly described indications for surgical management of closed depressed skull fractures are hematoma evacuation and repair of extensive cosmetic deformity. Venous sinus injury, which occurs in a subset of depressed skull fractures, is not typically listed as an indication for surgical treatment due to the potential for major venous hemorrhage associated with surgery near these structures. However, if patients exhibit signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension and radiographic findings demonstrate sinus compromise, surgical elevation of the depressed skull fragments is indicated. The authors present the case of a 25-year-old woman with a depressed skull fracture secondary to a gunshot wound with symptomatic compromise in venous outflow of the posterior one-third of the superior sagittal sinus. The patient was treated with surgical decompression via bilateral craniectomy along with intracranial pressure lowering medical therapy and had almost full resolution of her presenting symptoms with documented improvement in flow through the superior sagittal sinus. While the use of surgical treatment for these types of injuries is highly debated, the authors demonstrate here that safe, effective surgical management of these patients is possible and that surgical decompression should always be considered in the case of symptomatic venous sinus flow obstruction.

TI Balloon protection of the Labbe vein during venous sinus stenting
SO NEURORADIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Background: Endovascular treatment of dural venous sinus stenosis using auto-expandable stents is progressively becoming a central part in the management of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and pulsatile tinnitus. One potential concern during stenting is impairment of venous outflow in the Labb & eacute; vein, which usually drains in close proximity to the culprit transverse sinus stenosis. Methods: We propose a technique which can counteract venous outflow impairment, consisting of temporary balloon protection of the Labb & eacute; vein during stent deployment. Results: We illustrate the use of this technique in a case of IIH with intrinsic dural sinus stenosis induced by a large arachnoid granulation situated close to the insertion of the Labb & eacute; vein. The stent was deployed under temporary balloon inflation in order to deflect the arachnoid granulation away from the vein ostium. Conclusions: In selected cases of intrinsic stenosis, temporary balloon protection can be used to avoid Labb & eacute; vein flow impairment during venous sinus stenting.

TI Endovascular Treatment of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Secondary
   to Venous Stenosis
SO BRAZILIAN NEUROSURGERY-ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE NEUROCIRURGIA
AB Introduction Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterized by signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Although the role of venous sinus stenosis in the pathophysiology of IIH is controversial, venous angioplasty with stenting has been proven to decrease cerebral venous pressure and intracranial pressure. This study aims to identify and quantify the clinical improvement obtained by patients with IIH, refractory to prior pharmacological treatment, undergoing endovascular venous angioplasty in a neuroendovascular reference service. Methods A retrospective analytical study of 25 cases of IIH with transverse sinus stenosis operated on in a reference service using the endovascular method, in which clinical data from medical records and information about the procedure were analyzed. Results Of the 25 patients, 22 were women, and the mean age was 42 years. All patients were refractory to prior clinical treatment. At the clinical presentation, all had headaches. There were no complications or failures from the procedures performed. In the 30-day evaluation, there was a significant decrease in all the symptoms reported. Conclusion Venous sinus stenting is safe and effective in patients with IIH with transverse sinus stenosis refractory to clinical treatment, with substantial symptomatic improvement and good evolution in the postoperative follow-up period.

TI THE EFFECTS OF PIPECURONIUM BROMIDE ON INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE AND
   CEREBRAL PERFUSION-PRESSURE
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Twenty patients with expansive pathologic intracranial lesions, who were anesthetized with thiopental, nitrous oxide in oxygen, and fentanyl and mechanically ventilated to ensure normocarbia, received pipecuronium bromide 70-mu-g/kg i.v. Intracranial pressure (ICP), heart rate, arterial pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), EKG, and end-tidal CO2 were simultaneously recorded for 5 min before and for 15 min after administration of the muscle relaxant. No statistically significant changes in ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure were observed after administration of pipecuronium bromide. Cardiovascular stability was maintained during the study period except for a small, although significant, decrease of the CVP from 5.7 +/- 2.5 (SEM) to 5.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg. These results, together with the long-lasting muscular effect of pipecuronium bromide, suggest that this new neuromuscular blocking agent may be used for muscle relaxation during neurosurgical operations in patients who have normal intracranial pressure at the time of administration of the drug.

TI Styloidogenic Jugular Venous Compression Syndrome: Diagnosis and
   Treatment: Case Report
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Intracranial venous hypertension is known to be associated with venous outflow obstruction. We discuss the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical venous outflow obstruction causing pseudotumor cerebri.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report 2 patients presenting with central venous outflow obstruction secondary to osseous compression of the internal jugular veins at the craniocervical junction. The point of jugular compression was between the lateral tubercle of C1 and a prominent, posteriorly located styloid process. In both cases, catheter venography showed high-grade jugular stenosis at the level of C1 with an associated pressure gradient. The dominant jugular vein was decompressed after the styloid process was resected. Postoperative imaging confirmed resolution of the jugular stenosis and normalization of preoperative pressure gradients. In both cases, the symptoms of intracranial hypertension resolved.
   CONCLUSION: Intracranial venous hypertension may result from extrinsic osseous compression of the jugular veins at the skull base. Although rare, this phenomenon is important to recognize because primary stenting not only is ineffective but also may actually exacerbate the outflow obstruction. The osseous impingement of the dominant jugular vein can be relieved via a decompressive styloidectomy, and the clinical results can be excellent.

TI Superior vena cava syndrome: Cause of secondary raise of intracranial
   pressure after traumatic brain injury
SO ANNALES FRANCAISES D ANESTHESIE ET DE REANIMATION
AB A 41-year-old male is admitted for cranial trauma, having fallen from his own height. His state of extreme agitation imposes sedation, intubation and mechanical ventilation. A CT-scan reveals acute right hemispheric subdural haematoma, with discrete midline shift, and diffuse cerebral oedema. ICP-monitoring reveals severely increased intracranial pressure, which is responsive to routine medical neuroprotective treatment. Ten days after admission, sedation and neuroprotective treatment is gradually withdrawn. At the end of the second week, a secondary ascent in ICP is observed. The presence of a right subclavian central venous line, in combination with the strong inflammatory response and septic state of the patient, has caused bilateral thrombosis of subclavian and internal jugular veins. This superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) impedes cerebral venous drainage, thus raising ICP. Within a few days of anticoagulant therapy. SVCS resolved. Impeded cerebral venous drainage is often forgotten or ignored as a cause of secondary elevated ICP. In face of persisting or recurring raises! ICP and cerebral oedema, or apparition of communicant hydrocephalus, cerebral venous drainage should be investigated. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Use of the intrathoracic pressure regulator to lower intracranial
   pressure in patients with altered intracranial elastance: a pilot study
   Clinical article
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Object. The intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR) is a novel noninvasive device designed to increase circulation and blood pressure. By applying negative pressure during the expiratory phase of ventilation it decreases intrathoracic pressure and enhances venous return, which increases cardiac output. It is possible that the ITPR may both decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) and increase cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in brain-injured patients by decreasing cerebral venous blood volume and increasing cardiac output. The authors conducted an open-label, "first-in-humans" study of the ITPR in patients with an ICP monitor or external ventricular drain and altered intracranial elastance.
   Methods. This prospective randomized trial commenced July 2009. Baseline hemodynamic variables and ICP were recorded prior to inserting one of the two ITPRs into the ventilator circuit based on a randomization scheme. Depending on the device selected, activation provided either -5 or -9 mm Hg endotracheal tube pressure. Hemodynamic and ICP data were recorded sequentially every 2 minutes for 10 minutes. The first device was turned off for 10 minutes, then it was removed and the second device was applied, and then the procedure was repeated for the second device.
   Results. Ten patients with elevated ICP secondary to intracranial hemorrhage (n = 4), trauma (n = 2), obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 2), or diffuse cerebral processes (n = 2) were enrolled. Baseline ICP ranged from 12 to 38 mm Hg. With device application, a decrease in ICP was observed in 16 of 20 applications. During treatment with the 5 mm Hg device, there was a mean maximal decrease of 3.3 mm Hg in ICP (21.7 vs 18.4 mm Hg, p = 0.003), which was associated with an increase in CPP of 6.5 mm Hg (58.2 vs 64.7 mm Hg, p = 0.019). During treatment with the 9 mm Hg device, there was a mean maximal decrease of 2.4 mm Hg in ICP (21.1 vs 18.7 mm Hg, p = 0.044), which was associated with an increase in CPP of 6.5 mm Hg (59.2 vs 65.7 mm Hg, p = 0.001).
   Conclusions. This pilot study demonstrates that use of the ITPR in patients with altered intracranial elastance is feasible. Although this study was not powered to demonstrate efficacy, these data strongly suggest that the ITPR may be used to rapidly lower ICP and increase CPP without apparent adverse effects. Additional studies will be needed to assess longitudinal changes in ICP when the device is in use and to delineate treatment parameters.

TI Current understanding of the effects of inspiratory resistance on the
   interactions between systemic blood pressure, cerebral perfusion,
   intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Negative intrathoracic pressure (nITP) is generated by the respiratory muscles during inspiration to overcome inspiratory resistance, thus enabling lung ventilation. Recently developed noninvasive techniques have made it possible to assess the effects of nITP in real time in several physiological aspects such as systemic blood pressure (BP), intracranial pressure (ICP). and cerebral blood flow (CBF). It has been shown that nITP from 0 to -20 cmH(2)O elevates BP and diminishes ICP, which facilitates brain perfusion. The effects of nITP from -20 to -40 cmH(2)O on BP, ICP, and CBF remain largely unrecognized, yet even nITP at -40 cmH(2)O may facilitate CBF by diminishing ICP. Importantly, nITP from -20 to -40 cmH(2)O has been documented in adults in commonly encountered obstructive sleep apnea, which justifies research in this area. Recent revelations about interactions between ICP and BP have opened up new fields of research in physiological regulation and the pathophysiology of common diseases, such as hypertension, brain injury, and respiratory disorders. A better understanding of these interactions may translate directly into new therapies in various fields of clinical medicine.

These include (1) the primary pathogenetic role of an excessive dural sinus collapsibility in IIH, allowing a new relatively stable intracranial fluids pressure balance at higher values; (2) the non-mandatory role of papilledema for a definite diagnosis; (3) the possibly much higher prevalence of IIH without papilledema than currently considered; (4) the crucial role of the cerebral compliance exhaustion that precede the raise in intracranial pressure andthat may already be pathologic in cases showing a moderately elevated opening pressure; (5) the role as intracranial pressure sensor played by the trigeminovascular innervation of dural sinuses and cortical bridge veins, which could represent a major source of CGRP and may explain the high comorbidity and the emerging causative link between IIHWOP and chronic migraine (CM). Accordingly, the control of intracranial pressure is to be considered a promising new therapeutic target in CM.

TI Decompressive Laparotomy for Refractory Intracranial Hypertension After
   Traumatic Brain Injury
SO NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB Intracranial hypertension is a crucial modifiable risk factor for poor outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Limited evidence suggests that decompressive laparotomy may be an effective treatment for refractory ICH in patients who have elevated intra-abdominal pressure.
   Case report.
   We present a multi-trauma patient who sustained severe TBI in a motor vehicle collision. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was initially medically managed but became refractory to standard therapies. Emergent decompressive laparotomy performed in the surgical intensive care unit for abdominal compartment syndrome concomitantly improved the patient's ICP.
   Elevated intra-abdominal pressure can exacerbate intracranial hypertension in patients with TBI. Recognition of this condition and treatment with decompressive laparotomy may be useful in patients with intracranial hypertension refractory to optimal medical therapy.

AB Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) exerts effects not only on intra-abdominal organs, but also on organs distant to the abdominal compartment. Abdomino-thoracic interaction during intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) interferes with pulmonary, cardiovascular and cerebral function.. In accordance with recent guidelines, IAH is defined as IAP above 12 mmHg and ACS as IAP more than 20 mmHg with one or more new organ failures. In this review we will first discuss the effects of elevated IAP on pulmonary dynamics and the relevance for interpreting airway pressures and adjusting ventitator settings. We will then discuss the interaction between abdomino-thoracic pressure transmission and global haemodynamics, the knowledge of which is necessary for correct assessment of cardiac preload and to optimize fluid therapy in the setting of IAH/ACS.
   A discussion on the relationship between increased IAP, increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) will follow. Finally, we will review ventilator-induced thoracic pressure swings and their transmission to the abdominal compartment.

It is an anomaly that occurs most often in children, with a high mortality due to the accompanying severe cardiac failure. Spontaneous thrombosis of vein of Galen malformation is rare. There are several proposed mechanisms of spontaneous thrombosis notable ones being slow flow shunts and severe obstruction of the venous outflow. The absence of blood flow at the deep cerebral venous system due to malformation thrombosis, along with absence of signs or symptoms of intracranial hypertension led us to conservative treatment of the patient presented here.

TI Mechanisms of inspiration that modulate cardiovascular control: the
   other side of breathing
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB The objective of this minireview is to describe the physiology and potential clinical benefits derived from inspiration. Recent animal and clinical studies demonstrate that one of the body's natural mechanisms associated with inspiration is to harness the respiratory pump to enhance circulation to vital organs. There is evidence that large reductions in intrathoracic pressure (>20 cmH(2)O) caused by some inspiration maneuvers (e.g., Mueller maneuver) or pathophysiology (e.g., heart failure, chronic obstructive lung disease) can result in adverse hemodynamic effects. However, the respiratory pump can improve cardiovascular functions when a "sweet spot" for generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration can be maintained at or less than 10 cmH(2)O below normal inspiration. These beneficial physiological effects include greater cardiac filling and output, lower intracranial pressure, cardiac baroreflex resetting, greater cerebral blood flow oscillatory patterns. increased vascular pressure gradients, and promoting sustained feedback between sympathetic nerve activity and arterial pressure. In addition to promoting gas exchange, data obtained from numerous animal and human experiments have provided new insights into "the other side of breathing": the modulation of circulation by reduced intrathoracic pressure generated during inspiration. The translation of these physiological relationships form the basis for the development and application of technologies designed to optimize the intrathoracic pump for treatment of clinical conditions associated with hypovolemia including cardiac arrest, orthostatic hypotension, hemorrhagic shock, and traumatic brain injury. Harnessing these fundamental mechanisms that control cardiopulmonary physiology provides opportunities to use inspiration as a potential tool to help treat significant and often life-threatening circulatory disorders.

TI Outcomes of Pulsatile Tinnitus After Cerebral Venous Sinus Stenting:
   Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis of 616 Patients
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is a debilitating condition with substantial morbidity related to quality of life. Cerebral venous sinus stenosis has recently emerged as a noninfrequent cause of PT, either in the setting of concurrent idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or due to primary venous stenosis. Venous sinus stenting (VSS) is an endovascular technique that can be used to treat venous stenosis. However, it is unclear if outcomes are different between patients with primary venogenic PT and IIH associated PT. METHODS: A systematic literature review and pooled analysis was completed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of PT in patients undergoing cerebral VSS. Outcome measures included: Improved PT, complete resolution of PT, and PT recurrence at follow-up. Subgroup analysis between patients with IIH and primary PT was completed. RESULTS: In total, 28 studies were identified with 616 patients. The proportion of improved PT symptoms after VSS had an overall pooled rate of 91.7% (confidence interval [CI]:88.1%-95.2%; I-2 = 65%) and no difference between subgroups (P = 0.12). Complete resolution after VSS had an overall pooled rate of 88.6% (CI: 84.0%-93.3%; I-2 = 68%) and no significant difference between subgroups (P P = 0.35). Recurrent PT after stenting occurred in 6.5% of cases (CI: 1.7%-11.3%; I-2 = 62%). Furthermore, subgroup analysis demonstrated that IIH patients had a significantly higher recurrence rate (10.6%; CI: 5.2%-16.1%; I-2 = 26%) compared to patients treated with venous stenting for PT as the primary indication (2.0%; CI: 0.8%-4.7%; I-2 = 0%) (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Venous stenting in patients with PT results in a substantial decrease and often complete resolution of symptoms. PT is more likely to recur in patients with IIH-associated PT.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension imaging approaches and the
   implications in patient management
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) represents a clinical disease entity without a clear etiology, that if left untreated, can result in severe outcomes, including permanent vision loss. For this reason, early diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Historically, the role of cross-sectional imaging has been to rule out secondary or emergent causes of increased intracranial pressure, including tumor, infection, hydrocephalus, or venous thrombosis. MRI and MRV, however, can serve as valuable imaging tools to not only rule out causes for secondary intracranial hypertension but can also detect indirect signs of IIH resultant from increased intracranial pressure, and demonstrate potentially treatable sinus venous stenosis. Digital subtraction venographic imaging also plays a central role in both diagnosis and treatment, providing enhanced anatomic delineation and temporal flow evaluation, quantitative assessment of the pressure gradient across a venous stenosis, treatment guidance, and immediate opportunity for endovascular therapy. In this review, we discuss the multiple modalities for imaging IIH, their limitations, and their contributions to the management of IIH.

TI Skeletal Muscle Relaxants and Their Impact on Intracranial Pressure in
   Neurosurgery
SO MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR BASIC RESEARCH
AB Skeletal muscle relaxants have their place in everyday use in numerous anesthesiological procedures, such as preparing a patient for surgery, supporting mechanical ventilation, and performing effective intubation. These drugs can be divided, based on their mechanism of action, into depolarizing skeletal relaxants, such as succinylcholine, and non-depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants. Non-depolarizing agents are further categorized, based on their structure, into steroidal (eg, rocuronium) and benzylisoquinoline (eg, atracurium) compounds. To gain better control over neuromuscular blockade and patient recovery, a group of drugs known as reversal agents was developed. The effectiveness of skeletal muscle relaxants can be influenced by factors such as acid-base imbalances, impaired metabolism, and excretion, due to kidney or liver dysfunction, age, and sex. Skeletal muscle relaxants have also been used in neurosurgical procedures. It is believed that these drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier. By reducing intrathoracic pressure and central venous pressure, they can lower intracranial pressure. However, in some studies, an increase in intracranial pressure has been observed. Therefore, selecting the appropriate drug is crucial, particularly for patients with suspected or confirmed elevated intracranial pressure, which is defined as the pressure within the intracranial space relative to atmospheric pressure. Elevated intracranial pressure above normal levels can occur in various conditions, such as sinus thrombosis, aneurysm rupture, brain tumors, intraventricular hemorrhage, and meningitis. In this article, we aim to review the role of muscle relaxants and reversal agents in neurosurgical procedures.

TI Hypothesis: Preeclampsia is a venous disease secondary to an increased
   intra-abdominal pressure
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB It is hypothesized that in some women an excessively high intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) compresses the inferior vena cava, uterine veins, portal vein, hepatic veins, splenic vein and renal veins which lead to a decreased flow in these vascular beds, producing lower extremity edema, fetal-placental ischemia, a glomerulopathy with proteinuria and hypertension, hepatic ischemia and thrombocytopenia, increased uric acid, and hemolysis/elevated liver enzymes/low platelet known as the HELLP syndrome. There can be variability in the expression of these components. Placental-fetal ischemia could lead to expression of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase1 (sFLT) and endoglin which have been shown to cause additional diffuse endovascular damage. A further increase in IAP pushes the diaphragm cephalad, increasing intrathoracic pressure leading to upper extremity edema, decreased internal jugular venous flow, cerebral vascular engorgement, raised intracranial pressure, and if unresolved, seizures. Placental/fetal ischemia and hepatic ischemic necrosis may lead to diffuse inflammation and a septic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which may become a vicious cycle, perpetuating the ischemia. It is further hypothesized that application of an externally applied negative abdominal pressure device will lower IAP and possibly reverse the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. As the abnormal placental proteins develop weeks before clinical preeclampsia, early application of external negative abdominal pressure may prevent development of the syndrome.

TI Endovascular stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension with
   venous sinus stenosis
SO BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
AB Objectives: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by elevated intracranial pressure of unknown etiology and venous sinus stenting may be an optional treatment. We aimed to evaluate the effects of venous sinus stenting on visual function, intracranial pressure, and trans-stenotic pressure gradient of the patients with IIH and to determine effects of baseline BMI or weight changes on subjective vision outcome and intracranial pressure.
   Methods: From July 2009 to Aug 2016, 88 eligible patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis who underwent stenting were retrospectively studied.
   Results: In this study, 67 women and 21 men were included with an average age of 39.01 (18-60) years. The average BMI was 26.75 kg/m2. Here, 66 (75.9%) patients had papilledema, 39 had impaired vision before stenting; 57 patients were followedup, 48 (84.2%) showed significant subjective improvement or recovery in visual acuity, 4 (7.0%) patients reported no significant change in visual functions, and 5 (8.8%) suffered permanent vision loss. The cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure and transstenotic pressure gradient were significantly decreased postoperatively. Baseline BMI was associated with pre-and postoperative trans-stenotic pressure gradients, as well as changes in cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure. However, baseline BMI and body weight changes during follow-up were not necessarily associated with subjective visual outcomes after stenting. Stenting efficacy was limited in patients with severe preoperative optic symptoms.
   Conclusions: Venous sinus stenting represented an effective treatment for resolving visual dysfunction and intracranial pressure associated with venous sinus stenosis. BMI seemed to be associated with intracranial pressure but not subjective visual outcomes after stenting.

SO ANNALS OF CLINICAL RESEARCH
AB Patients (3) with head injuries developed minor facial twitching while their intracranial, intrathoracic and systemic arterial pressures were being monitored and they were on mechanical ventilation. These twitches were disclosed by the coincided great and damaging increases in the intracranial pressure, while the intrathoracic and arterial pressures were virtually unchanged. The intracranial hypertension was attributed to cerebral vasodilatation which was presumed to be due to the accumulation of cerebral metabolites since other causative factors such as systemic hypertension and hypoxia were under control.

TI The Headache of High Altitude and Microgravity-Similarities with
   Clinical Syndromes of Cerebral Venous Hypertension
SO HIGH ALTITUDE MEDICINE & BIOLOGY
AB Wilson, Mark H., C. H. E. Imray, A. R. Hargens. The headache of high altitude and microgravity-similarities with clinical syndromes of cerebral venous hypertension. High Alt. Med. Biol. 12: 379-386.-Syndromes thought to have cerebral venous hypertension as their core, such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension and jugular foramen outlet obstruction, classically result in headaches. Do they provide an insight into the cause of the headache that commonly occurs at altitude? The classic theory of the pathogenesis of high altitude headache has been that it results from increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to hypoxemia in people who have less compliant intracranial volumes (Roach and Hackett, 2001). However, there does not appear to be a correlation between the headache of acute mountain sickness (AMS) and the presence of cerebral edema (Bailey et al, 2006; Wilson et al, 2009). Research has concentrated on arterial perfusion to the brain in hypoxia, but there has been little study of venous drainage. Hypoxia results in markedly increased cerebral blood flow; however, if it has been considered at all, venous outflow has to date been assumed to be of little consequence. Retinal venous distension and the increased venous blood demonstrated by near infra-red spectroscopy and more recently by MRI imply that, in hypoxia, a relative venous insufficiency may exist. Similarly, there is increasing evidence that manifestations of the fluid shift during microgravity is of similar nature to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which is thought to be primarily a venous insufficiency condition. The unique anthropomorphic adaptations of large brained biped humans with cerebral venous systems that have to cope with large changes in hydrostatic pressure may predispose us to conditions of inflow/outflow mismatch. In addition, slight increases in central venous pressures (e. g., from hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction) may further compromise venous outflow at altitude. A better understanding of cerebral venous physiology may enlighten us with regards the pathogenesis of headaches currently considered idiopathic. It may also enable us to trigger headaches for study and hence enable us to develop new treatment strategies.

TI Venous sinus stenting shortens the duration of medical therapy for
   increased intracranial pressure secondary to venous sinus stenosis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Introduction Medical treatment, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting, and optic nerve sheath fenestration are standard treatments for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Venous sinus stenting provides a novel alternative surgical treatment in cases of venous sinus stenosis with elevated ICP.
   Methods 12 consecutive subjects with papilledema, increased ICP, and radiological signs of dural sinus stenosis underwent cerebral venography and manometry. All subjects had papilledema and demonstrated radiological evidence of dural venous sinus stenosis.
   Results Six subjects chose venous stenting (Group A) and six declined and were managed conservatively with oral acetazolamide (Group B). The relative pressure gradient across the venous narrowing was 2916.3mmHg in Group A and 17.6 +/- 9.3mmHg in Group B (p=0.09). The mean lumbar puncture opening pressure was 40.4 +/- 7.6cmH(2)O in Group A and 35.6 +/- 10.6cmH(2)O in Group B (p=0.4). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed mean average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness of 210 +/- 44.8 mu m in Group A and 235 +/- 124.7 mu m in Group B. However, the mean average RNFL thickness at 6months was 85 +/- 9 mu m in Group A and 95 +/- 24 mu m in Group B (p=0.6). The total duration of acetazolamide treatment was 188 +/- 209days in Group A compared with 571 +/- 544days in Group B (p=0.07).
   Conclusions In subjects with venous sinuses stenosis, endovascular stenting offers an effective treatment option for intracranial hypertension which may shorten the duration of medical therapy.

TI Foundations of the Diagnosis and Management of Idiopathic Intracranial
   Hypertension and Pulsatile Tinnitus
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB Venous sinus stenosis has garnered increasing academic attention as a potential etiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The complex anatomy of the cerebral venous sinuses and veins plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of these conditions. Venous sinus stenosis, often found in the superior sagittal or transverse sinus, can lead to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and characteristic IIH symptoms. Stenosis, variations in dural venous anatomy, and flow dominance patterns contribute to aberrant flow and subsequent PT. Accurate imaging plays a vital role in diagnosis, and magnetic resonance (MR) venography is particularly useful for detecting stenosis. Management strategies for IIH and PT focus on treating the underlying disease, weight management, medical interventions, and, in severe cases, surgical or endovascular procedures. Recently, venous sinus stenting has gained interest as a minimally invasive treatment option for IIH and PT. Stenting addresses venous sinus stenosis, breaking the feedback loop between elevated ICP and stenosis, thus reducing ICP and promoting cerebrospinal fluid outflow. The correction and resolution of flow aberrances can also mitigate or resolve PT symptoms. While venous sinus stenting remains an emerging field, initial results are promising. Further research is needed to refine patient selection criteria and evaluate the long-term efficacy of stenting as compared to traditional treatments.

TI Abdominal compartment syndrome
SO ACTA CHIRURGICA BELGICA
AB Abdominal compartment syndrome may be defined as the deleterious pathophysiologic consequences of a significant increase in intra-abdominal pressure. These alterations can affect respiratory mechanics, cardiovascular system, regional blood flow, renal function, urine output, and intracranial pressure. Although the syndrome may be associated with many clinical situations, the most common are severe abdominal trauma and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Diagnosis depends upon recognition of the clinical syndrome followed by an objective measurement of intraabdominal pressure, the most common being the measurement of bladder pressure. Treatment consists of adequate fluid resuscitation and surgical decompression when necessary.

TI Remodeling of venous drainage after the treatment of dural sinus
   malformation with arteriovenous shunts in a neonate: a case report and
   literature review
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Dural sinus malformations (DSMs) are rare congenital vascular diseases characterized by a giant venous pouch with or without arteriovenous shunts. We present a neonatal case of DSM that was diagnosed prenatally and treated via endovascular intervention in the early postnatal period. The patient presented with a large DSM involving the torcular Herophilion prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Enlargement of the head circumference and respiratory failure rapidly progressed after birth. On the 5th day after birth, the neonate underwent endovascular occlusion via the umbilical artery. The arteriovenous shunt was occluded, and the reflux from the enlarged venous pouch to the dural sinus was decreased. No additional procedure other than ventriculoperitoneal shunting was required. The neonate's development slowly caught up to normal parameters. Follow-up MRI demonstrated the successful development of the venous drainage system. DSMs are characterized by an abnormally dilated dural sinus, which can block the venous return and ultimately increase intracranial pressure and cerebral ischemia. Long-term follow-up indicates that an abnormally developed dural sinus can be reconstructed by appropriate and timely treatment.

TI SEVOFLURANE DOES NOT INCREASE INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE IN HYPERVENTILATED
   DOGS
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
AB We have measured the effects of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane on intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure and heart rate in hypocapnic dogs (Pa(CO2) 3.2-3.7 kPa) and compared the data with those produced by equi-MAC concentrations of enflurane and halothane. Enflurane and halothane caused small but significant increases in ICP at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 MAC, but there were no changes with sevoflurane. However, sevoflurane caused a considerable decrease in MAP with consequent decrease in CPP. We conclude that sevoflurane should be a suitable agent for neuroanaesthesia and is preferable to either enflurane or halothane.

TI Understanding the complex pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension and the evolving role of venous sinus stenting: a
   comprehensive review of the literature
SO NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease defined by elevated intracranial pressure without established etiology. Although there is now consensus on the definition of the disorder, its complex pathophysiology remains elusive. The most common clinical symptoms of IIH include headache and visual complaints. Many current theories regarding the etiology of IIH focus on increased secretion or decreased absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and on cerebral venous outflow obstruction due to venous sinus stenosis. In addition, it has been postulated that obesity plays a role, given its prevalence in this population of patients. Several treatments, including optic nerve sheath fenestration, CSF diversion with ventriculoperitoneal or lumboperitoneal shunts, and more recently venous sinus stenting, have been described for medically refractory IIH. Despite the availability of these treatments, no guidelines or standard management algorithms exist for the treatment of this disorder. In this paper, the authors provide a review of the literature on IIH, its clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and evidence supporting treatment strategies, with a specific focus on the role of venous sinus stenting.

TI Acute cerebral venous outflow obstruction during convexity meningioma
   resection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Background Cerebral venous outflow obstruction involves idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and the most common related condition is dural venous sinus stenosis or, in other words, an obstruction of the dural venous sinuses. In these cases, the pathological process is often chronic, displays only mild symptoms, and rarely requires urgent surgical intervention. In this study, we present a unique case involving an acute cerebral venous outflow obstruction that occurred during meningioma resection that ultimately had catastrophic consequences. Materials and methods The patient's preoperative imaging only revealed an unremarkable frontal convexity meningioma with an average diameter exceeding 8 cm. She was admitted for a scheduled right frontoparietal craniotomy for lesion resection. Results The patient's unique congenital dural venous sinus structure along with a non-surgical epidural hematoma both contributed to a catastrophic outcome, causing a progressive hemispheric encephalocele, significant blood loss, and wound closure difficulties. Conclusion Neurosurgeons should place an additional focus on cerebral venous outflow patency during tumor resection, even if the tumor does not involve the transverse or sigmoid sinuses. It is well known that the tacking sutures play an essential role in preventing an epidural hematoma, but the procedure to mitigate hematomas occurring outside the surgical field of view is not fully recognized by neurosurgeons. If dural tacking sutures are placed after complete tumor resection, the prophylactic effect for preventing EDH in the non-surgical areas may not be guaranteed. Therefore, we strongly advocate for the tacking sutures to be accurately placed before dural incisions are made.

TI Effect of venous stenting on intracranial pressure in idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Background Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterised by an increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of any central nervous system disease or structural abnormality and by normal CSF composition. Management becomes complicated once surgical intervention is required. Venous sinus stenosis has been suggested as a possible aetiology for IIH. Venous sinus stenting has emerged as a possible interventional option. Evidence for venous sinus stenting is based on elimination of the venous pressure gradient and clinical response. There have been no studies demonstrating the immediate effect of venous stenting on ICP.
   Methods Patients with a potential or already known diagnosis of IIH were investigated according to departmental protocol. ICP monitoring was performed for 24 h. When high pressures were confirmed, CT venogram and catheter venography were performed to look for venous stenosis to demonstrate a pressure gradient. If positive, venous stenting would be performed and ICP monitoring would continue for a further 24 h after deployment of the venous stent.
   Results Ten patients underwent venous sinus stenting with concomitant ICP monitoring. Nine out of ten patients displayed an immediate reduction in their ICP that was maintained at 24 h. The average reduction in mean ICP and pulsatility was significant (p = 0.003). Six out of ten patients reported a symptomatic improvement within the first 2 weeks.
   Conclusions Venous sinus stenting results in an immediate reduction in ICP. This physiological response to venous stenting has not previously been reported. Venous stenting could offer an alternative treatment option in correctly selected patients with IIH.

AB Background: To determine the ability of an externally applied continuous negative abdominal pressure device (CNAP) to reverse the effects of elevated intra-abdominal pressure on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems.
   Methods: Anesthetized, ventilated swine had catheters placed for measurement of intra-abdominal (IAP), intracranial (ICP), central venous, pulmonary artery, pulmonary artery occlusion, mean arterial, peak inspiratory, inferior vena cava, and femoral vein pressures. After the animals stabilized, baseline measurements were obtained. IAP was increased by incrementally in stilling an isosmotic polyethylene glycol solution into the peritoneal cavity until it was 25 mm Hg above baseline. IAP mas maintained at 25 mm Hg above baseline for 2 hours. CNAP was then applied for 2 hours. All parameters were remeasured 30 minutes after each increase in WP, at 2 hours after attaining maximum IAP, and lastly at 2 hours after abdominal decompression. Cardiac index was maintained near baseline by volume expansion.
   Results: Elevation of WP to 25 mm Hg above baseline for 2 hours caused increases (p < 0.05) in central venous pressure (10.3 +/- 0.9 to 15.2 +/- 1.7), inferior vena cava pressure (13.0 +/- 1.0 to 29.5 +/- 1.5), femoral vein pressure (13.5 +/- 0.5 to 33.3 +/- 1.3), ICP (10.6 +/- 1.5 to 21.0 +/- 1.5), and peak inspiratory pressure (18.3 +/- 0.3 to 34.2 +/- 1.0). The mean arterial pressure (106.3 +/- 3.5 to 125.8 +/- 3.4), pulmonary artery pressure (24.3 +/- 2.3 to 31.3 +/- 1.7), and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure rose (12.3 +/- 0.9 to 17.5 +/- 3.5), but not significantly. Cardiac index (3.3 +/- 0.5 to 3.4 +/- 0.4) remained essentially unchanged. CNAP significantly (p < 0.05) decreased IAP (30.7 +/- 1.3 to 18.2 +/- 1.3), central venous pressure (15.2 +/- 1.7 to 12.4 +/- 2.1), inferior vena cava (29.5 +/- 1.5 to 19.2 +/- 1.3), and ICP (21.0 +/- 1.5 to 16.2 +/- 1.3). Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (17.5 +/- 3.5 to 15.0 +/- 3.1) and peak inspiratory pressure (34.2 +/- 1.0 to 29.7 +/- 1.1) decreased, but not significantly.
   Conclusion: Acutely elevated IAP causes a significant increase in ICP and impaired cardiovascular and pulmonary function, Abdominal decompression remains the standard of care for abdominal compartment syndrome. However, in patients in whom an increased WP does not require surgical decompression, the results of this study suggest that externally applied CNAP may be of value.

TI Safety of flow-controlled ventilation with positive and negative
   end-expiratory pressure in a swine model of intracranial hypertension
SO INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE EXPERIMENTAL
AB Background Patients with brain damage often require mechanical ventilation. Although lung-protective ventilation is recommended, the application of increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to altered cerebral venous return. This study investigates the effects of flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) using negative end-expiratory pressures (NEEP), on cerebral hemodynamics in a swine model of intracranial hypertension. Methods A model of intracranial hypertension involving bilateral trepan bolt holes was performed in 14 pigs. Pressure-controlled volume-guaranteed ventilation (PCV-VG) with PEEP and FCV using PEEP and then NEEP were applied. Intracranial pressure and oxygenation, as well as systemic hemodynamics and gas exchange parameters, were continuously monitored. Data were collected at baseline and at varying PEEP levels for both PCV-VG and FCV ventilation modalities. Following this, FCV ventilation and NEEP levels of -3, -6 and -9 cmH(2)O were applied. Results ICP remained stable with low PEEP levels, but significantly decreased with NEEP. Lower ICP following NEEP improved cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral tissue oxygenation (p < 0.05 for all). FCV with NEEP at EEP-6 and EEP-9 significantly improved cardiac output and mean arterial pressure (MAP), compared to PCV-VG and FCV using PEEP (p < 0.05, respectively). There were no significant differences in gas exchange parameters between modalities (PCV-VG vs FCV), and between the application of PEEP or NEEP. No significant correlations were observed between Delta ICP and Delta MAP. Conclusion The application of FCV with NEEP appears to be a safe ventilation mode and offers an additional tool for controlling severe intracranial pressure episodes. These findings warrant validation in future studies and may lead to important potential applications in clinical practice.

TI Evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety of cervical trauma collars:
   differences in immobilization, effect on jugular venous pressure and
   patient comfort
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB Background: Concern has been raised that cervical collars may increase intracranial pressure in traumatic brain injury. The purpose of this study was to compare four types of cervical collars regarding efficacy of immobilizing the neck, effect on jugular venous pressure (JVP), as a surrogate for possible effect on intracranial pressure, and patient comfort in healthy volunteers.
   Methods: The characteristics of four widely used cervical collars (Laerdal Stifneck (R) (SN), Vista (R) (VI), Miami J Advanced (R) (MJ), Philadelphia (R) (PH)) were studied in ten volunteers. Neck movement was measured with goniometry, JVP was measured directly through an endovascular catheter and participants graded the collars according to comfort on a scale 1-5.
   Results: The mean age of participants was 27 +/- 5 yr and BMI 26 +/- 5. The mean neck movement (53 +/- 9 degrees) decreased significantly with all the collars (p < 0.001) from 18 +/- 7 degrees to 25 +/- 9 degrees (SN < MJ < PH < VI). There was a significant increase in mean JVP (9.4 +/- 1.4 mmHg) with three of the collars, but not with SN, from 10.5 +/- 2.1 mmHg to 16.3 +/- 3.3 mmHg (SN < MJ < VI < PH). The grade of comfort between collars varied from 4.2 +/- 0.8 to 2.2 +/- 0.8 (VI > MJ > SN > PH).
   Conclusion: Stifneck and Miami J collars offered the most efficient immobilization of the neck with the least effect on JVP. Vista and Miami J were the most comfortable ones. The methodology used in this study may offer a new approach to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of neck collars and aid their continued development.

   the Evaluation of Pulsatile Tinnitus
SO STROKE-VASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL NEUROLOGY
AB Objective Pulsatile tinnitus can be significantly functionally debilitating, with venous sinus stenosis being a largely underrecognized etiology. Establishing a direct cause-effect relationship can be particularly challenging in pulsatile tinnitus cases without idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and with multifocal, bilateral venous sinus stenoses.Case Presentation Herein, we present a patient with pulsatile tinnitus and bilateral transverse-sigmoid sinus stenoses on diagnostic angiogram. Temporary stenting using a Tigertreiver was utilized to localize the symptomatic segment. Patient reported resolution of pulsatile tinnitus after deploying the temporary stentriever within the left sigmoid sinus. Subsequently, permanent stenting of the left sigmoid sinus was preformed resulting in complete resolution of symptoms.Conclusion We highlight the diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with pulsatile tinnitus and venous sinus stenoses, without idiopathic intracranial hypertension. While more experience is needed, temporary stenting may provide an improved method for assessing venous stenting efficacy in patients with pulsatile tinnitus.

TI Venous Manometry as an Adjunct for Diagnosis and Multimodal Management
   of Intracranial Hypertension due to Meningioma Compressing Sigmoid Sinus
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Intracranial venous hypertension is a rare presentation of meningiomas in the transverse-sigmoid sinus region. We describe a case of a young patient presenting with intracranial hypertension due to a meningioma causing compression of the dominant sigmoid sinus. We were able to document the cerebral venous pressure gradient across the lesion confirming our hypothesis that compression of the sigmoid sinus from the meningioma was the cause of intracranial hypertension.
   The patient is a 17-year-old male who presented with intracranial hypertension due to meningioma at the right dominant sigmoid sinus, which was treated by a Simpson grade IV surgical resection followed by stereotactic radiosurgery. Following treatment, his papilledema resolved and he remains symptom-free at 18 months.
   In conclusion, venous manometry is a useful adjunct to diagnose intracranial hypertension in non-idiopathic causes of intracranial hypertension. A multimodal management approach of intracranial hypertension due to outflow obstruction from the dominant sinus led to an excellent recovery on follow up.

TI Is foramen magnum decompression for acquired Chiari I malformation like
   putting a finger in the dyke? - A simplistic overview of artificial
   intelligence in assessing critical upstream and downstream etiologies
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOVERTEBRAL JUNCTION AND SPINE
AB Background: Missed diagnosis of evolving or coexisting idiopathic (IIH) and spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is often the reason for persistent or worsening symptoms after foramen magnum decompression for Chiari malformation (CM) I. We explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI)/convolutional neural networks (CNN) in Chiari I malformation in a combinatorial role for the first time in literature, exploring both upstream and downstream magnetic resonance findings as initial screening profilers in CM-1. We have also put together a review of all existing subtypes of CM and discuss the role of upright (gravity-aided) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating equivocal tonsillar descent on a lying-down MRI. We have formulated a workflow algorithm MaChiP 1.0 (Manjila Chiari Protocol 1.0) using upstream and downstream profilers, that cause de novo or worsening Chiari I malformation, which we plan to implement using AI.Materials and Methods: The PRISMA guidelines were used for "CM and machine learning and CNN" on PubMed database articles, and four articles specific to the topic were encountered. The radiologic criteria for IIH and SIH were applied from neurosurgical literature, and they were applied between primary and secondary (acquired) Chiari I malformations. An upstream etiology such as IIH or SIH and an isolated downstream etiology in the spine were characterized using the existing body of literature. We propose the utility of using four selected criteria for IIH and SIH each, over MRI T2 images of the brain and spine, predominantly sagittal sequences in upstream etiology in the brain and multiplanar MRI in spinal lesions.Results: Using MaChiP 1.0 (patent/ copyright pending) concepts, we have proposed the upstream and downstream profilers implicated in progressive Chiari I malformation. The upstream profilers included findings of brain sagging, slope of the third ventricular floor, pontomesencephalic angle, mamillopontine distance, lateral ventricular angle, internal cerebral vein-vein of Galen angle, and displacement of iter, clivus length, tonsillar descent, etc., suggestive of SIH. The IIH features noted in upstream pathologies were posterior flattening of globe of the eye, partial empty sella, optic nerve sheath distortion, and optic nerve tortuosity in MRI. The downstream etiologies involved spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak from dural tear, meningeal diverticula, CSF-venous fistulae, etc.Conclusion: AI would help offer predictive analysis along the spectrum of upstream and downstream etiologies, ensuring safety and efficacy in treating secondary (acquired) Chiari I malformation, especially with coexisting IIH and SIH. The MaChiP 1.0 algorithm can help document worsening of a previously diagnosed CM-1 and find the exact etiology of a secondary CM-I. However, the role of posterior fossa morphometry and cine-flow MRI data for intracranial CSF flow dynamics, along with advanced spinal CSF studies using dynamic myelo-CT scanning in the formation of secondary CM-I is still being evaluated.

TI Combined lung and brain ultrasonography for an individualized
   "brain-protective ventilation strategy" in neurocritical care patients
   with challenging ventilation needs
SO CRITICAL ULTRASOUND JOURNAL
AB When intracranial hypertension and severe lung damage coexist in the same clinical scenario, their management poses a difficult challenge, especially as concerns mechanical ventilation management. The needs of combined lung and brain protection from secondary damage may conflict, as ventilation strategies commonly used in patients with ARDS are potentially associated with an increased risk of intracranial hypertension. In particular, the use of positive end-expiratory pressure, recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and protective lung ventilation can have undesirable effects on cerebral physiology: they may positively or negatively affect intracranial pressure, based on the final repercussions on PaO2 and cerebral perfusion pressure (through changes in cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, venous return, PaO2 and PaCO2), also according to the baseline conditions of cerebral autoregulation. Lung ultrasound (LUS) and brain ultrasound (BUS, as a combination of optic nerve sheath diameter assessment and cerebrovascular Doppler ultrasound) have independently proven their potential in respectively monitoring lung aeration and brain physiology at the bedside. In this narrative review, we describe how the combined use of LUS and BUS on neurocritical patients with demanding mechanical ventilation needs can contribute to ventilation management, with the aim of a tailored "brain-protective ventilation strategy".

TI Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome
SO ANAESTHESIA
AB The pressure within the abdominal cavity is normally little more than atmospheric pressure. However, even small increases in intra-abdominal pressure can have adverse effects on renal function, cardiac output, hepatic blood flow, respiratory mechanics, splanchnic perfusion and intracranial pressure. Although intra-abdominal pressure can be measured directly, this is invasive and bedside measurement of intra-abdominal pressure is usually achieved via the urinary bladder. This cheap, easy approach has been shown to produce results that correlate closely with directly measured abdominal pressures. Significant increases in intra-abdominal pressure are seen in a wide variety of conditions commonly encountered in the intensive care unit, such as ruptured aortic aneurysm, abdominal trauma and acute pancreatitis. Abdominal compartment syndrome describes the combination of increased intra-abdominal pressure and end-organ dysfunction. This syndrome has a high mortality, most deaths resulting from sepsis and multi-organ failure. Detection of abdominal compartment syndrome requires close surveillance of intra-abdominal pressure in patients thought to be at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension. The only available treatment for established abdominal compartment syndrome is decompressive laparotomy. Prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome after laparotomy by adoption of an open abdomen approach may be preferable in the patient at significant risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension, but this has not been demonstrated in any large trials. Most surgeons prefer to adopt a 'wait and see' policy, only intervening when clinical deterioration is associated with a significant increase in intra-abdominal pressure.

TI INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE DURING ELECTROSHOCK CONVULSIONS IN DOG
SO NEUROLOGY
AB In an effort to elucidate the mechanism by which electroconvulsive therapy produced clinical improvement, we have investigated hemodynamics and intracranial pressure in dogs during repeated electroshock seizures. During seizures in anesthetized dogs the intracranial pressure measured by a subdural balloon rises to over 50 mm.Hg. Cerebral venous pressure measured by a catheter in the superior sagittal sinus rises in a generally parallel fashion, but to a lower value. A small balloon placed subdurally between the cerebral hemispheres was a more reliable indicator of intracranial pressure changes, especially rapid changes, than cisterna magna or lumbar subarachnoid space recordings. Motor responses to stimulation differed from those seen in human beings. At the end of stimulation the dogs relaxed for 1-6 seconds before going into tonic extension. The peak intracranial pressures were reached during the tonic extensor phase of the seizure. During the stimulation there was bradycardia or cardiac arrest. At the end of stimulation there was a great increase in pulse pressure with bradycardia persisting. Arterial pressure generally fell during stimulation, then rose after stimulation, reaching a peak at about the same time as the subdural pressure. When the duration of stimulation was lengthened, the peak of intracranial pressure was reached during stimulation, and the motor afterresponse was much attenuated. In animals paralyzed by succinyl-chollne, intracranial pressure rose in a manner comparable to that in unparalyzed animals, with the exception that the sudden rise in pressure at the onset of stimulation was eliminated. Unanesthetized animals showed less bradycardia during stimulation, with rises in systolic pressure of about 150 mm. Hg, while subdural and sagittal sinus pressures rose to higher levels (over 80 mm. Hg) than in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs. Tonic extensor seizures developed during the 15- second stimulation period and did not seem obviously alteredby the termination of stimulation. Changes in venous pressure by clamping intrathoracic vessels and changes in arterial pressure inducedby drugs were of secondary importance in affecting intracranial pressure. Direct measurements of cerebral venous flow and perfusion pressure in a few dogs have suggested that lowered cerebro-vascular resistance is the primary reason for increased cerebral blood flow during convulsions.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in patients with cerebral small
   vessel disease: A case report
SO MEDICINE
AB Introduction:Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) without any identifiable cause. However, restrictions of cerebrospinal fluid absorption from the cerebral venous system, the glymphatic system overflow, and the cerebrospinal fluid's lymphatic pathways may be involved in the pathophysiology of IIH. Furthermore, an impaired glymphatic system is also implicated in the initiation and progression of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Here, we reported a case of CSVD with concomitant IIH, possibly associated with the brain's glymphatic and lymphatic system dysfunction. Case concern:A 39-year-old male presented with worsening headaches over the bilateral parietal areas during the past year and nausea for 2 days. Fundus examination revealed bilateral papilledema and lumbar puncture suggestive of elevated ICP, laboratory results showed hyperhomocysteinemia and mutation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T. On magnetic resonance imaging, subcortical small infarct, white matter lesions, lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces and dilatation of the optic nerve sheaths was detected, and right transverse sinus stenosis and a hypoplastic left sinus were showed on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography Diagnosis:The diagnoses of IIH, CSVD, transverse sinus stenosis, and hyperhomocysteinemia were performed. Intervision and outcomes:The patient received antihypertensive, antiplatelet, anti-atherosclerotic, and homocysteine-lowering therapies. Finally, the patient's symptoms remised, and the increased ICP returned to normal; however, the bilateral TSS persisted after 3 months of follow-up. Conclusions:In this case, we speculate that the normal glymphatic outflow pathway may serve as a compensatory mechanism for regulating increased ICP in patients with bilateral venous sinus obstruction, indicating impaired venous outflow pathway, possibly associated with dysfunction of the glymphatic and lymphatic systems in patients with CSVD.

TI Stenting of a venous stenosis in vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB The vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM) is a high flow arteriovenous shunt at the choroidal level. In the neonatal period, it typically presents with cardiac failure. Venous stenoses, occlusions and anomalies are often present. In the absence of adequate venous outflow pathways, severe, irreversible cerebral parenchymal damage may occur due to intracranial venous hypertension, altered hydrodynamics and ischaemia. We present a case of deployment of a stent across a focal superior jugular bulb stenosis in an effort to avert this outcome.

TI Anatomic Variation of the Lateral Sinus in Patients With Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension: Delineation With Black-Blood
   Contrast-Enhanced MRI
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the peculiar anatomic variations in the lateral sinus and analyze the patterns of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage by using high-resolution (HR) black-blood (BB) contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).Methods: Total 33 IIH patients who were found cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS) by MR venography (MRV) were enrolled in this study. HR-BB contrast-enhanced MRI was used to assess the features of anatomical variations in transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus. The development of bilateral sinuses was firstly evaluated, including unilateral hypoplasia with contralateral dominance or bilateral balanced development. Then, four kinds of anatomical variations were eventually recorded, including circumscribed stenosis, arachnoid granulation (AG), fibrous septum (FS), and brain herniation (BH) into dural venous sinus (DVS).Results: Bilateral venous drainage dysfunction was found in 30(90.9%) patients, whereas only 3(9.1%) patients presented unilateral venous drainage dysfunction. There was no difference in clinical symptoms between the two groups. The most common case is hypoplasia in unilateral sinus combined with anatomic variation in the contralateral dominant transverse sinus such as AG and BH into DVS. Total of 52 anatomic variations were finally found in bilateral sinuses in 33 enrolled patients, including 19(36.5%)AGs, 12(23.1%)FS, 7(13.5%) BH into DVS and 14(26.9%) circumscribed stenoses. Moreover, 41(62.1%) lateral sinuses showed enhancement in T1-weight-enhanced MRI.Conclusions: Patients with CVSS almost had CSF outflow disorders, whatever bilateral equalization or unilateral hypoplasia with contralateral dominance. Four types of main anatomic variations, including circumscribed stenosis, AG, FS, and BH into DVS, caused venous reflux obstruction by elevating the intracranial press (ICP).

TI Intrathoracic Pressure Regulation Improves 24-Hour Survival in a
   Pediatric Porcine Model of Hemorrhagic Shock
SO PEDIATRIC RESEARCH
AB Hemorrhagic shock is a common cause of mortality and morbidity in the pediatric population. Intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) lowers intrathoracic pressure, thereby decreasing intracranial pressure and increasing venous return, cardiac output, and cerebral perfusion without the need for immediate fluid resuscitation. We hypothesized that IPR would improve hemodynamics and 24-h survival in a pediatric porcine model of hemorrhagic shock. Twenty piglets were subjected to a 50% total blood volume hemorrhage over 15 min and then randomized to treatment with either IPR or no treatment. After 60 min, survivors were autotransfused, weaned from the ventilator, and assessed and autopsied at 24 h. Mean arterial pressures (MAPs), cardiac index (CI), and arterial blood gases were recorded. MAP (mm Hg) was significantly higher in the IPR group (60.8 +/- 3.7) versus controls (41.2 +/- 4.6, p < 0.01). Mean CI (L/min/m(2)) was significantly higher with IPR (3.9 +/- 0.24) versus controls (2.5 +/- 0.39, p < 0.01). IPR survival rates were significantly improved with IPR [9/9 (IPR) versus 5/11 (controls); p < 0.021. In this piglet model of hemorrhagic shock, IPR treatment safely and significantly improved MAP, Cl, and 24-h survival rates. (Pediair Res 70: 267-271, 2011)

Inspite of increased intracronial pressure an intracronial mass lesion or hydrocephalus is absent. The disease is most common in obese women in childbearing age. The main differential diagnoses ore venous outflow obstructions, most important sinus venous thromboses, and drug side effects. Therapy aims at lowering intracronial pressure and thereby avoid visual loss. If repeated lumbar punctures, weight reduction and medical treatment do not successfully lower intracranial pressure to prevent visual loss, surgical treatment is indicated.

The site of cerebral venous outflow obstruction was variable and identified in three patients with computed tomography, conventional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and/or angiography.  Magnetic resonance angiography used in two patients characterized the venous flow pattern and identified the site of obstruction, confirming magnetic resonance angiography as an effective noninvasive blood flow technique in diagnosing and following these patients.  Three patients were treated successfully with medical therapy and one patient with optic nerve fenestration.

SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Eighteen pediatric patients who sustained traumatic brain injury were enrolled in a double-blind, crossover study comparing the effects of 3% saline and 0.9% saline infusions on raised intracranial pressure (ICP). After resuscitation, each patient received a bolus of each saline concentration, and ICP was monitored for 2 h. Initial mean ICP before 0.9% saline infusions equaled 19.3 mm Hg and averaged 20.0 mm Hg during the subsequent 2-h trials (p = 0.32). Baseline mean ICP before 3% saline administration equaled 19.9 mm Hg and averaged 15.8 mm Hg for 2 h postinfusion (p = 0.003). Central venous pressure did not change significantly in either group, nor did measurements of renal function. Serum sodium concentrations increased in all 18 trials of 3% saline. Maximal concentrations of serum sodium occurred 30 min after bolus administration of 3% saline. Three percent saline significantly reduces raised ICP after traumatic brain injury when compared with normal saline. Intravascular dehydration, as measured by central venous pressure, did not occur during the study period.

TI Reversal of increased intracranial pressure with removal of a torcular
   epidermoid: Case report
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB cause of increased intracranial pressure, but it has been documented rarely. We present a case of obstruction of the torcula by a slow-growing epidermoid. The tumor caused increased intracranial pressure, which was relieved when it was excised. in addition, the torcular epidermoid is associated with a bifid straight sinus.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old man presented with a headache and a lump on the back of the head. Physical examination revealed a firm, bony lesion approximately 4 x 4 cm in size. Lumbar puncture demonstrated an intraspinal pressure of 39 cm H2O. Neuroradiological studies revealed an epidermoid that compressed and almost completely occluded the torcula.
   INTERVENTION: After the tumor was resected, the intraspinal pressure decreased to 19 cm H2O and remained stable 6 months later.
   CONCLUSION: Pure venous obstruction causes increased intracranial pressure. Removal of the obstruction relieves the intracranial hypertension. In addition, computed tomographic venography is a safe and easy method of documenting torcular anatomy, and it was useful in the follow-up of this patient. Computed tomographic venography can demonstrate a double straight sinus, which is a congenital variant that may be associated with the epidermoid.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Purpose of reviewIntracranial pressure (ICP) control is a mainstay of traumatic brain injury (TBI) management. However, development of intracranial hypertension (ICH) may be affected by factors outside of the cranial vault in addition to the local effects of the TBI. This review will examine the pathophysiology of multiple compartment syndrome (MCS) and current treatment considerations for patients with TBI given the effects of MCS.Recent findingsElevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is associated with ICP elevation, and decompressive laparotomy in patients with concurrent elevations in IAP and ICP can reduce ICP. Elevated intrathoracic pressure may be similarly associated with ICP elevation, although the ideal ventilator management strategy for TBI patients when considering MCS is unclear.SummaryIn MCS, intracranial, intrathoracic and intra-abdominal compartment pressures are interrelated. TBI patient care should include ICP control as well as minimization of intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure as clinically possible.

SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Abnormal venous drainage in patients with craniofacial anomalies is relativity uncommon. Sinus pericranii is a rare vascular malformation characterized by communication between intracranial dural sinuses and extracranial venous drainage systems. The association between sinus pericranii and amniotic band syndrome has not been described. We report on a 7-month-old girl diagnosed with amniotic band sequence who underwent posterior fossa decompression due to intracranial hypertension and Chiari malformation type I. The computed tomography and magnetic resonance identified the connection between the sagittal sinus and the scalp. During the operation, the presence of sinus pericranii was a complicating factor limiting the proper exposure because of the risk of bleeding. Patients with craniofacial anomalies and sinus pericranii present an increased risk of serious surgical complications and consequences from craniofacial surgery, especially from cranioplasty and posterior decompression. Special attention must be paid to abnormal venous drainage, and vascular imaging studies are sometimes required.

TI Negative-pressure and low-pressure hydrocephalus: the role of
   cerebrospinal fluid leaks resulting from surgical approaches to the
   cranial base Report of 3 cases
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Object. Negative-pressure and low-pressure hydrocephalus are rare clinical entities that are frequently misdiagnosed. They are characterized by recurrent episodes of shunt failure because the intracranial pressure is lower than the opening pressure of the valve. In this report the authors discuss iatrogenic CSF leaks as a cause of low-or negative-pressure hydrocephalus after approaches to the cranial base.
   Methods. The authors retrospectively reviewed cases of low-pressure or negative-pressure hydrocephalus presenting after cranial approaches complicated with a CSF leak at their institution.
   Results. Three patients were identified. Symptoms of high intracranial pressure and ventriculomegaly were present, although the measured pressures were low or negative. A blocked communication between the ventricles and the subarachnoid space was documented in 2 of the cases and presumed in the third. Shunt revisions failed repeatedly. In all cases, temporary clinical and radiographic improvement resulted from external ventricular drainage at subatmospheric pressures. The CSF leaks were sealed and CSF communication was reestablished operatively. In 1 case, neck wrapping was used with temporary success.
   Conclusions. Negative-pressure or low-pressure hydrocephalus associated with CSF leaks, especially after cranial base approaches, is difficult to treat. The solution often requires the utilization of subatmospheric external ventricular drains to establish a lower ventricular drainage pressure than the drainage pressure created in the subarachnoid space, where the pressure is artificially lowered by the CSF leak. Treatment involves correction of the CSF leak, neck wrapping to increase brain turgor and allow the pressure in the ventricles to rise to the level of the opening pressure of the valve, and reestablishing the CSF route.

TI THE EFFECTS OF FENTANYL AND SUFENTANIL ON INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE AND
   CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW IN RABBITS WITH AN ACUTE CRYOGENIC BRAIN INJURY
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB The cerebrovascular response to the administration of equipotent doses of fentanyl and sufentanil was evaluated in New Zealand white rabbits following cryogenic brain injury. In a preliminary study consisting of 10 animals, it was documented that the cerebral blood flow response to alterations in the PaCO2 remained intact in this model of brain injury. Subsequently, 28 rabbits were anesthetized with 1.5% halothane in oxygen, paralyzed with pancuronium, and mechanically ventilated. A cryogenic lesion was created over the left hemisphere. One hour later, the intracranial pressure had risen to a mean value of 15 mm Hg. Baseline measurements were then made of monitored variables, which included heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, temperature, and arterial blood gases. Global cerebral blood flow was measured utilizing a hydrogen clearance technique. The animals were then randomized to receive an infusion of fentanyl (N = 9, 200 mug/kg), sufentanil (N = 10, 20 mug/kg), or an equal volume of normal saline (N = 9) by i.v. infusion over 5 min. At the conclusion of the opioid infusions, repeated measurements of hemodynamic variables and intracranial pressure were recorded for 15 min and a second cerebral blood flow measurement was made. There were no significant differences in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, cerebral blood flow, or blood gas values between the three groups prior to the administration of fentanyl, sufentanil, or normal saline. At the conclusion of the 5 min infusion, the intracranial pressure had increased by approximately 5 mm Hg in all three groups. The mean arterial pressure decreased to a similar degree in the fentanyl and sufentanil groups and was significantly lower than the mean arterial pressure in the saline group. Although the cerebral perfusion pressure decreased in all three groups, cerebral blood flow was not significantly affected. These results suggest that there is no significant difference in the effects of fentanyl vs. sufentanil on mean arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, or cerebral blood flow in this model of acute brain injury and elevated intracranial pressure.

TI Pseudotumor cerebri in kaposiform lymphangiomatosis: a case report and
   pathogenetic hypothesis
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB A 4-year-old boy with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis (KLA) developed progressive headaches and papilloedema and was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri initially treated with acetazolamide. Clinical deterioration prompted placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. After the surgery, the child's condition has markedly improved.
   A network of intracranial lymphatics is presently being investigated. Neuroimaging excluded KLA infiltration of the skull and/or meninges, leaving as the most plausible explanation for the child's pseudotumor cerebri the existence of an increase in intracranial venous pressure by venous compression at the thorax. To our knowledge, our case constitutes the first report of pseudotumor cerebri occurring in the context of KLA.

TI COLLOID INFUSION AFTER BRAIN INJURY - EFFECT ON INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE,
   CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW, AND OXYGEN DELIVERY
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objectives: We sought to determine the effects of colloid osmotic pressure on cerebral edema formation after brain injury. We hypothesized that an increase in plasma oncotic pressure accompanying a colloid infusion would be associated with a decrease in intracranial pressure and increases in cerebral blood now and oxygen delivery when compared with isotonic crystalloid,
   Design: Prospective, laboratory study.
   Setting: University surgical research laboratory.
   Subjects: Adult swine, both genders.
   Interventions: Cryogenic brain injury with intravenous fluid infusion of either lactated Ringer's solution or 6% dextran-70 in normal saline. The effect of this intervention was monitored for 24 hrs.
   Measurements: Mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, hemoglobin concentration, plasma oncotic pressure, serum osmolality, cerebral blood flow, and specific gravity of cortical biopsies.
   Results: Cryogenic injury significantly increased the cortical water content and the intracranial pressure and significantly decreased the cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery (p < .05). Dextran infusion significantly increased the colloid oncotic pressure. There were no differences between the lactated Ringer's solution and dextran groups in intracranial pressure, cerebral oxygen delivery, or cortical water content after 24 hrs.
   Conclusions: Colloid infusion after a focal cryogenic injury does not increase cerebral oxygen delivery or reduce either cerebral edema formation or intracranial pressure when compared with lactated Ringer's solution. Colloid is not superior to isotonic crystalloid in the management of isolated brain injury.

TI Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension With Dan and Beyond: The 2010
   Jacobson Lecture
SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Neuro-ophthalmologists frequently care for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), although many questions remain unanswered regarding its diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment. The Friedman-Jacobson criteria for the diagnosis of IIH specify lumbar puncture (LP) opening pressure values that are largely based on experience with little supporting normative data. Until recently, there were sparse data to define normal values of the LP opening pressure in children. Papilledema, the sine qua non of IIH, may not always be present, but the frequency of true IIH without papilledema is controversial and the threshold for diagnosing it varies among clinicians. Concepts regarding the pathogenesis of IIH continue to evolve; venous hypertension is certainly implicated even though it is uncertain whether venous sinus stenosis is the cause or effect of increased intracranial pressure. The 2010 Jacobson Lecture discusses the evidence for some of the prevailing assumptions about normal lumbar puncture opening pressure, venous sinus stenosis, and the phenotypic continuum between chronic daily headaches and IIH.

TI Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome: venous sinus obstruction and its treatment
   with stent placement
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Object. Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is a condition of raised intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion or cerebral edema. It is characterized by headache and visual deterioration that may culminate in blindness. Pseudotumor cerebri is caused by venous sinus obstruction in an unknown percentage of cases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of cerebral venous sinus disease in pseudotumor cerebri and the potential of endoluminal venous sinus stent placement as a new treatment.
   Methods. Nine consecutive patients in whom diagnoses of pseudotumor cerebri had been made underwent examination with direct retrograde cerebral venography (DRCV) and manometry to characterize the morphological features and venous pressures in their cerebral venous sinuses. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was measured simultaneously in two patients. If patients had an amenable lesion they were treated using an endoluminal venous sinus stent. Five patients demonstrated morphological obstruction of the venous transverse sinuses (TSs). All lesions were associated with a distinct pressure gradient and raised proximal venous sinus pressures. Four patients underwent stent insertion in the venous sinuses and reported that their headaches improved immediately after the procedure and remained so at 6 months. Vision was improved in three patients, whereas it remained poor in one despite normalized CSF pressures.
   Conclusions. Patients with pseudotumor cerebri should be evaluated with DRCV and manometry because venous TS obstruction is probably more common than is currently appreciated. In patients with a lesion of the venous sinuses, treatment with an endoluminal venous sinus stent is a viable alternative for amenable lesions.

TI The effect of alfentanil on cerebrospinal fluid pressure in human
   volunteers
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY
AB Although the administration of alfentanil is routine in neurosurgical anaesthesia, the effects of the drug on cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) or intracranial pressure (ICP) have been a subject of controversy in the past. Therefore the effects of alfentanil (3 mu g kg(-1)) on mean lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)) in human volunteers without cerebral disease is reported here. The CSFP increased from 9 mmHg (P<0.05) after intravenous (i.v.) injection of alfentanil, to 12 mmHg whereas MAP, CVP HR and ETCO(2), remained stable throughout the investigative period. The results from this study suggest that alfentanil, even when administered in low doses, leads to a relatively small but statistically significant increase in CSFP in humans with uncompromised intracranial compliance.

TI Improved cerebral perfusion pressures and 24-hr neurological survival in
   a porcine model of cardiac arrest with active compression-decompression
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation and augmentation of negative intrathoracic
   pressure
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: Generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during the decompression phase of cardiopulmonary resuscitation enhances the refilling of the heart. We tested the hypothesis that when compared with closed-chest manual compressions at 80 chest compressions per min, treatment with active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation at 80 chest compressions/min combined with augmentation of negative intrathoracic pressure would lower intracranial pressure and increase cerebral perfusion, thereby improving neurologically intact survival rates following prolonged untreated cardiac arrest.
   Design: Prospective, randomized animal study.
   Setting: Animal laboratory facilities.
   Subjects: A total of 26 female farm pigs in two different protocols (n = 17 and n = 9).
   Interventions, Measurements, and Main Results: Seventeen pigs were subjected to 8.5 mins of untreated ventricular fibrillation and prospectively randomized to cardiopulmonary resuscitation at 80 chest compressions/min or active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation at 80 chest compressions/min plus an impedance threshold device. Coronary perfusion pressures (29.5 +/- 2.7 mm Hg vs. 22.4 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p = .03), carotid blood flow (44.0 +/- 12.2 vs. 30.9 +/- 10.4, p = .03), and 24-hr neurological survival (88% vs. 22%, p = .015) were higher with active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation + an impedance threshold device. Cerebral perfusion pressures, measured in nine additional pigs, were improved with active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation + an impedance threshold device (21.9 +/- 1.2mm Hg vs. 8.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, p < .0001). With active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation + impedance threshold device, mean diastolic intracranial pressure during decompression was lower (12.2 +/- 0.2 mm Hg vs. 16.6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, p = .02) and the downward slope of the decompression phase intracranial pressure curve was steeper (-60.3 +/- 12.9 mm Hg vs. -46.7 +/- 11.1 mm Hg/sec, p < .001).
   Conclusions: Active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation + an impedance threshold device increased cerebral perfusion pressures and lowered diastolic intracranial pressure and intracranial pressure rate during the decompression phase. These mechanisms may underlie the observed increase in cerebral perfusion pressure, carotid blood flow, and survival rates with favorable neurologic outcomes in this pig model of cardiac arrest.

TI Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Duration After Venous Sinus Stenting for
   Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension and Stent Survival-Is Longer
   Necessarily Better? A Meta-Regression
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Venous stenting (VS) for venous sinus stenosis in the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been increasing in acceptance by neurointerventionalists. Stent-adjacent stenosis (SAS) and instent stenosis leading to symptom recurrence and the need for retreatment are known delayed complications. However, the effect of the dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration on these complications has remained poorly characterized. METHODS: An extensive literature search was performed to identify reports of VS for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension from 2000 to 2020. The primary outcome was the occurrence of SAS. The secondary outcomes included the occurrence of composite stenosis (in-stent stenosis and SAS) and stent survival, defined as the need for retreatment or other surgical management. Generalized linear mixed models were used to explore the effects of DAPT duration (3 vs >= 6 months) on the primary and secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 325 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in our analysis. SAS occurred in 9% (95% confidence interval, 6%-15%) of the patients, and stent survival was 90% (95% confidence interval, 84%-93%) in the cohort. With every 1-mm Hg increase in the venous pressure gradient, an 8% decrease was found in the odds of stent survival (P [ 0.043). The meta-regression revealed no association between the DAPT duration and the primary outcome or the odds of composite stenosis and stent survival. CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences between 3 and >= 6 months of DAPT in terms of the risk of stent stenosis or stent survival. However, patients with a higher venous pressure gradient before VS had a greater risk of stent failure.

TI Transient resolution of venous sinus stenosis after high-volume lumbar
   puncture in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Stenosis of the transverse sinus (TS) and sigmoid sinus (SS), with a trans-stenosis pressure gradient, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). MRI has shown improvement in TS and SS stenosis after high-volume lumbar puncture (HVLP) in a subset of patients with IIH. The authors present the first report of an IIH patient with immediate post-HVLP TS and SS trans-stenosis pressure gradient reduction and an attendant increase in TS and SS cross-sectional area confirmed using intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS). Recurrence of the patient's TS-SS stenosis coincided with elevated HVLP opening pressure, and venous sinus stent placement resulted in clinical improvement. This report suggests that TS and SS stenosis may be a downstream effect of elevated intracranial pressure in IIH, rather than its principal etiological mechanism. However, the authors hypothesize that endovascular stenting may obliterate a positive feedback loop involving trans-stenosis pressure gradients, and still benefit appropriately selected patients.

TI Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: pathophysiology and definitions
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB "Intra-abdominal hypertension", the presence of elevated intra-abdominal pressure, and "abdominal compartment syndrome", the development of pressure-induced organ-dysfunction and failure, have been increasingly recognized over the past decade as causes of significant morbidity and mortality among critically ill surgical and medical patients. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure can cause significant impairment of cardiac, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and central nervous system function. The significant prognostic value of elevated intra-abdominal pressure has prompted many intensive care units to adopt measurement of this physiologic parameter as a routine vital sign in patients at risk. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiologic implications of elevated intra-abdominal pressure is fundamental to 1) recognizing the presence of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, 2) effectively resuscitating patients afflicted by these potentially life-threatening diseases, and 3) preventing the development of intra-abdominal pressure-induced end-organ dysfunction and failure. The currently accepted consensus definitions surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome are presented.

TI Lower body negative pressure to safely reduce intracranial pressure
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON
AB Patients with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) exhibit neuro-ocular symptoms including headache, papilloedema and loss of vision. Some of these symptoms are also present in astronauts during and after prolonged space-flight where lack of gravitational stress prevents daily lowering of ICP associated with upright posture. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) simulates the effects of gravity by displacing fluid caudally and we hypothesized that LBNP would lower ICP without compromising cerebral perfusion. Ten cerebrally intact volunteers were included: six ambulatory neurosurgical patients with parenchymal ICP-sensors and four former cancer patients with Ommaya-reservoirs to the frontal horn of a lateral ventricle. We applied LBNP while recording ICP and blood pressure while supine, and during simulated intracranial hypertension by 15 degrees head-down tilt. LBNP from 0 to 50 mmHg at increments of 10 mmHg lowered ICP in a non-linear dose-dependent fashion; when supine (n = 10), ICP was decreased from 15 +/- 2 mmHg to 14 +/- 4, 12 +/- 5, 11 +/- 4, 10 +/- 3 and 9 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.0001). Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), calculated as mean arterial blood pressure at midbrain level minus ICP, was unchanged (from 70 +/- 12 mmHg to 67 +/- 9, 69 +/- 10, 70 +/- 12, 72 +/- 13 and 74 +/- 15 mmHg; P = 0.02). A 15 degrees head-down tilt (n = 6) increased ICP to 26 +/- 4 mmHg, while application of LBNP lowered ICP (to 21 +/- 4, 20 +/- 4, 18 +/- 4, 17 +/- 4 and 17 +/- 4 mmHg; P < 0.0001) and increased CPP (P < 0.01). An LBNP of 20 mmHg may be the optimal level to lower ICP without impairing CPP to counteract spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome in astronauts. Furthermore, LBNP holds clinical potential as a safe, non-invasive method for lowering ICP and improving CPP for patients with pathologically elevated ICP on Earth.

TI Cerebral venous collaterals: A new fort for fighting ischemic stroke?
SO PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB Stroke therapy has entered a new era highlighted by the use of endovascular therapy in addition to intravenous thrombolysis. However, the efficacy of current therapeutic regimens might be reduced by their associated adverse events. For example, over-reperfusion and futile recanalization may lead to large infarct, brain swelling, hemorrhagic complication and neurological deterioration. The traditional pathophysiological understanding on ischemic stroke can hardly address these occurrences. Accumulating evidence suggests that a functional cerebral venous drainage, the major blood reservoir and drainage system in brain, may be as critical as arterial infusion for stroke evolution and clinical sequelae. Further exploration of the multi-faceted function of cerebral venous system may add new implications for stroke outcome prediction and future therapeutic decision-making. In this review, we emphasize the anatomical and functional characteristics of the cerebral venous system and illustrate its necessity in facilitating the arterial infusion and maintaining the cerebral perfusion in the pathological stroke content. We then summarize the recent critical clinical studies that underscore the associations between cerebral venous collateral and outcome of ischemic stroke with advanced imaging techniques. A novel three-level venous system classification is proposed to demonstrate the distinct characteristics of venous collaterals in the setting of ischemic stroke. Finally, we discuss the current directions for assessment of cerebral venous collaterals and provide future challenges and opportunities for therapeutic strategies in the light of these new concepts.

TI Pseudotumour cerebri, CSF rhinorrhoea and the role of venous sinus
   stenting in treatment
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB We present a case of pseudotumour cerebri (PTC), which is important as it illustrates the effects of chronically raised CSF pressure, the relationship between PTC and venous sinus obstruction and the successful treatment of PTC using a venous sinus stent. A 38-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with PTC and unsuccessfully treated 10 years previously represented with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea. Imaging revealed dramatic changes of chronically raised CSF pressure and a defect in the anterior cranial fossa. The CSF leak was corrected surgically and a lumbo-peritoneal shunt inserted to correct a large postoperative subgaleal CSF collection. Direct retrograde cerebral venography (DRCV) demonstrated venous sinus obstruction due to a filling defect. This was associated with a pressure gradient and a high superior sagittal sinus pressure. The venous sinus obstruction was successfully treated with a venous sinus stent and the lumbo-peritoneal shunt was removed. Chronically raised CSF pressure in untreated cases of PTC may cause widespread changes in the skull, which in this case, culminated in a spontaneous CSF leak despite relatively mild headache and visual symptoms. Furthermore, cases of PTC secondary to venous sinus obstruction may be successfully treated using venous sinus stenting. The index of suspicion for venous sinus stenosis or obstruction should be raised in the investigation of patients with PTC.

TI Acute Posttraumatic Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis-Induced Malignant
   Increased Intracranial Pressure Treated with Endovascular Dural Sinus
   Thrombectomy and Stenting
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a major complication after head injury. Impaired venous outflow caused by CVST leads to increased intracranial pressure (IICP) refractory to medications and surgical decompression and often results in devastating consequences. Currently, there is no consensus on the treatment strategy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we report a case of posttraumatic CVST in a young male motorcyclist involved in a high-speed traffic accident. On admission, the patient immediately underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy. However, refractory malignant IICP developed within 24 hours after the operation. Computed tomography venography revealed compression of the right sigmoid sinus by the fractured temporal bone and extensive thrombosis toward the jugular bulb. Dural sinus thrombectomy and stenting were performed accordingly. After the procedure, IICP was alleviated immediately and the sedatives and medications were tapered off within days. The patient gradually recovered from deep comatose status and underwent cranioplasty 5 weeks later. Finally, the patient was discharged with only mild left wrist weakness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Acute cerebral sinus thrombosis caused by trauma may result in malignant IICP refractory to medications and surgical decompression. We have demonstrated that endovascular angioplasty and sinus stenting are effective in restoring venous outflow and reducing intracranial pressure. We have also demonstrated that appropriate and timely interventions are important to ensure quick and good recovery in patients with CVST.

TI Ultrasonographic optic nerve sheath diameter monitoring of elevated
   intracranial pressure: two case reports
SO ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Ultrasonography assessments of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is a non-invasive method that may help identify elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). However, this technique was used to evaluate the elevated ICP caused by traumatic brain injury. The objective of this study was to examine clinical cases of the changes in ICP with venous sinus stenosis and venous sinus thrombosis found the advantage of this technique in the application. And we dynamically monitor ONSD and ICP as a lens for understanding the dynamic assessment for ICP. The first case of venous sinus stenosis with elevated ICP identified in real-time by changes in ONSD, which are correlated with ICP before and after stenting. Another case of venous sinus thrombosis with elevated ICE And after treatment, the patient underwent an ultrasound ONSD examination and lumbar puncture (LP) at the 1st, the 2nd and 3rd month of follow-up. The previously enlarged ONSDs retracted and LP opening pressure gradually returned to normal. These cases indicate that ONSD examination may help dynamically assess ICP changes and evaluate the efficacy of ICP treatment. These results provide utile, evidence based, preliminary clinical recommendations and indicate that ONSD examination might be a useful method of evaluating ICP, especially if repeated evaluations are needed.

TI Dural venous sinus angioplasty and stenting for the treatment of
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) and optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) are accepted surgical therapies for medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). In the subset of patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis, dural venous sinus stenting has emerged as an alternative surgical approach.
   Methods All cases of dural stents for IIH at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Eligibility criteria included medically refractory IIH with documented papilledema and dural venous sinus stenosis of the dominant venous outflow system (gradient >= 10 mm Hg).
   Results Fifteen cases (all women) of mean age 34 years were identified. All had failed medical therapy and six had failed surgical intervention. Technical success was achieved in all patients without major periprocedural complications. The mean preprocedural gradient across the venous stenosis was reduced from 24 mm Hg before the procedure to 4 mm Hg after the procedure. Headache resolved or improved in 10 patients. Papilledema resolved in all patients and visual acuity stabilized or improved in 14 patients. There were no instances of restenosis among the 14 patients with follow-up imaging.
   Conclusion In this small case series, dural sinus stenting for IIH was performed safely with a high degree of technical success and with excellent clinical outcomes. These results suggest that angioplasty and stenting for the treatment of medically refractory IIH in patients with dural sinus stenosis warrants further investigation as an alternative to LPS, VPS and ONSF.

TI Detection of important venous collaterals by computed tomography
   venogram in multisutural synostosis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB The authors describe the novel use of computed tomography (CT) venography in the preoperative evaluation of a child with Crouzon syndrome who was being considered for Chiari decompression. This 18-month-old girl presented with hydrocephalus (treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt) and persistent symptomatic Chiari malformation and associated syrinx. A CT venogram, was obtained because of the well-described relationship between multisutural craniosynostosis and abnormal intracranial-to-extracranial venous drainage. The CT venogram showed widely dilated vertebral and paravertebral veins located in the paraspinous muscles of the craniocervical junction. Because of the risk of massive intraoperative blood loss and/or occlusion of important collateral draining veins leading to intracranial venous hypertension and intractably raised intracranial pressure, the planned posterior fossa decompression was not performed. Computed tomography venography is an easily obtained study that we recommend in the evaluation of children with multisutural craniosynostosis prior to cranial surgical interventions.

AB Prolonging the therapeutic window for treatment is imperative for survival from a multitude of life-threatening events such as hemorrhage, cardiac arrest, and stroke. Inspiratory resistance breathing is a therapeutic approach that augments the reduction in intrathoracic and intracranial pressure during inspiration, facilitating improvements in vital organ perfusion under conditions of ischemia, such as blood loss and cardiac arrest. In this review a series of studies will be presented assessing the role of inspiratory resistance breathing on responses of cerebral blood flow and cerebral tissue oxygenation under conditions of cardiac arrest and blood loss in animal models, and simulated hemorrhage in humans. Knowledge gaps in this field of investigation will be presented, and future research directions will be discussed.

TI Incidence and predictors of dural venous sinus pressure gradient in
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension and non-idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension headache patients: results from 164 cerebral venograms
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE Cerebral venous pressure gradient (CVPG) from dural venous sinus stenosis is implicated in headache syndromes such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The incidence of CVPG in headache patients has not been reported.
   METHODS The authors reviewed all cerebral venograms with manometry performed for headache between January 2008 and May 2015. Patient demographics, headache etiology, intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements, and radiographic and manometric results were recorded. CVPG was defined as a difference 8 mm Hg by venographic manometry.
   RESULTS One hundred sixty-four venograms were performed in 155 patients. There were no procedural complications. Ninety-six procedures (58.5%) were for patients with IIH. The overall incidence of CVPG was 25.6% (42 of 164 procedures): 35.4% (34 of 96 procedures) in IIH patients and 11.8% (8 of 68 procedures) in non-IIH patients. Sixty procedures (36.6%) were performed in patients with preexisting shunts. Seventy-seven patients (49.7%) had procedures preceded by an ICP measurement within 4 weeks of venography, and in 66 (85.7%) of these patients, the ICP had been found to be elevated. CVPG was seen in 8.3% (n = 5) of the procedures in the 60 patients with a preexisting shunt and in 0% (n = 0) of the 11 procedures in the 77 patients with normal ICP (p < 0.001 for both). Noninvasive imaging (MR venography, CT venography) was assessed prior to venography in 112 (68.3%) of 164 cases, and dural venous sinus abnormalities were demonstrated in 73 (65.2%) of these cases; there was a trend toward CVPG (p = 0.07). Multivariate analysis demonstrated an increased likelihood of CVPG in patients with IIH (OR 4.97, 95% CI 1.71-14.47) and a decreased likelihood in patients with a preexisting shunt (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.44).
   CONCLUSIONS CVPG is uncommon in IIH patients, rare in those with preexisting shunts, and absent in those with normal ICP.

TI Low-pressure laparoscopy may ameliorate intracranial hypertension and
   renal hypoperfusion
SO JOURNAL OF LAPAROENDOSCOPIC & ADVANCED SURGICAL TECHNIQUES-PART A
AB Background: Increased abdominal pressure is associated with elevations in the intracranial pressure (ICP) and impaired renal function. These adverse effects are potentially important in clinical situations such as severe abdominal trauma and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. It was hypothesized that the secondary elevation of ICP leads to release of vasoconstrictors, which may affect renal function by decreasing the renal blood flow (RBF). We investigated the effect of laparoscopy on ICP and renal blood flow in a porcine model.
   Materials and Methods: The abdominal pressure of swine (N = 5; 20-25 kg) was gradually increased from baseline to 5, 15, and 25 nun Hg by insufflation of nitrogen into the abdominal cavity. The ICP was measured using a Camino(R) monitor, and RBF was simultaneously measured using a Transonic(R) Doppler probe placed on the renal artery. Results were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and the paired t-test.
   Results: No significant change from baseline was observed in ICP and RBF when the abdominal pressure was 5 mm Hg. However, both ICP and RBF were affected by increasing the abdominal pressure to 15 and 25 mm Hg (P = 0.035 and 0.04 for ICP and P = 0.074 and 0.034 for RBF, respectively).
   Conclusions: Low-pressure laparoscopy may reduce the adverse effects of pneumoperitoneum on ICP and RBF. It may be advisable to use low pressures in laparoscopic surgery, especially when changes in ICP or renal perfusion may have significant clinical implications.

TI Headache caused by raised intracranial pressure and intracranial
   hypotension
SO CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY
AB Extremes of intracranial pressure commonly cause headache. Benign intracranial hypertension is a rare syndrome of increased intracranial pressure manifesting as headache, intracranial noises, transient visual obscuration, and palsy of the sixth cranial nerve. Endocrine disorders such as obesity and hypoparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis A, tetracycline use and thyroid replacement are probable causes of benign intracranial hypertension. In the majority of cases, however, it is idiopathic. Benign intracranial hypertension is thought to be caused by cerebral edema, high cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance and high cerebral venous pressure, or a combination of the three. The management of benign intracranial hypertension includes, symptomatic headache relief, removal of offending risk factor(s), and medical or surgical reduction of intracranial pressure. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is more rare than benign intracranial hypertension. Postural headache (worse in the upright position) is the hallmark of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Typically the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is less than 60 mm H2O. Diminished cerebrospinal fluid production, hyperabsorption, and leak are postulated mechanisms of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Empirical treatment includes bed rest, administration of caffeine, corticosteroids or mineralocorticoids, epidural blood patch, and epidural saline infusion.

TI Pathophysiology of intraabdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment
   syndrome and relevance to veterinary critical care
SO JOURNAL OF VETERINARY EMERGENCY AND CRITICAL CARE
AB Background Increased intraabdominal pressure, termed intraabdominal hypertension (IAH), is reported as an independent cause of morbidity and mortality in the human ICU but, until recently, has been rarely described in veterinary species outside of experimental models. Failure to identify severe IAH leads to organ dysfunction, termed abdominal compartment syndrome, and rapidly becomes fatal without therapeutic intervention. Although the veterinary community has been slow to address the concept of IAH and associated comorbidities, recent companion and large animal case series and experimental studies suggest IAH may also be common in veterinary species and correlates well with risk factors and grading systems already described in the human literature. Pathophysiology Increasing abdominal pressures exert deleterious local effects through visceral ischemia and reperfusion injury as well as systemic effects on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and central nervous systems. Even mild grades of IAH increase systemic vascular resistance, impede venous return, increase pulmonary wedge pressure, and decrease pulmonary function. More severe grades cause azotemia, oliguria, decreased coronary blood flow, hypoxia, increased intracranial pressure, and death. Importance Many of the common diseases in veterinary patients are associated with IAH, including gastric dilatation-volvulus, colon volvulus, closed pyometra, hemoperitoneum, ascites, uroperitoneum, and hydrops. Monitoring of the veterinary patient is difficult, but several experimental studies validate both the presence of IAH and the ability to monitor abdominal pressures in large and small animal species. Moreover, prompt recognition of IAH and subsequent treatment is feasible in the veterinary ICU. Key points Increasing abdominal pressures exert deleterious local effects through visceral ischemia and reperfusion injury as well as systemic effects on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and central nervous systems. Increases in central venous pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary wedge pressure, and a decreased cardiac output by way of both decreased preload and increased afterload have been documented as a result of intraabdominal hypertension (IAH). Direct diagnosis of IAH is achieved by blind or ultrasound-guided abdominal needle puncture attached to a water manometer or direct pressure monitoring transducer. Transvesicular measurement of intraabdominal pressure (IAP) is relatively noninvasive, and many patients that would benefit from rapid diagnosis of IAH and abdominal compartment syndrome already have indwelling bladder catheters. Recommendations for interventions are based on the assigned grade of IAH (mild, moderate, severe). Key points If IAH is strongly suspected or diagnosed, abdominal wall compliance may be improved through judicious use of neuromuscular blockers and sedation. Decompression, either minimally invasive or surgical, is absolutely recommended for IAPs consistently above 20 mm Hg, especially in the presence of signs attributed to secondary organ dysfunction.

SO NEUROLOGIC CLINICS
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension causes headache, papilledema and visual field loss, typically in obese women of childbearing age. Its anatomical underpinnings remain unclear, but a stenosis at the junction of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses has been recognized in the majority of patients through venography. The stenosis may result from intrinsic dural sinus anatomy or extrinsic compression by increased intracranial pressure, but in either case, its stenting has been shown to lead to an improvement in symptoms of intracranial hypertension and papilledema in multiple retrospective, non-controlled studies. Prospective, controlled trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.

TI THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF VENTILATION IN CHANGES OF ICP OF
   BRAIN-INJURED PATIENTS
SO INTENSIVBEHANDLUNG
AB The effects on ICP [intracranial pressure] of hyperventilation, continuous PEEP [positive end-expiratory pressure] ventilation, and positive-negative pressure ventilation (PNPB) were investigated in 8 patients with reference to central and peripheral circulatory parameters. When the patient is being hyperventilated, ICP decreases significantly; a moderate increase of ventilation (PCO2 [partial pressure of CO2] up to 32 mm Hg) is followed by a greater ICP reduction than is the case in intensive hyperventilation. The higher the initial ICP values are, the greater is the final ICP reduction. PEEP ventilation results in a significant increase of ICP; with higher pressure values, the increase in ICP is greater. PNPB leads to a significant decrease in ICP and in CVP [central venous pressure]. This kind of ventilation is seldom used in intensive care. In the case of endangered patients, a moderate hyperventilation scheme, recommended for at least the first 4 posttraumatic days, seems effective.

TI Unruptured dural arteriovenous malformation of the transversesigmoid
   sinus presenting with focal symptoms and coma
SO NEUROCIRUGIA
AB We are presenting the case of a 63 year-old man with a dural arteriovenous malformation of the transverse sigmoid sinus who developed focal deficits followed by less localized symptoms such a disorientation, lethargy and eventually comatose status. Initial cerebral angiography showed retrograde filling of the cortical and deep cerebral venous system with marked delay in venous empting. Following, embolization clinical symptoms completely cleared at the time that control angiography showed retrograde venous flow turning anterograde. Patient's symptoms recurred four months later when there was a relapse of retrograde cerebral venous drainage at the time he developed thrombosis of the superior longitudinal and right transverse sinuses. Sinus thrombosis and thrombosis of the central retinal artery were coincidental with hypercoagulability related to hyperhomocysteinemia. Since control angiography still showed persistence of the AV shunting radical excision of the involved dural sinuses was performed. The final outcome was excellent.
   The physiopathological mechanism responsible for neurological deficits in our patient most likely was ischemia of venous origin secondary to venous hypertension resulting from retrograde cerebral venous drainage. The clinical and angiographic presentation in few similar cases reported in the literature is reviewed.

TI Severe brain edema caused by a meningioma obstructing cerebral venous
   outflow and treated with venous sinus stenting
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Peritumoral edema is a common feature of cerebral meningiomas, but venous outflow obstruction is not normally considered as a cause even when a tumor involves the venous sinuses. The authors describe a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in situ, who had undergone several debulking operations and conventional radiotherapy and in whom had developed progressive life-threatening edema from a tentorial meningioma. Radiological studies showed occlusion of the straight sinus and stenosis of the sagittal sinus at the confluence of sinuses. The sagittal sinus was stented, and thereafter the patient made an almost complete symptomatic recovery and returned to work. This case shows that progressive edema in patients with meningioma is not necessarily caused by radiotherapy or tumor enlargement into the brain and that in venous outflow obstruction, addressing the obstructive lesion directly can improve the palliation afforded by a shunt.

TI A descriptive study of venous pressures and gradients while awake and
   both pre- and post-stent under anesthesia in patients with idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background This study aims to explore factors that affect venous sinus pressures and associated gradients while awake and under general anesthesia (GA) both before and after venous sinus stenting (VSS) in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Methods A retrospective analysis was performed examining pressures and gradients in patients with IIH having undergone awake venography followed by VSS under GA. Results 174 patients were included. Compared with awake, GA superior sagittal sinus (SSS) pressures were 2.6 mmHg lower (p=0.01) resulting in a total cranial gradient reduction of 2.5 mmHg (p=0.002). The transverse-sigmoid gradient, the most commonly stented segment, did not differ under the two conditions (p=0.30). Regression analyses demonstrated that body mass index, gender, blood pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide content significantly affected venous pressures (all p<0.05). After stenting, mean total cranial gradients decreased by 13.2 mmHg while skull base gradients increased by 0.8 mmHg. Stenting resulted in an 84% mean reduction in the target gradient and a mean decrease in SSS pressures by 78% of the target gradient. When cardiopulmonary and anesthetic factors were optimized, GA had a limited effect on the target gradient in most patients (p=0.88). Conclusions This study is the largest series to date to report on cerebral venous pressure measurements and gradients recorded while awake and under GA both before and after VSS for IIH. In a well-controlled cardiorespiratory and anesthetic setting, GA venography may provide information that is not substantially inequivalent to that obtained while awake.

TI Life-threatening idiopathic intracranial hypertension: the role of
   venous sinus stenting
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Background Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a clinical syndrome characterised by raised intracranial pressure with no discernible aetiology. It is relatively rare in children and its demographic features may differ from those of adults. The relationship between IIH and venous sinus stenosis (VSS) is well known. As VSS plays an important role in the pathophysiology, treatments have been developed aimed at improving venous blood outflow in refractory IIH. In the last two decades, venous sinus stenting has emerged as a treatment option in cases where stenosis is documented. Methods and results The scientific literature on paediatric cases of IIH and its treatment with venous sinus stenting was analysed. We present the case of a 6-year-old girl with a life-threatening presentation of IIH, who was treated with transverse sinus stenting and a lumboperitoneal shunt. We summarise the characteristic of paediatric stenting cases reported and review the literature focusing on the main aspects of venous sinus stenting. Conclusion VSS stenting could be a treatment tool for the acute presentation of IIH with severe symptoms and VSS plus an elevated trans-stenotic pressure gradient. However, in some cases, additional surgical treatment may be necessary.

TI Clinical Significance of Venous Anomalies in Syndromic Craniosynostosis
SO PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
AB Background: The pattern of cranial venous drainage in syndromic craniosynostosis is unpredictable and not adequately understood. Collateral channels substitute for stenotic venous sinuses and pose potential risk for surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to analyze the patterns of venous drainage in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and their influence on operative planning and morbidity.
   Methods: A retrospective study of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis from 2000 to 2013 was performed. Demographic data were collected including phenotype and associated pathologies. Pre- and/or postoperative venous imaging was reviewed for venous sinus stenosis, collateral emissaries, and persistent fetal sinuses. Categorization of anomalous venous drainage was performed, and the relationship with surgical morbidity was assessed.
   Results: Forty-one patients were identified. Anomalies were present in 31 patients (76%) consisting of dural sinus stenosis in 28 (68%), dilated emissaries in 26 (63%), and fetal sinuses in 7 (17%). Pfeiffer syndrome was most commonly associated with anomalous drainage (100%). Venous anomalies were associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), shunted hydrocephalus, Chiari malformations, and sleep apnea. In 5 cases, the surgical plan was adjusted based on anomalous anatomy. No mortalities occurred. Intraoperative complication rate was 7.3%, all with anomalous drainage. Median estimated blood loss was 1,100 cc for patients with anomalies versus 400 cc without anomalies (P = 0.181).
   Conclusion: Cranial venous anomalies are commonly detected in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and may affect surgical morbidity and outcome with a higher estimated blood loss, alteration of procedure, and postoperative morbidity. Detailed preoperative imaging of the venous drainage is therefore recommended in cases of syndromic synostosis.

TI Dural sinus stent placement for idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Object. The use of unilateral dural sinus stent placement in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has been described by multiple investigators. To date there is a paucity of information on the angiographic and hemodynamic outcome of these procedures. The object of this study was to define the clinical, angiographic, and hemodynamic outcome of placement of unilateral dural sinus stents to treat intracranial venous hypertension in a subgroup of patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for IIH.
   Methods. Eighteen consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of IIH were treated with unilateral stent placement in the transverse-sigmoid junction region. All patients had papilledema. All 12 female patients had headaches; 1 of 6 males had headaches previously that disappeared after weight loss. Seventeen patients had elevated opening pressures at lumbar puncture. Twelve patients had opening pressures of 33-55 cm H2O. All patients underwent diagnostic cerebral arteriography that showed venous outflow compromise by filling defects in the transverse-sigmoid junction region. All patients underwent intracranial selective venous pressure measurements across the filling defects. Follow-up arteriography was performed in 16 patients and follow-up venography/venous pressure measurements were performed in 15 patients.
   Results. Initial pressure gradients across the filling defects ranged from 10.5 to 39 mm Hg. Nineteen stent procedures were performed in 18 patients. One patient underwent repeat stent placement for hemodynamic failure. Pressure gradients were reduced in every instance and ranged from 0 to 7 mm Hg after stenting. Fifteen of 16 patients in whom ophthalmological follow-up was performed experienced disappearance of papilledema. Follow-up arteriography in 16 patients at 5-99 months (mean 25.3 months, median 18.5 months) showed patency of all stents without in-stent restenosis. Two patients had filling defects immediately above the stent. Four other patients developed transverse sinus narrowing above the stent without filling defects. One of these patients underwent repeat stent placement because of hemodynamic deterioration. Two of the other 3 patients had hemodynamic deterioration with recurrent pressure gradients of 10.5 and 18 mm Hg.
   Conclusions. All stents remained patent without restenosis. Stent placement is durable and successfully eliminates papilledema in appropriately selected patients. Continuing hemodynamic success in this series was 80%, and was 87% with repeat stent placement in 1 patient. (DOI: 10.3171/2011.10.JNS101410)

TI Uncommon Presentation of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension in a
   Patient with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Case Report
SO CASE REPORTS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Introduction: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a rare condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory, or radiological evidence of intracranial pathology. Early management could prevent irreversible outcomes. Case Presentation: A 17-year-old single Arabian female of Arab origin presented with a 2-day complaint of horizontal diplopia and transient visual obscurations. She denied any history of headache or decreased vision. The patient was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome a year prior to presentation. Examination revealed bilateral moderate papilledema and limited left eye abduction. However, visual acuity and fields were normal. Increased intracranial pressure was confirmed by lumbar puncture opening pressure (550 mm H2O). The cerebrospinal fluid composition and imaging of brain and cerebral venous system were normal. The diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was confirmed and the patient was treated with acetazolamide 500 mg twice per day. The symptoms totally resolved within 3 days and the papilledema disappeared after 2 months. Conclusion: Awareness of such uncommon presentation of idiopathic intracranial hypertension emphasizes the critical importance of detailed ophthalmic examination and shows the good prognosis of early management.

TI Imaging of the intracranial venous system
SO NEUROLOGIST
AB Background: Evaluation of the intracranial venous system has historically been performed with conventional catheter-based digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The continued importance of DSA can not be overstated in light of its inherent option of endovascular intervention and thrombolysis for cerebral venous thrombosis. DSA is, however, an invasive procedure with associated risks, including radiation exposure, and adverse effects of iodinated contrast medium. DSA also suffers from the limitations of 2-dimensional planar imaging. For these reasons, noninvasive imaging techniques are playing a greater role in evaluation of the intracranial venous system.
   Review Summary: This review provides an overview of the current noninvasive methods and their applications and limitations, with examples of their use in a variety of disease processes. Computed tomography venography (CTV) is discussed as well as the various types of cerebral magnetic resonance venography (MRV).
   Conclusion: When available, MR supplemented with the technique of triggered gadolinium-enhanced MRV is the method of choice for the diagnosis of dural sinus thrombosis as well as most other pathologic entities affecting the intracranial venous system.

TI Effective Surgical Management of Competitive Venous Outflow Restriction
   After Radiosurgery for Cerebral AVMs: Report of 2 Cases
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex pathologies. For patients who do not present with hemorrhage, treatment strategies are often predicated on reducing the risk of hemorrhage and minimizing morbidity. Outcomes vary according to the efficacy of treatment selected. Radiosurgical treatment of certain AVMs can result in incomplete obliteration and may also have only a minimal effect on the presenting nonhemorrhagic symptoms.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We present 2 cases of patients with AVMs who were initially treated with radiosurgery. Both patients' primary clinical symptoms were headaches, which persisted after radiosurgical treatment but abated after subsequent microsurgical resection with or without endovascular embolization.
   CONCLUSION: Venous outflow obstruction is likely a sizable contributive factor in occipital AVMs among patients who present with headaches and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Because these high-flow lesions may be suboptimally responsive to stereotactic radiosurgery, microsurgical resection, with or without adjunctive endovascular embolization, should be considered as an initial and definitive treatment strategy. Optimal outcomes may be achieved in patients with a visual deficit that is anatomically correlated to their AVMs.

TI Effects of PEEP on the intracranial system of patients with head injury
   and subarachnoid hemorrhage: The role of respiratory system compliance
SO JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
CT 3rd International Update on Neuroanesthesia and Neuro Critical Care
CY SEP 12-14, 2002
CL Munchen, GERMANY
AB Background: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be effective in improving oxygenation, but it may worsen or induce intracranial hypertension. The authors hypothesized that the intracranial effects of PEEP could be related to the changes in respiratory system compliance (Crs).
   Methods. A prospective study investigated 21 comatose patients with severe head injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage receiving intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring who required mechanical ventilation and PEEP. The 13 patients with normal Crs were analyzed as group A and the 8 patients with low Crs as group B. During the study, 0, 5, 8, and 12 cm H2O of PEEP were applied in a random sequence. jugular pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral compliance, mean velocity of the middle cerebral arteries, and jugular oxygen saturation were evaluated simultaneously.
   Results: In the group A patients, the PEEP increase from 0 to 12 cm H2O significantly increased CVP (from 10.6 +/- 3.3 to 13.8 +/- 3.3 mm Hg; p < 0.001) and jugular pressure (from 16.6 +/- 3.1 to 18.8 +/- 3.2 mm Hg; p < 0.001), but reduced mean arterial pressure (from 96.3 +/- 6.7 to 91.3 +/- 6.5 mm Hg; p < 0.01), CPP (from 82.2 +/- 6.9 to 77.0 +/- 6.2 mm Hg; p < 0.01), and mean velocity of the middle cerebral arteries (from 73.1 +/- 27.9 to 67.4 +/- 27.1 cm/sec; F = 7.15; p < 0.001). No significant variation in these parameters was observed in group B patients. After the PEEP increase, ICP and cerebral compliance did not change in either group. Although jugular oxygen saturation decreased slightly, it in no case dropped below 50%.
   Conclusions. In patients with low Crs, PEEP has no significant effect on cerebral and systemic hemodynamics. Monitoring of Crs may be useful for avoiding deleterious effects of PEEP on the intracranial system of patients with normal Crs.

TI INTRATHORACIC PRESSURE REGULATION IMPROVES CEREBRAL PERFUSION AND
   CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW IN A PORCINE MODEL OF BRAIN INJURY
SO SHOCK
AB Brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in children and adults in their most productive years. Use of intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) to generate negative intrathoracic pressure during the expiratory phase of positive pressure ventilation improves mean arterial pressure and 24-h survival in porcine models of hemorrhagic shock and cardiac arrest and has been demonstrated to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in these models. Application of IPR for 240 min in a porcine model of intracranial hypertension (ICH) will increase CPP when compared with controls. Twenty-three female pigs were subjected to focal brain injury by insertion of an epidural Foley catheter inflated with 3 mL of saline. Animals were randomized to treatment for 240 min with IPR set to a negative expiratory phase pressure of -12 cmH(2)O or no IPR therapy. Intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, CPP, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were evaluated. Intrathoracic pressure regulation significantly improved mean CPP and CBF. Specifically, mean CPP after 90, 120, 180, and 240 min of IPR use was 43.7 +/- 2.8 mmHg, 44.0 +/- 2.7 mmHg, 44.5 +/- 2.8 mmHg, and 43.1 +/- 1.9 mmHg, respectively; a significant increase from ICH study baseline (39.5 +/- 1.7 mmHg) compared with control animals in which mean CPP was 36.7 +/- 1.4 mmHg (ICH study baseline) and then 35.9 +/- 2.1 mmHg, 33.7 +/- 2.8 mmHg, 33.9 +/- 3.0 mmHg, and 36.0 +/- 2.7 mmHg at 90, 120, 180, and 240 min, respectively (P < 0.05 for all time points). Cerebral blood flow, as measured by an invasive CBF probe, increased in the IPR group (34 +/- 4 mL/100 g-min to 49 +/- 7 mL/100 g-min at 90 min) but not in controls (27 +/- 1 mL/100 g-min to 25 +/- 5 mL/100 g-min at 90 min) (P = 0.01). Arterial pH remained unchanged during the entire period of IPR compared with baseline values and control values. In this anesthetized pig model of ICH, treatment with IPR significantly improved CPP and CBF. This therapy may be of clinical value by noninvasively improving cerebral perfusion in states of compromised cerebral perfusion.

TI Occipital venous sinus stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension
   and pulsatile tinnitus: A case series
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Venous sinus stenting for dural venous sinus outflow obstruction due to an intrinsic filling obstruction or extrinsic stenosis is an increasingly popular treatment strategy for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and isolated pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The most common site of stenosis is the lateral venous sinus at the transverse-sigmoid junction. Approximately 10% of the population has a persistent occipital venous sinus (OVS), a variant that may be the dominant venous drainage pathway in the setting of a hypoplastic or aplastic transverse sinus. OVS stenosis has been rarely associated with IIH and isolated PT with only a handful published cases. We herein report a retrospective series of OVS stenting in five patients, four of whom presented with non-IIH PT and one with IIH.

TI Consequences of the anatomy of deep venous outflow from the brain
SO NEURORADIOLOGY
AB The deep venous system is best defined as the entire territory sewed by the great vein of Galen and the basal veins. This comprises not only the choroid plexuses and the deep grey matter of the thalamus and striatum, but also the periventricular white matter and corpus callosum, hippocampus and the cortical areas of the limbic lobe including the cingulate and parahippocampal gyri, the visual cortex, the diencephalon and rostral brain stem, and part of the cerebellum. The superficial venous system comprises the remaining neocortex (with the cortex of the entire convexity) together with a layer of subcortical white matter? separated from the periventricular white matter by a venous watershed. Outflow towards the great vein of Galen and straight sinus can be substituted by collateral channels towards the basal vein. The basal vein in turn is connected not only to the great vein of Galen, but also to the superior petrosal sinus (via the lateral mesencephalic vein), and in the adult configuration to the cavernous sinus and pterygoid plexus (via the deep and superficial sylvian veins). Evidence from pa thological anatomy indicates that the venous watershed exists not only in the white matter of the hemispheres, but between the entire territories of the deep and superficial venous systems. Because of their anastomotic interconnections, only simultaneous obstruction of veins of Galen and basal veins wil effectively obstruct deep venous outflow. This can occur in the tentorial incisura, from swelling or displacement of the midbrain due to brain oedema, haematoma or tumour. Complete obstruction of great vein of Galen and basal veins leads to rapid death. In patients who survive incomplete obstruction, various combinations of damage to parts of the deep venous territory exist. This is possible because very many tributaries of the deep system unite below and sometimes above the tentorial incisura. The hallmarks these varying deep venous obstructions have in common are sparing of the subcortical white matter of the convexity, and cortical involvement limited to the limbic lobe and visual cortex. Obstruction of cerebral venous outflow explains many pathological phenomena. Treatment must aim at relieving this obstacle to blood flow.

AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a syndrome of unknown cause characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). A stenosis of the venous sinus is observed in many patients suffering from IIH. The role that this feature plays in the etiology of IIH has been a matter of dispute. A lumped-parameter model of intracranial pressure dynamics that accommodates venous sinus stenosis via a Starling-like resistor has been developed to study the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of IIH. In the absence of the Starling-like resistor, the system has a unique asymptotically-stable steady-state with normal pressures. With this type of resistor present, a second, asymptotically-stable steady-state may exist. This state is characterized by elevated ICP concurrent with a compressed venous sinus. It is hypothesized that IIH is a physiological manifestation of this elevated steady-state, that the primary cause of IIH is a compressible, as opposed to rigid, venous sinus, and that the observed stenosis is a necessary characteristic of the elevated steady-state. Simulations suggest a possible diagnostic technique for IIH, and the efficacy of various treatment options is examined. Results also indicate that the venous sinus stenosis may persist even after treatment has reduced the elevated ICP of IIH.

TI Subarachnoid hemorrhage following permissive hypercapnia in a patient
   with severe acute asthma
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB In this article, we describe a case of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in an acute severe asthma patient following mechanical hypoventilation. A 49-year-old man was admitted to an Intensive Care Unit with an acute exacerbation of asthma. After 3 days of mechanical ventilation (hypercapnia and normoxaemia), it was noted that his right pupil was fixed, dilated, and unreactive to light. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed localized SAH within the basilar cisterns and diffuse cerebral swelling. On the fourth day, a new CT scan showed hemorrhage resorption and a cerebral swelling decrease. In the following days, the patient's condition continued improving with no detectable neurological deficits. A review of similar published reports showed that all patients performed respiratory acidosis, normoxaemia, and hypercapnia. The most frequent neurological sign was mydriasis, and all subjects showed cerebral edema. Since normoxaemic hypercapnia has been associated with absence, or less cerebral edema, we considered additional factors to explain cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension causes. Thus, intrathoracic pressures due to patient's efforts by forcibly exhaling, or during mechanical ventilation, would further increase intracranial pressure by limiting cerebral venous drainage. This case emphasizes the fact that patients with acute severe asthma who have developed profoundly hypercarbic without hypoxia before or during mechanical ventilation, may have raised critical intracranial pressure.

TI The role of dural sinus stenosis in idiopathic intracranial hypertension
   pathogenesis: the self-limiting venous collapse feedback-loop model
SO PANMINERVA MEDICA
AB In recent years the efficacy of endovascular venous stenting in idiopathic IIH treatment has been consistently reported, strongly suggesting that sinus stenosis should be viewed as a causative factor rather than a secondary phenomenon. We propose that in subjects carrying one or more collapsible segments of large cerebral venous collectors and exposed to a number of different promoting factors, sinus venous compression and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypertension may influence each other in a circular way, leading to a new relatively stable venous/CSF pressures balance state at higher values. The mechanism relay on self-limiting venous collapse (SVC) feedback-loop between the CSF pressure, that compresses the sinus, and the consequent venous pressure rise, that increases the CSF pressure. The result is the "coupled" increase of both pressure values, a phenomenon not expected in presence of sufficiently rigid central veins. Once the maximum stretch of venous wall is reached the loop stabilize at higher venous/CSF pressure values and become self-sustaining, therefore persisting even after the ceasing of the promoting factor. Notably, the SVC is reversible provided an adequate perturbation is carried to whichever side of the loop such as sinus venous stenting, on one hand, and CSF diversion or even a single CSF withdrawal by lumbar puncture (LP), on the other. The SVC model predicts that any condition leading to an increase of either, cerebral venous pressure or CSF pressure may trigger the feedback loop in predisposed individuals. Migraine with and without aura, a disease sharing with IIH a much higher prevalence among women of childbearing age, is associated with waves of significant brain hyperperfusion. These may lead to the congestion of large cerebral venous collectors and could represent a common SVC promoting condition in susceptible individuals. The SVC model give reason of the high specificity and sensitivity of sinus stenosis as IIH predictor and of the multiplicity of the factors that have been found associated with IIH. Moreover it might explain why, among the sinus stenosis carriers, young and overweight women are at higher risk of developing the disease. Finally, the SVC model fully explain the enigmatic longstanding remissions that can be commonly observed after a single LP with CSF subtraction in IIH with or without papilledema.

TI Effects of duration of isoflurane anesthesia and mode of ventilation on
   intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures in horses
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Objective-To test the hypothesis that isoflurane-anesthetized horses during controlled ventilation and spontaneous ventilation exhibit temporal changes in cerebral hemodynamics, as measured by intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure, that reflect temporal changes in systemic arterial pressure.
   Animals-6 healthy adult horses.
   Procedure-Horses were anesthetized in left lateral recumbency with 1.57% isoflurane in O-2 for 5 hours in 2 experiments by use of either controlled ventilation (with normocapnia) or spontaneous ventilation (with hypercapnia) in a randomized crossover design. intracranial pressure was measured with a subarachnoid strain-gauge transducer. Carotid artery pressure, central venous pressure, airway pressures, blood gases, and minute ventilation also were measured.
   Results-intracranial pressure during controlled ventilation significantly increased during constant dose isoflurane anesthesia and thus contributed to decreasing cerebral perfusion pressure. Intracranial pressure was initially higher during spontaneous ventilation than during controlled ventilation, but this difference disappeared over time, no significant differences in cerebral perfusion pressures were observed between horses that had spontaneous or controlled ventilation.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Cerebral hemodynamics and their association with ventilation mode are altered over time in isoflurane-anesthetized horses and could contribute to decreased cerebral perfusion during prolonged anesthesia.

TI EXPERIMENTAL CARBON-DIOXIDE LASER BRAIN-LESIONS AND INTRACRANIAL
   DYNAMICS .3. EFFECT ON CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB Experimental carbon dioxide brain lesions were created over the intact dura mater of the left parietooccipital region of the anesthetized albino rabbit (40-watt impacts of 0.5-second duration, for a total of 4 seconds, with 0.5-second intervals between impacts), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies were performed with the hydrogen clearance technique. The animals were mechanically ventilated to maintain a constant PaCO2. Blood pressure, central venous pressure, electroencephalogram, and intracranial pressure were continuously monitored. The control CBF before lesion was 64.1 .+-. 15.8 and 70.9 .+-. 13.4 ml/100 g/minute for the left and the right hemispheres, respectively. CBF studies at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the lesion did not significantly change from the control values, save for a trend to increase over the right hemisphere only at 2 hours (range 106.0 .+-. 55.4 to 41.6 .+-. 9.3). It is concluded that in this model the changes in intracranial pressure and brain edema that are seen and have previously reported are not due to change in cerebral circulation. The brain edema that results probably has characteristics similar to those seen in the cryogenic lesion (vasogenic) model, and this could account for the rise in intracranial pressure.

TI MRI findings as markers of idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY
AB Purpose of review Negative findings on neuroimaging are part of the diagnostic criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), a syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Some positive neuroimaging findings are associated with increased ICP, but their role in diagnosis of IIH has not been established. We provide an overview of these findings and their relevance for diagnosis of raised intracranial pressure. Recent findings MRI acquisition techniques have significantly improved in the last few decades leading to better characterization of the intracranial changes associated with IIH, including empty sella turcica, optic nerve tortuosity, distension of the optic nerve sheath, posterior globe flattening, slit-like ventricles, and venous sinus stenosis. These may be MRI biomarkers of increased ICP. Prevalence difference between people with and without increased ICP, and reversibility of these MRI findings following treatment of increased ICP inform evaluation of their diagnostic potential. MRI and magnetic resonance venography findings are important tools in the diagnosis of IIH. Empty sella turcica, optic nerve protrusion, distension of the optic nerve sheath, optic nerve tortuosity, posterior globe flattening, and transverse sinus stenosis have been found to be the most promising diagnostic markers for IIH, although absence of these findings does not rule out the diagnosis.

TI Transverse Sinus Stenting for Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: A
   Review of 52 Patients and of Model Predictions
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transverse sinus stenosis is common in patients with IIH. While the role of transverse sinus stenosis in IIH pathogenesis remains controversial, modeling studies suggest that stent placement within a transverse sinus stenosis with a significant pressure gradient should decrease cerebral venous pressure, improve CSF resorption in the venous system, and thereby reduce intracranial (CSF) pressure, improving the symptoms of IIH and reducing papilledema. We aimed to determine if IIH could be reliably treated by stent placement in transverse sinus stenosis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical, venographic, and intracranial pressure data before and after stent placement in transverse sinus stenosis in 52 of our own patients with IIH unresponsive to maximum acceptable medical treatment, treated since 2001 and followed between 2 months and 9 years.
   RESULTS: Before stent placement, the mean superior sagittal sinus pressure was 34 mm Hg (462 mm H(2)0) with a mean transverse sinus stenosis gradient of 20 mm Hg. The mean lumbar CSF pressure before stent placement was 322 mm H(2)O. In all 52 patients, stent placement immediately eliminated the TSS pressure gradient, rapidly improved IIH symptoms, and abolished papilledema. In 6 patients, symptom relapse (headache) was associated with increased venous pressure and recurrent stenosis adjacent to the previous stent. In these cases, placement of another stent again removed the transverse sinus stenosis pressure gradient and improved symptoms. Of the 52 patients, 49 have been cured of all IIH symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a role for transverse sinus stent placement in the management of selected patients with IIH.

TI Asymptomatic idiopathic intracranial hypertension in young children
SO JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY
AB Presenting symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension arc, known to vary with age. Older children may complain of headache, neck pain, diplopia, intracranial noises, or transient visual observations. Younger children may present with apathy or irritability. This report describes three young children with no obvious relevant symptoms in whom papilledemia was newly found on routine follow-tip eye examination for unrelated problems. At presentation, all had early papilledema with negative cranial neuroimaging studies. All remained apparently asymptomatic, but the papilledema progressed. Sedated lumbar puncture showed elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure in all three. Two were felt to have truly idiopathic intracranial hypertension, whereas the third had jugular venous obstruction. The papilledemia responded to treatment with either acetazolamide or furosemide in all three. An apparent lack of symptoms does not rule out chronic increased intracranial pressure in young children.

Management at intensive care unit Was standardized. A standardized (short form 36 health survey) term and nonstandardized Split (questionnaire explored long-term outcome. Glutamic-oxaloacetic-transaminase, creatine kinase MB or glucose are markers for bad outcome (P < .05). Patients with cerebral perfusion pressure values below the recommended standard for just a single occurrence had significantly worse outcome (P = .0132). Mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and heart rate alone do not correlate with outcome. At least 1 occurrence of mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure below the lower limits resulted in a poor outcome (P = .035). Cerebral perfusion pressure-guided therapy seems to prevent further brain damage and results in outcome scores that are comparable to those children with head trauma exhibiting symptoms of mild brain edema.

TI Baloon angioplasty for venous sinus stenosis in a idiopathic

SO JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
AB The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a well characterised condition with intractable headaches, visual obscurations, and papilloedema as dominant features, mainly affecting obese women. With the advent of magnetic resonance (MR) venography and increased use of cerebral angiography, there has been recent emphasis on the significant number of patients with IIH found to have associated non-thrombotic dural venous sinus stenosis. This has led to a renewed interest in endovascular stenting and angioplasty as a treatment for IIH in patients non-responsive to medical treatment. We present a patient without known risk factors for IIH and non-responsive to treatment. The 19-year-old woman presented with headache and diplopia. She was diagnosed with IIH since she was five years of age and had been non-responsive to lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage and acetazolamide treatment. MR venography revealed thin calibration of transverse sinus. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) venous phase also revealed 50% stenosis of transverse sinus, 50% stenosis of left proximal sigmoid sinus and 90% stenosis of its distal part leading to obstruction of left transverse sinus outflow and forced directed drainage of left hemisphere to the anterior region.

TI A new neurosurgical adjustable pressure suction apparatus with a
   mechanically controlled air inlet: the study of precise regulation and
   atraumatic suction
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB BackgroundAn essential surgical tool in neurosurgery is the suction tube. The skillful and accurate use of a suction tube facilitates the neurosurgical operation. ObjectiveThis study is to verify the practicality of an adjustable pressure suction tube (APS tube) and to explore the ideal APS tube diameter and tip negative pressure for different intracranial structures. MethodsAPS tubes were used to aspirate brain tissues and carotid arteries of rats. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) was used to record the blood flow velocity (BFV). We measured APS tube diameter, air inlet size, tip negative pressure and central negative pressure and calculated the correlation between them. In our department, intraoperative real-time parameters including APS tube diameter, length, air inlet size, and central negative pressure were recorded, and the tube tip negative pressure suitable for different intracranial structures and parts was calculated. ResultsAll experiments were carried out using APS tubes. Experiments on rats objectively reflected a severe structural damage to the brain and blood vessels by the suction tube, which might even result in an irreversible reduction in blood flow., Rat carotid arteries and brain tissue suffered severe damage when the tip negative pressure exceeded 33.4 +/- 1.8 and 29.2 +/- 2.0 kPa, respectively. BFV failed to return to the preoperative level 3 min after the operation (p < 0.05), and this decrease was more pronounced when the suction tube diameter was large (p < 0.05). The tip negative pressure was positively and negatively correlated with central negative pressure and the air inlet size, and was independent of APS tube diameter. A total of 50 operations including 39 tumor resection operations and 11 moyamoya disease bypass operations were recorded. Large-diameter APS tubes (3.5 mm) with an closed air inlet were frequently used to maintain a greater tip negative pressure before the incision of dura mater. When important structures such as motor cortex and brainstem were involved, 1.5- or 2.0-mm-diameter APS tubes were mostly used, and an air inlet was opened up to 0.7-2.1 mm to maintain a safe tip negative pressure (7.4-27.9 kPa). ConclusionAPS tubes with a mechanical knob provide stable and precise adjustment of the tip negative pressure, avoiding excessive negative pressure that causes serious damage to the intracranial structure. And, this allows the surgeon to hold the suction tube more freely and operate at any angle with an appropriate fulcrum near the incision to achieve efficient atraumatic suction and enhance surgical safety.

TI Endovascular stenting of the transverse sinus in a patient presenting
   with benign intracranial hypertension
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB The authors present a 37-year-old lady with symptoms and signs suggestive of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). Routine CT and MRI scans were normal. Further investigations were performed with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and cerebral venography. These revealed obstruction of the right transverse sinus with high pressure (40 mmHg) proximal to the obstruction and low pressure (15 mmHg) distally. She was treated by transvenous stent deployment with resolution of her symptoms and the bilateral papilloedema. Evaluation of the cerebral venous system with MRV and or with formal cerebral venography should be included in routine investigations of patients with suspected BIH.

TI Case report: Novel transtemporal transverse sinus decompression surgery
   to alleviate transverse sinus stenosis in a pulsatile tinnitus patient
   with restricted bilateral venous outflow
SO FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
AB Transverse sinus (TS) stenosis is common in individuals with venous pulsatile tinnitus (PT). While PT can be addressed by endoluminal or extraluminal methods, the former has shown promise in alleviating symptoms associated with increased intracranial pressure. This study explores the potential of extraluminal methods to alleviate TS stenosis and eliminate PT caused by sigmoid sinus diverticulum. A 31-year-old male patient presenting with left-sided PT, attributed to a large, pedunculated sigmoid sinus diverticulum along with severe ipsilateral TS stenosis and contralateral TS hypoplasia, underwent ipsilateral extraluminal TS decompression surgery following sigmoid sinus wall reconstruction under local anesthesia. Postoperative CT and MR angiography revealed a significant increase in the TS lumen from 0.269 to 0.42 cm2 (56.02%) 2 years after surgery. Cervical Doppler ultrasound demonstrated a 36.07% increase in ipsilateral outflow volume to 16.6 g/s and a 77.63% increase in contralateral outflow volume to 1.35 g/s. In conclusion, this pioneering study showcases the potential of transtemporal TS decompression surgery in creating space for adaptive expansion of the TS lumen. However, the procedure should be reserved for individuals with severely compromised venous return.

TI Venous sinus stenting in patients without idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Venous sinus stenting is an effective treatment for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and venous sinus stenosis.
   Objective To determine the usefulness of venous sinus stenting in the treatment of patients with symptomatic venous sinus stenosis without a diagnosis of IIH.
   Methods We performed a retrospective review of a prospective multicenter database of patients undergoing venous sinus stenting between January 2008 and February 2016. Patients with acute dural venous sinus thrombosis, arteriovenous fistula or arteriovenous malformation, or IIH were excluded. Clinical, radiological, and ophthalmological information was recorded.
   Results Nine patients met the inclusion criteria and underwent venous sinus stenting for symptomatic dural venous sinus stenosis. Reasons for treatment included isolated unilateral pulsatile tinnitus (n=1), congenital hydrocephalus (n=2), unilateral pulsatile tinnitus following prior venous sinus thrombosis (n=1), acquired hydrocephalus following dural sinus thrombosis (n=2), meningitis (n=2) and tumor invasion into the dural venous sinus (n=1). Six patients underwent lumbar puncture or shunt tap, and all of these patients had elevated intracranial pressure. All stenoses were located in the transverse sinus, transverse-sigmoid junction and/or jugular bulb, and all were treated with self-expanding bare-metal stents. At follow-up, clinical symptoms had resolved in all but two patients, both of whom had congenital hydrocephalus and pre-existing shunts. There was no significant in-stent stenosis, and patients with ophthalmological follow-up demonstrated improvement of papilledema.
   Conclusions Dural venous sinus stenting may be an effective treatment for patients with symptomatic venous sinus stenosis without IIH in carefully selected cases, but may not be effective in resolving the symptoms of congenital hydrocephalus.

TI Papilloedema, an unusual complication of mastoidectomy
SO JOURNAL OF LARYNGOLOGY AND OTOLOGY
AB We report a very unusual case of a patient with a previously undiagnosed congenital absence of the left dural venous drainage system and a prominent system on the right. Due to its prominence it was at risk during a cortical mastoidectomy performed as part of an endolymphatic sac decompression procedure. Manipulation of the lateral venous sinus resulted in partial occlusion of the already compromised venous drainage. The result was a rise in intra-cranial pressure and papilloedema, from which the patient recovered. The abnormality was only detected on post-operative imaging.

TI Evidence of an active Cushing reflex in a preterm neonate with hyaline
   membrane disease: a case report
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
AB Background The Cushing reflex does not appear to have been described in preterm neonates. This case report shows the presence of an active Cushing reflex in a 32-week preterm neonate with hyaline membrane disease. Case presentation The 1.94 kg Caucasian infant was delivered by caesarean section following concerns about possible maternal infection and fetal compromise. Chest X-ray showed mild-to-moderate hyaline membrane disease and treatment was initiated with supplemental oxygen and nasal continuous positive airway pressure. It is probable that a pneumothorax occurred at 5-6 hours of age, with progression during the day. Interstitial air, pneumomediastinum, and tension pneumothorax were diagnosed on subsequent X-ray, and ultrasound of the brain showed a grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage. A review of the nurses' recordings of heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate showed a progressive increase in blood pressure accompanied by slowing of the heart rate and irregular respiration. These are features of the Cushing reflex that is elicited in response to raised intracranial pressure. Conclusion While well-described in older children and adults, in neonates the Cushing reflex has mainly been described in animal experiments and infants who have developed hydrocephalus. It is likely that in this case, the reflex was elicited as a result of a progressive increase in intracranial pressure due to the combination of elevated intrathoracic pressure, obstructed venous return from the brain, and concurrent intraventricular hemorrhage.

TI Coronary Stent for Right Transverse Venous Sinus Stenosis in a Patient
   With Symptomatic Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB A 59-year-old woman was referred to the neuro-interventional team with complaints of headache, papilledema, and visual disturbances. Imaging and Lumbar puncture revealed signs consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with stenosis of the right transverse venous sinus. The neurosurgery board chose to treat her with an endovascular approach and stenting. During the procedure, the right jugular vein revealed decreased blood flow. This led to a left jugular vein access through the confluence of venous dural sinuses. However, an incomplete confluence required the catheter to ascend the superior sagittal sinus before descending to the right transverse sinus. The carotid catheter system kept herniating up the SSS, risking rupture. Given the intraoperative findings and the available equipment, a more flexible coronary catheter system was chosen. This catheter device allowed plasty and successful stent deployment. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the patient was discharged. A follow-up MRI at five weeks showed signs of intracranial hypertension improvement and the patient reported Improvement in symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first time this type of device has been used in this anatomical location for this pathology.

TI Venous sinus manometry and intervention using the PrimeWire Prestige
   pressure guidewire: technique and initial experience
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background
   Cerebral venography and manometry are used for the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant venous sinus stenosis in patients with the syndrome of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Intravenous pressure measurements using the traditional microcatheter technique can be cumbersome, time consuming and potentially unreliable. The PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire conducts pressure electrically and can be used as a guidewire for intervention. It has been validated in interventional cardiology procedures.
   Objective
   We describe our initial clinical experience with the PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire system for cerebral venous manometry and intervention.
   Method
   Cerebral venous pressure gradient was directly measured by advancing the pressure wire across a region of stenosis. The pressure wire was also used as a guidewire for intravascular ultrasound, angioplasty and stenting.
   Results
   The PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire successfully navigated the intracranial venous sinus anatomy. Transfer of devices over the guidewire in a monorail fashion was uncomplicated, and measurement of sinus pressure between the steps of the intervention was efficiently performed.
   Conclusion
   The PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire system provided a safe, fast and effective method for intracranial venous sinus manometry and intervention. It has several potential advantages over the traditional microcatheter method, including efficiency, accuracy and cost.

TI Chiari Malformation Type 1 and Semi-Sitting Position-A Suitable
   Alternative for Patients with High BMI
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: Chiari I malformation results from a mismatch between the posterior fossa bones and neural components. Management usually relies on surgical treatment. Despite being the most common assumed positioning, the prone position can be challenging in high body mass index (BMI) patients (>40 kg/m(2)).METHODS: Between February 2020 and September 2021, 4 consecutive patients with class III obesity underwent posterior fossa decompression. The authors describe nuances of the positioning and perioperative detailsRESULTS: No perioperative complications were re-ported. These patients are at a lower risk of bleeding and increased intracranial pressure as a consequence of low intra-abdominal pressure and venous return. In this context, the semi-sitting position, with the aid of accurate monitoring for venous air embolism, seems to be an advantageous surgical position in this group of patients.CONCLUSIONS: We present our results and technicaluances on positioning high BMI patients for posterior fossa decompression using a semi-sitting position.

TI Intracranial pressure and cardiopulmonary variables during isoflurane or
   sevoflurane anesthesia at various minimum alveolar concentration
   multiples in normocapnic dogs
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Objective-To compere effects of isoflurane and sevoflurane on intracranial pressure and cardiovascular variables at 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 times the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) in mechanically ventilated normocapnic dogs.
   Animals-6 healthy male Beagles.
   Procedures-The individual MAC was determined for each agent with an electrical stimulus. After a minimum of 1 week, anesthetic induction by use of a mask with one of the inhalation anesthetics selected randomly was followed by mechanical ventilation and instrumentation for measurement of intracranial pressure and cardiovascular variables. Heart rate; systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial blood pressures; central venous pressure; mean pulmonary arterial pressure; pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; cardiac output; intracranial pressure (ICP); core body temperature; end-tidal inhalation anesthetic and carbon dioxide concentration; and arterial blood gas values were measured after attaining equilibrium at 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 MAC of each inhalation anesthetic. Cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were calculated.
   Results-Mean ICP did not differ within and between anesthetics at any MAC. Compared with equipotent concentrations of isoflurane, the CPP and mean values for systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial blood pressures were increased at 2.0 MAC for sevoflurane, whereas mean values for mean and diastolic arterial blood pressures and systemic vascular resistance were increased at 1.5 MAC for sevoflurane.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Although ICP was similar in healthy normocapnic dogs, CPP was better maintained during 2.0 MAC for sevoflurane, compared with isoflurane. (Am J Vet Res 2013;74:369-374)

AB Objective: To observe the repercussion of respiratory physiotherapy techniques on the mean arterial pressure (MBP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), jugular venous oxygen pressure (PjyO(2)) and jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjyO(2)). Method: The sample consisted of 20 patients with head trauma. The protocol consisted of physiotherapy techniques application of vibrocompression (VBC), expiratory flow increase (EFI) and suction. Results: The results show the maintenance on variables of cerebral hemodynamics during the techniques of VBC and EFI. However, in relation to suction, there was an increase of MBP, ICP, with maintenance of CPP, PjyO(2) and SjyO(2) and return to baseline of MBP and ICP 10 minutes after the end of suction. Conclusion: The respiratory physiotherapy techniques (VBC, EFI) do not promote cerebral hemodynamic repercussion, unlike suction, in severe head injury patients, mechanically ventilated, sedated and paralyzed.

TI Tissue Pressure Changes and Implications on Dressing Selection when
   utilising Negative Pressure Wound Therapy on an Ex Vivo Porcine Model
SO BURNS
AB Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is broadly used in surgical wound management and more recently burn care; however, the tissue pressure changes and best dressing application technique remains unknown. This study was done to help understand the tissue pressure changes beneath negative pressure when varying the delivered pressures, dressing thickness and distribution of dressings. This study was done in 2021 at a quaternary paediatric burns hospital. Utilising a cadaveric porcine model, an intracranial pressure monitor and transducer were used to assess pressure. The transducer was placed on the epidermis or inserted under ultrasound guidance via cannulation to the dermis, subcutaneous or muscular layer. Mepitel (TM), ACTICOAT (TM), varying layers of Kerlix (TM) (10, 20 or 30 layers) and NPWT were then applied either circumferentially or non-circumferentially. Each set of results is indicative of the intracranial pressure probe reading when NPWT was delivered at -40, -60, -80, -100 and -120 mmHg. The median and interquartile pressure recordings were epidermis: -42 (-42.5 - -41), -60.5 (-62.5 - -60), -80.5 (-82 - -80), - 99 (-99 - -98)mmHg (p < 0.001); dermis: 1 (0 - 2), 2 (1 - 3.5), 3 (2 - 5.5), 4 (3 - 7), 5.5 (4 - 7.5)mmHg (p < 0.001) (the increase in pressure was less when circumferential dressings (p < 0.001) or more layers of Kerlix were applied (p < 0.001)); subcutis: 1.5 (-4.5-1), -2.5 (-7.5 - 1.5), -3.5 (-11 - 1.5), -5 (-14 - 1.5) and -6 (-16 - 2)mmHg (p = 006) (the decrease in pressure was less with increased layers of Kerlix (0.047) and muscular: 0 (-0.5 - 0), 0 (-1 - 0.5), 0 (-1 - 1), 0 0 (-1 - 1), 00 (-1.5 - 1)mmHg (p = 0.55). These data suggest negative pressure paradoxically exerts a positive pressure on the dermis. Circumferential and multi-layer dressings reduce this positive pressure. This knowledge has impacted our burn negative pressure wound therapy dressing selection. The limitation of this study is the cadaveric model, a live model is suggested for future studies.

TI Pathogenesis and management of low-pressure hydrocephalus: A narrative
   review
SO JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Patients diagnosed with low-pressure hydrocephalus typically present with enlarged ventricles and unusually low intracranial pressure, often measuring below 5 cmH 2 O or even below atmospheric pressure. This atypical presentation often leads to low recognition and diagnostic rates. The development of low-pressure hydrocephalus is believed to be associated with a decrease in the viscoelasticity of brain tissue or separation between the ventricular and subarachnoid spaces. Risk factors for low-pressure hydrocephalus include subarachnoid hemorrhage, aqueduct stenosis, prior cranial radiotherapy , ventricular shunting, and cerebrospinal fluid leaks. For potential low-pressure hydrocephalus, diagnostic criteria include neurological symptoms related to hydrocephalus, an Evans index >0.3 on imaging, ICP <= 5 cm H- 2 O, symptom improvement with negative pressure drainage, and exclusion of ventriculomegaly caused by neurodegenerative diseases. The pathogenesis and pathophysiological features of low-pressure hydrocephalus differ significantly from other types of hydrocephalus, making it challenging to restore normal ventricular morphology through conventional drainage methods. The primary treatment options for low-pressure hydrocephalus involve negative pressure drainage and third ventriculostomy. With appropriate treatment, most patients can regain their previous neurological function. However, in most cases, permanent shunt surgery is still necessary. Low-pressure hydrocephalus is a rare condition with a high rate of underdiagnosis and mortality. Early identification and appropriate intervention are crucial in reducing complications and improving prognosis.

TI Brain perfusion abnormalities in patients with compromised venous
   outflow
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB Elevated intracranial intravenous pressure is not routinely measured in clinical practice. Indirect evidence of increased venous pressure is reflected in the size change of the cerebral sinuses and the presence of venous infarctions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of brain perfusion venous time-density curves in the diagnosis of cerebral venous hypertension. A retrospective review of four cases in which increased cerebral intravenous pressure was reflected in abnormal time-density curves on CT brain perfusion studies was completed. The abnormal venous time-density curves correlated with clinically increased intravenous pressure and normalized after treating the underlying pathology. Abnormal venous outflow affects brain perfusion. This could be identified on a CT brain-perfusion study based on characteristic venous time-density curves. These curves may appear quite similar even when the underlying etiologies are different. Normalization of the venous time-density curves may be observed after the underlying pathology was treated.

TI Endovascular treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension:
   retrospective analysis of immediate and long-term results in 51 patients
SO NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Purpose Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of any known causative factor. Sinus stenosis is common in these patients. Stenting of stenotic dural sinuses has gained popularity as a treatment option, since these stenoses may contribute to an obstruction of the venous return, and, thereby may contribute to IIH via an increase in venous sinus pressure. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment in IIH with venous sinus stenosis.
   Methods Fifty-one patients with IIH underwent stenting. Median age was 40 years. Clinical manifestation was headache in 74.5% of the patients and visual obscurations in 78.5%. Papilledema was present in 50/51 patients (98%), and lumbar puncture documented elevated CSF opening pressure in all but one patient (98%). Sinus stenoses were observed in all patients.
   Results Endovascular treatment was successfully performed in all patients. There were no major complications encountered (i.e., live threatening or causing a deterioration of a patient's condition equivalent to mRS 3-6). Improvement or resolution of papilledema was observed in 88% of the patients, and 84% reported improvement or resolution of the headache. Follow-up angiographies were performed in 48 patients at a median interval of 49 months and demonstrated in stent-stenosis or a de novo stenosis in 12 patients, eight of them needed re-treatment.
   Conclusion Venous sinus stenting is a safe and effective alternative to other invasive treatments (e.g., optic nerve sheath fenestration, CSF diversion) in patients with IIH. The majority of patients have a persistent clinical benefit.

TI MRI-Based Assessment of Acute Effect of Head-Down Tilt Position on
   Intracranial Hemodynamics and Hydrodynamics
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
AB Purpose: To quantify the acute effect of the head-down tilt (HDT) posture on intracranial hemodynamics and hydrodynamics.
   Materials and Methods: We evaluated the intracranial physiological parameters, blood flow-related parameters, and brain morphology in the HDT (-6 degrees and -12 degrees) and the horizontal supine (HS) positions. Seven and 15 healthy subjects were scanned for each position using 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging system. The peak-to-peak intracranial volume change, the peak-to-peak cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure gradient (PG(p-p)), and the intracranial compliance index were calculated from the blood and CSF flow determined using a cine phase-contrast technique. The brain volumetry was conducted using SPM12. The measurements were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test or a paired t-test.
   Results: No measurements changed in the -6 degrees HDT. The PG(p-p) and venous outflow of the internal jugular veins (IJVs) in the -12 degrees HDT were significantly increased compared to the HS (P < 0.001 and P = 0.025, respectively). The cross-sectional areas of the IJVs were significantly larger (P < 0.001), and the maximum, minimum, and mean blood flow velocity of the IJVs were significantly decreased (P = 0.003, < 0.001, and = 0.001, respectively) in the -12 degrees HDT. The mean blood flow velocities of the internal carotid arteries were decreased (P = 0.023). Neither position affected the brain volume.
   Conclusion: Pressure gradient and venous outflow were increased in accordance with the elevation of the intracranial pressure as an acute effect of the HDT. However, the CSF was not constantly shifted from the spinal canal to the cranium.

TI Case report: Successful thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin in a pregnant
   woman with internal jugular vein agenesis
SO FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB Internal jugular agenesis is a vascular malformation that is often associated with a history of recurrent headache. Due to the resulting abnormalities in intracranial venous drainage, it may be complicated by neurological dysfunction, such as intracranial hypertension, intracranial micro-thromboses, and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The simultaneous presence of jugular vein agenesis and thrombosis is possible in cases of acute illness, hormonal treatment, pregnancy, hypomobility, or venous drainage abnormalities (VDA) (e.g., May-Thurner syndrome). In particular, the literature still lacks data on thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with jugular vein agenesis. Here, we report a positive experience with prophylaxis using enoxaparin during pregnancy in a patient with internal jugular agenesis.

TI Role of Resistivity Index Analysis in the Prediction of Hemodynamically
   Significant Venous Sinus Stenosis in Patient With Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: The resistivity index (RI) in cerebral venous sinus stenosis (VSS) has not been studied in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of RI measured by quantitative magnetic resonance venogram (QMRV) as a noninvasive tool in the diagnosis of venous hypertension associated with VSS in IIH.
   METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of 13 consecutive IIH patients who underwent venous sinus stenting at our institution between 2013 and 2018. Patients' demographics, clinical presentation, cerebral mean venous sinus pressure (MVP), and RI both pre- and poststenting were recorded. The baseline RI was also compared to a control group.
   RESULTS: Among 13 patients of IIH, 11 had unilateral VSS in dominant sinus, whereas 2 had bilateral VSS. RI was significantly higher in IIH patients compared to the control group in the superior sagittal (SSS) and transverse sinuses (TS) (0.21 vs 0.11, P = .01 and 0.22 vs 0.13, P = .03, respectively). The MVP (in mm Hg) decreased significantly after venous sinus stenting in the SSS (41.9 to 22.5, P < .001) and TS (39.4 to 19.5, P < .001), which was also associated with a significant reduction of the RI (0.22 vs 0.17, P < .01 in SSS and 0.23 vs 0.17, P = .03 in TS) poststenting.
   CONCLUSION: RI calculated using QMRV can serve as a noninvasive tool to aid in the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant VSS. The study had a small sample size, and larger multicenter studies would be required to validate the results further.

TI Abnormal venous drainage in syndromic craniosynostosis and the role of
   CT venography
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Venous hypertension is emerging as a significant contributor to intracranial pressure in children with syndromic craniosysnostosis. This is associated with jugular foramen stenosis or atresia and with the development of collateral emissary veins. We demonstrate how computed tomography venography can document the prevalence of these emissary veins and how their visualisation plays an important role in operative planning.
   Patients with known syndromic craniosynostosis underwent computed tomography venography as part of their routine pre-operative evaluation. The venous drainage pattern was examined in these patients, with a special note of the presence of abnormal venous pathways.
   Eleven patients were recruited into the study from ages 3 months to 22 years. All had a diagnosis of syndromic craniosynostosis with six Crouzon's, four Pfeiffer's and one patient with Crouzon's and acanthosis nigricans. Nine of 11 patients had demonstrable evidences of transosseous venous drainage through an identifiable abnormal emissary vein. Four of 11 had a transosseous route as the main mechanism of drainage for the cerebral venous system.
   Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis often demonstrate abnormal venous anatomy, which can have serious consequences on craniofacial surgery, especially when a posterior decompression is being considered. Based on these findings, the authors assert that those children with some syndromic craniosynostosis being considered for surgery should undergo venographic studies as part of their pre-operative evaluation.

TI Venous Sinus Stenting using Transcranial Access for the Treatment of
   Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension in a Pediatric Patient
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCES IN RURAL PRACTICE
AB A 4-year-old male with headaches, papilledema, intracranial hypertension, and bilateral transverse sinus (TS) stenosis underwent attempted percutaneous placement of a right TS stent. Stent deployment was not technically feasible due to the stiffness of the stent and tortuosity of the patient's jugular bulb. Therefore, the patient underwent hybrid endovascular stenting of the right TS using neuronavigation and direct access of the TS following a single burr hole craniectomy. Two Express 8 mm x 17 mm balloon-mounted stents were deployed into the right TS, which resulted in obliteration of the preexisting trans-stenosis pressure gradient and decreased intracranial parenchymal pressure as monitored through an intracranial pressure bolt. The patient's headaches and papilledema resolved, and follow-up imaging demonstrated no in-stent or stent-adjacent stenosis. This case demonstrates the feasibility of combining minimally invasive open surgical access to allow direct cannulation for venous sinus stenting.

TI The effects of indomethacin on intracranial pressure and cerebral
   hemodynamics during isoflurane or propofol anesthesia in sheep with
   intracranial hypertension
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB The effect of indomethacin in reducing intracranial pressure (ICP) may be dependent on the choice of anesthetic regimen. We studied the effects of indomethacin on ICP and cerebral blood flow (CBF) during isoflurane or propofol anesthesia in a sheep model of intracranial hypertension. A crossover design was applied in which six sheep were anesthetized with isoflurane and propofol in a random order. Anesthetic depth was measured with response and state entropy. Changes in CBF, ICP, mean arterial blood pressure, arterio-venous oxygen difference, and Paco(2) were measured at specific times before and after an IV indomethacin bolus (0.2 mg/kg). Response and state entropy values during anesthesia were similar in both groups. Isoflurane and propofol reduced CBF by 11% and 34%, respectively. Indomethacin caused a reduction in ICP within 15 s during both anesthetic regimens, with the decrease in ICP being significantly more pronounced during isoflurane (P = 0.009). In both anesthetic groups, indomethacin caused a simultaneous increase in mean arterial blood pressure and a further 17% versus 14% decrease in CBF from predrug values for isoflurane and propofol, respectively. The reduction in CBF was significantly more pronounced for propofol (P = 0.02). The effect on ICP, however, was most pronounced during isoflurane anesthesia. We suggest that the effect of indomethacin is partly mediated by an autoregulatory response.

TI More Than Meets The Eye? Redefining Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease of unknown etiology associated with increased intracranial pressure, predominantly affecting obese females of childbearing age. The history of IIH is quite unique, featuring only limited advancements in evidenced-based treatments, but boasting literally countless changes in nomenclature, proposed etiology, and conceptual approach. Despite its elusive pathogenesis, an evolution of our approach to IIH can be traced sequentially through identifiable periods. Contemporary research suggests that we are approaching a new phase in IIH, redefining it as a global neurologic syndrome with more far-reaching effects than previously realized.

TI Intra-abdominal hypertension - Implications for the intensive care
   physician
SO ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
AB Introduction: Intra-abdominal hypertension is becoming increasingly recognised in intensive care patients. The objective of this paper was to review the modern published literature to establish a representative consensus view of the incidence, causes, pathophysiology, management and outcome of intra-abdominal hypertension. Methods: A computerised MEDLINE search from 1966 to November 2000 was conducted using the Medical Subject Heading and textwords "abdominal", "compartment syndromes', "intra-abdominal" and "hypertension" and "pressure". The references of recent articles were checked for additional relevant citations. Papers were independently assessed for relevance by authors SJR and GMJ using a data collection format. Data were assessed qualitatively and papers detailing physiologic variables, effects of decompression and outcome were abstracted in table form. Conclusions: Intra-abdominal hypertension exists when intra-abdominal pressure exceeds 10 to 12 mmHg as physiological aberrations are manifest above this pressure. Incidence is 5% to 40% in high-risk surgical patients. Pathophysiological changes caused by intra-abdominal hypertension include effects on the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, respiratory and central nervous systems. An association between intra-abdominal hypertension and subsequent multiple organ failure has been repeatedly shown, although causation remains unproven. Monitoring intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) by measuring urinary bladder pressure is easy and accurate. However, it is unclear what level of intra-abdominal pressure requires intervention (decompression), or what length of time intra-abdominal hypertension can be tolerated before significant end organ damage occurs. In the absence of good outcome data, expert consensus is that an acute increase of IAP to above 20 to 25 mmHg and/or evidence of abdominal compartment syndrome warrants urgent decompression. While some progress has been made in describing and managing this clinical entity, further studies are needed to fully understand the clinical implications and confirm appropriate management of this condition.

TI Primary balloon angioplasty of venous Sinus stenosis in idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Background Venous sinus stenosis (VSS) stenting has emerged as an effective treatment for patients with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH). However, stenting carries risk of in-stent stenosis/thrombosis and cumulative bleeding risk from long-term dual antiplatelet (DAPT) use. Thus, we investigated the potential safety and efficacy of primary balloon angioplasty as an alternative to stenting in IIH. Methods A prospectively maintained single-center registry of IIH patients undergoing endovascular procedures was queried. Inclusion criteria included patients with confirmed IIH and angiographically demonstrable VSS who underwent interventions from 2012- 2021. Patients were dichotomized into primary balloon angioplasty (Group A) and primary stenting (Group S), comparing clinical outcomes using bivariate analyses. Results 62 patients were included with median age of 33 [IQR 26-37], 74% females. Group A (9/62) and Group S (53/62) had similar baseline characteristics. Papilledema improvement was higher in Group S at 6 weeks and 6 months (44 vs. 93, p = 0.002 and 44 vs. 92%, p = 0.004), with similar improvements across all symptoms. Group S had higher mean post-procedure venous pressure gradient change (8 vs. 3 mmHg, p = 0.02) and a lower CSF opening pressure at 6 months (23 vs. 36 cmH2O, p < 0.001). VPS rescue rate was higher in Group A (44 vs. 2%, p = 0.001). There was only one procedural complications; a subdural hematoma in Group A. Conclusions Primary VSS balloon angioplasty provides a marginal and short-lived improvement of IIH symptoms compared to stenting. These findings suggest a cautious and limited role for short-term rescue angioplasty in poor shunting and stenting candidates with refractory IIH.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension following spinal deformity surgery
   in children
SO NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) after pediatric spinal deformity surgery has not been previously reported. The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of more than 1500 pediatric spinal surgeries performed between 1992 and 2011. From their analysis, they report on 3 adolescent patients who underwent uncomplicated segmental spinal instrumentation for pediatric spinal deformity correction and subsequently developed features of IIH. The common variables in these 3 patients were adolescent age, spinal deformity, being overweight, symptom onset within 2 weeks postoperatively, significant estimated blood loss, and intraoperative use of e-aminocaproic acid (antifibrinolytic) injection. The authors postulate that the development of IIH could be the result of venous outflow obstruction due to derangement of the epidural venous plexus during surgery. The use of e-aminocaproic acid could potentially have the risk of causing IIH, probably mediated through hyperfibrinogenemia, although there have not been published cases in the neurosurgical, orthopedic, cardiac, or general surgical literature. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension after spinal deformity correction is a condition that should be recognized by neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons, because appropriate intervention with early medical therapy can lead to a satisfactory clinical outcome.

TI A unifying hypothesis for hydrocephalus and the Chiari malformations
   part two: The hydrocephalus filling mechanism
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB It is proposed that negative central nervous system (CNS) pressure is one of the filling mechanisms of the fluid spaces of the CNS. Negative CNS pressure is caused by the combination of gravitational force and body movement. The venous system imposes pressure fluctuations on the CNS due to changes in posture and body cavity pressure. It is proposed here that filling of veins, arteries and cerebrospinal (CSF) spaces are all assisted by negative CNS pressure. Hyperemia in the CNS in response to pressure changes with movement was described in the first part of this hypothesis. By this means parenchyma water levels may increase (Williams, 2008). In the developmental forms of hydrocephalus expansion of CSF spaces is a more prominent feature than parenchyma water changes. This feature is explained by this second part of the hypothesis where the negative pulsatility of pressure that can accompany positive pressure pulsatility, which occurs with body movement, is described as the pathological force that leads to cavity filling. When CNS compliance is lost there is overrepresentation of low and well as high pressure pulsations in response to body movements. Pressure that leads to the development of hydrocephalus can be described as being abnormally labile. Negative CNS pressure causes cavity filling in an analogous way to pleural cavity filling, with water passing from parenchyma tissue. Positive pressure within the pressure profile may cause expansion of regions of the CNS skeletal system that are able to grow such as the cranial vault so that large head size is a frequent accompaniment to hydrocephalus that is caused by this mechanism. Hydrocephalic disorders that are characterised by negative pressure filling mechanism often have a skeletal anatomical abnormality that causes reduced CNS compliance and adversely affect neural development. This is often in the form of obstruction to CSF flow around the base of the brain that then leads to vault expansion by means of high pressure pulsation and ventricle enlargement by means of low pressure pulsation. In health pressure pulsatility does not lead to enduring changes in water distribution within the CNS compartments but it assists physiological water balance. (C) 2016 The Author.

   VOLUNTEERS
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Although sufentanil is frequently used in neuroanesthesia, the effect of the drug on intracranial pressure is still controversial.  In our study, we used an invasive measurement technique to study the effects of 0.1 mug/kg-1 sufentanil on mean lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), central venous pressure (CVP), heart rate (HR), and end-tidal dioxide (ETco2) in five human volunteers.  After i.v. injection of sufentanil, mean lumbar CSFP increased from 6 mm Hg to 12 mm Hg (p < 0.05), and mean CPP decreased from 92 mm Hg to 78 mm Hg (p < 0.05), whereas MAP, CVP, HR, and ETco2 remained stable.  The results of this study clearly show that even a low dose of sufentanil transiently increases lumbar CSFP in volunteers with uncompromised intracranial compliance.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
AB Extradural drainage systems connected to a vacuum device for preventing postoperative haematoma formation are often used in neurosurgical practice. Cardiovascular complications, including bradycardia or low arterial pressure caused by intracranial hypotension, have been described associated with their use. We have investigated the relationship between the negative pressure applied to extradural drainage systems and intracranial pressure (ICP), and analysed the effects of negative pressure of the drains on systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean (MAP) arterial pressures and on heart rate (HR). We studied prospectively 15 patients undergoing neurosurgery for supratentorial tumours or aneurysms. Transient decreases in ICP (P<0.001) and HR (P<0.001), with no clinical effects, were observed after connecting the vacuum device to the drain. There were no significant changes in SAP, DAP or MAP.

TI EFFECT OF DIAMOX ON INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE AND BLOOD VOLUME
SO NEUROLOGY
AB A method is described for thevivo determination of intracranial blood volume. In adult cats, intravenous Diamox ( 150 mg/kg) produced a bimodal increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure, 1 peak occurring 1 minute following administration, and the other peak occurring 8 to 10 minutes following administration. The 1st pressure peak is associated with an increase in arterial and venous pressures and an increased intracranial blood volume. The 2nd pressure peak is associated with falling arterial and venous pressures and an intracranial blood volume near the control values. An increase in total blood volume, as determined by a radio-iodinated human serum albumin dilution technic, was observed reaching a maximum 20 minutes following Diamox administration and remaining elevated for another 40 minutes. A 10% increase in hematocrit was observed, following approximately the same time course as the total blood volume. Parenteral Diamox would thus appear to be ineffective and potentially dangerous in the presence of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure.

TI Intracranial hypertension due to spinal cord tumor misdiagnosed as
   pseudotumor cerebri syndrome: case report
SO BMC NEUROLOGY
AB Background Isolated onset of intracranial hypertension due to spinal cord tumor is rare, thus, easily leading to misdiagnosis and delay in effective treatment. Case presentation Herein, we describe a 45-year-old female patient who manifested isolated symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension and whose condition was initially diagnosed as idiopathic intracranial hypertension and transverse sinus stenosis. The patient received a stent implantation; however, no improvements were observed. One year later her symptoms exacerbated, and during rehospitalization a spinal imaging examination revealed a lumbar tumor. Pathologic evaluation confirmed schwannoma, and tumor resection significantly improved her symptoms, except for poor vision. Conclusions Space-occupying lesions of the spine should be considered in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, even in the absence of spine-localized signs or symptoms.

TI Changes in venous drainage after posterior cranial vault distraction and
   foramen magnum decompression in syndromic craniosynostosis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB OBJECTIVE The authors' objective was to measure the effect of posterior cranial vault distraction (PCVD) plus foramen magnum decompression (FMD) on dural sinus volume and venous flow in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis. METHODS The volumes of the sagittal, straight, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses of 5 consecutive patients with syndromic craniosynostosis who underwent PCVD+FMD were calculated in cubic centimeters with T2-weighted volumetric MRI sequences before surgery, immediately after surgery, and after the end of the distraction process. Tridimensional reconstructions of phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography (PC-MRA) images were obtained with multiplanar reconstruction (MPR). RESULTS The average total volume of all dural sinuses increased immediately after surgery (from 10.06 cm(3) to 12.64 cm(3)) and continued to increase throughout the 30-day distraction period (from 12.64 cm(3) to 14.71 cm(3)) (p = 0.04), except that the right sigmoid sinus remained stable after the initial increase. The most important increases were observed for the left transverse sinus (+113.2%), right transverse sinus (+104.3%), left sigmoid sinus (+91.3%), and sagittal sinus (+41.8%). Less important modifications were evident for the right sigmoid sinus (+33.7%) and straight sinus (+23.4%). Significant improvements in venous flow were noted on the tridimensional reconstructions of the PC-MRA images. Venous obstruction grading score improved in 4 patients (average [range] 2.4 [ 2-5]) (p = 0.023) and remained stable in 1 patient. All patients had chronic tonsillar herniation (CTH) (mean [range] 16.6 [8-26] mm), and 3 had syringomyelia. CTH showed improvement on the last follow-up MRI evaluation in 4 patients (mean [range] 10.5 [0-25] mm) and worsened from 15 mm to 19 mm in 1 patient. Syringomyelia improved in 2 patients and remained unchanged in 1. CONCLUSIONS This study has provided the first radiological evidence of the impact of craniofacial surgery on dural sinus anatomy and venous drainage. The venous anomalies described in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis are not static, and PCVD+FMD triggers a dynamic process that can lead to significant modifications of intracranial venous drainage. The traction exerted by the distracted bone flap onto the occipitoparietal dura mater adherent to the inner calvaria may account for the enlargement of the dural sinus throughout the distraction period. The impact of these modifications on venous pressure, intracranial pressure, CTH, and hydrocephalus remains to be determined.

TI Factors Influencing Favourable Clinical Outcomes in Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension with Venous Sinus Stenosis Stenting
SO CLINICAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB PurposeThis study aimed to investigate the factors influencing favourable clinical outcomes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients with venous sinus stenosis (VSS) who received stenting treatment.MethodsIn this prospective cohort study, we analyzed a total of 172 IIH patients with VSS treated with venous sinus stenting. Clinical outcomes were categorized as either "complete resolved" or "improved". We employed multivariable logistic regression modeling to identify independent factors associated with the clinical outcomes. The predictive accuracy of the model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.ResultsOut of the total cohort, 126 patients exhibited asymptomatic clinical outcomes, while 46 patients showed improved clinical outcomes. Patients with asymptomatic clinical outcomes demonstrated notably lower preoperative BMI (26.8 kg/m2 versus 28.7 kg/m2, P = 0.013). In multivariate analysis, preoperative BMI (odds ratio [OR] = 1.108, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.009-1.216) was an independent factor of complete resolution of the symptoms. In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the identified cut-off BMI for the highest sensitivity (0.5) and specificity (0.754) was determined to be 29.3 kg/m2.ConclusionLower BMI may be associated with the complete resolution of symptoms in IIH patients with VSS who received venous sinus stenting treatment.

SO BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA
AB This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of hypertonic saline (HS) in treating Chinese mainland populations with high intracranial pressure (HIP). The PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Elsevier, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases were searched for all randomized controlled trials of HS used to treat Chinese mainland populations with HIP for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were then calculated. A total of eight randomized controlled trials that studied a total of 567 cases were included. The results showed that compared with the control groups, the MD values of intracranial pressure in the HS groups 1 and 3 hours after administering the medication were 0.00 (95% CI: -0.30-0.30) and -0.23 (95% CI: -0.73-0.26), respectively, and no significant difference was apparent; the MD values of mean arterial pressure and mean venous pressure 1 and 3 hours after administering the medication also showed no significant difference. HS had the same effectiveness in lowering intracranial pressure and changing the hemodynamic features as other treatment options.

TI Correlation between angiographic stenosis and physiologic venous sinus
   outflow obstruction in idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Introduction The relationship between degree of angiographic venous sinus stenosis and the trans-stenosis pressure gradient magnitude in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is poorly understood. The present study aimed to assess the utility of angiography, venography, and non-invasive imaging (MRV or CTV) for the diagnosis and characterization of clinically significant VSS. Methods Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database was performed to identify patients with medically refractory IIH who were evaluated by angiography and venous manometry for the presence of VSS with associated clinically significant pressure gradient. Angiographic stenosis was measured by two independent raters using novel methodology. Results Thirty-seven patients met inclusion criteria for the study. In total, 70% of patients had clinically significant pressure gradients and were selected for stenting. The optimal percentage stenosis for detection of a significant pressure gradient was 34% stenosis on venous phase arteriography (sensitivity 0.81 and specificity 0.91) and 31% stenosis on venography (0.92 and 0.73). For every 10% increase in stenosis, an approximate increase in pressure gradient of 3.5 mmHg is seen. MRV/CTV had a calculated sensitivity of 0.42, and a negative predictive value of 22%. Conclusion The degree of stenosis predictive of a clinically significant pressure gradient (30-35%) in the venous sinuses is considerably lower than the arterial stenosis at which pathologic hemodynamic alterations occur. While highly predictive of a venous pressure gradient when a stenosis is identified, non-invasive imaging does not appear to be a suitable diagnostic evaluation for the purpose of ruling out clinically significant cerebral VSS.

TI Safety and efficacy of intravascular ultrasound as an adjunct to
   stenting for cerebral venous sinus stenosis-induced idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension: a pilot study
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE Symptomatic intracranial hypertension can be caused by cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS) and cerebral venous sinus thrombotic (CVST) stenosis, which is usually found in some patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Recently, at the authors' center, they utilized intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) as an adjunct to conventional venoplasty or stenting to facilitate diagnosis and accurate stent placement in CVSS.
   METHODS The authors designed a retrospective review of their prospective database of patients who underwent IVUS-guided venous sinus stenting between April 2016 and February 2017. Clinical, radiological, and ophthalmological information was recorded and analyzed. IVUS was performed in 12 patients with IIH (9 with nonthrombotic CVSS, 3 with secondary stenosis combined with CVST) during venoplasty through venous access. The IVUS catheter was used from a proximal location to the site of stenosis. Post-stenting follow-up, including symptomatic improvement, stent patency, and adjacent-site stenosis, was assessed at 1 year.
   RESULTS Thirteen stenotic cerebral sinuses in 12 patients were corrected using IVUS-guided stenting. No technical or neurological complications were encountered. The IVUS images were excellent for the diagnosis of the stenosis, and intraluminal thrombi were clearly visualized by using IVUS in 3 (25%) of the 12 patients. A giant arachnoid granulation was demonstrated in 1 (8.3%) of the 12 patients. Intravenous compartments or septations (2 of 12, 16.7%) and vessel wall thickening (6 of 12, 50%) were also noted. At 1-year follow-up, 10 of 12 patients were clinically symptom-free in our series.
   CONCLUSIONS IVUS is a promising tool with the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy in IIH, aiding in identification of the types of intracranial venous stenosis, assisting in stent selection, and guiding stent placement. Further study of the utility of IVUS in venous stenting and venous stenosis pathology is warranted.

TI Pathogenesis and Management in Cerebrovenous Outflow Disorders
SO AGING AND DISEASE
AB In keeping with its status as one of the major causes of disability and mortality worldwide, brain damage induced by cerebral arterial disease has been the subject of several decades of scientific investigation, which has resulted in a vastly improved understanding of its pathogenesis. Brain injury mediated by venous etiologies, however, such as cerebral, jugular, and vertebral venous outflow disturbance, have been largely ignored by clinicians. Unfortunately, this inattention is not proportional to the severity of cerebral venous diseases, as the impact they exact on the quality of life of affected patients may be no less than that of arterial diseases. This is evident in disease sequelae such as cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)-mediated visual impairment, epilepsy, and intracranial hypertension; and the long-term unbearable head noise, tinnitus, headache, dizziness, sleeping disorder, and even severe intracranial hypertension induced by non-thrombotic cerebral venous sinus (CVS) stenosis and/or internal jugular venous (IJV) stenosis. In addition, the vertebral venous system (VVS), a large volume, valveless vascular network that stretches from the brain to the pelvis, provides a conduit for diffuse transmission of tumors, infections, or emboli, with potentially devastating clinical consequences. Moreover, the lack of specific features and focal neurologic signs seen with arterial etiologies render cerebral venous disease prone to both to misdiagnoses and missed diagnoses. It is therefore imperative that awareness be raised, and that as comprehensive an understanding as possible of these issues be cultivated. In this review, we attempt to facilitate these goals by systematically summarizing recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of these entities, including CVT, CVS stenosis, and IJV stenosis, with the aim of providing a valid, practical reference for clinicians.

TI Optic nerve sheath fenestration for visual impairment in cerebral venous
   diseases
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB ObjectiveVisual impairment is the most common clinical feature of cerebral venous sinus occlusion or cerebral venous thrombosis-induced intracranial hypertension, which can result in optic atrophy, leading to irreversible vision loss, visual field defections, and finally, permanent blindness. Papilledema is a typical early pathophysiological alteration in visual impairment. Optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) has become increasingly accepted as an option to prevent or halt progressive visual loss owing to its low risk and complications. The objective of this study is to review the latest research progress on ONSF for the treatment of visual impairment related to cerebral venous diseases. MethodsStudy were searched following PRISMA guidelines based on three electronic databases (Pubmed, Embase and Medline-Ovid). We used the following keywords and variations as keywords to identify studies: "optic nerve sheath fenestration, papilledema, cerebral venous diseases, cerebral venous stenosis, cerebral venous thrombosis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension". The publication date of studies was restricted between 1,872.1.1 and 2,021.12.31. The application of ONSF in papilledema due to cerebral venous diseases is reviewed. Additionally, the common surgical approaches as well as advantages and disadvantages are also described graphically. ResultsWith the improvement of specific details of the ONSF procedure and surgical instruments, complications of ONSF have reduced and its safety has been significantly improved, although the number of clinically investigated cases in the literature remains low. ConclusionWe recommend that ONSF should be considered as an imperative alternative to reduce or delay the visual morbidity of cerebral venous diseases, although there is yet no consensus on the optimal surgical timing.

TI Cerebral Venous Sinus Stenting for the Treatment of Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension in a Child
SO BRAZILIAN NEUROSURGERY-ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE NEUROCIRURGIA
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease characterized by an increase in the opening pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) associated with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). The condition is more prevalent in women and typically managed clinically. Surgical treatment is reserved for select refractory cases. The well-established surgical procedures for the management of IIH are CSF shunting and fenestration of the optic nerve sheath. These procedures, however, are associated with high rates of complication and recurrence.
   More recently, venous sinus angioplasty with stents has been employed in cases with documented narrowing of the sigmoid-transverse sinuses. This technique is associated with a significant reduction in the venous pressure gradient at the stenosis site, alleviating the symptoms of intracranial hypertension.
   We report a case of a previously healthy 12-year-old patient who presented with 10-day history of headaches, blurring of vision, nausea and vomiting, which evolved with worsening of the visual acuity and papilledema. Imaging scans disclosed stenosis of the right transverse and sigmoid sinuses. The patient underwent stenting of the stenotic venous segments and showed good evolution, with significant clinical improvement within 24 hours of the procedure.

TI RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DOPAMINE INFUSIONS AND INTRACRANIAL HEMODYNAMICS
   IN PATIENTS WITH RAISED INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE
SO CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
AB Dopamine, 1-10-mu-g/kg body weight/min was infused in 6 patients suffering from cerebrovascular diseases with elevated intracranial pressure and a critical cerebral perfusion pressure. Dopamine decreased intracranial pressure in 3 and increased it moderately in the other 3 patients. In all patients, the dopamine-induced rise of mean arterial pressure led to an increase of cerebral perfusion pressure. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic recordings of the middle cerebral artery in patients whose intracranial pressure declined revealed a decrease of the pathologically elevated cerebrovascular resistance, and an augmentation of cerebral blood supply. In conclusion, dopamine infusions may improve cerebral hemodynamics in some patients with severe brain edema. Such patients can be identified by intracranial pressure and Doppler monitoring.

TI Monro-Kellie 2.0: The dynamic vascular and venous pathophysiological
   components of intracranial pressure
SO JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM
AB For 200 years, the 'closed box' analogy of intracranial pressure (ICP) has underpinned neurosurgery and neuro-critical care. Cushing conceptualised the Monro-Kellie doctrine stating that a change in blood, brain or CSF volume resulted in reciprocal changes in one or both of the other two. When not possible, attempts to increase a volume further increase ICP. On this doctrine's "truth or relative untruth'' depends many of the critical procedures in the surgery of the central nervous system. However, each volume component may not deserve the equal weighting this static concept implies. The slow production of CSF (0.35 ml/min) is dwarfed by the dynamic blood in and outflow (similar to 700 ml/min). Neuro-critical care practice focusing on arterial and ICP regulation has been questioned. Failure of venous efferent flow to precisely match arterial afferent flow will yield immediate and dramatic changes in intracranial blood volume and pressure. Interpreting ICP without interrogating its core drivers may be misleading. Multiple clinical conditions and the cerebral effects of altitude and microgravity relate to imbalances in this dynamic rather than ICP per se. This article reviews the Monro-Kellie doctrine, categorises venous outflow limitation conditions, relates physiological mechanisms to clinical conditions and suggests specific management options.

Awareness and reporting of these subtypes may reduce the under-recognition of potential contributory stenoses in a given patient's idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pulsatile tinnitus.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
   Dural venous sinus stenosis has been associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and isolated venous pulsatile tinnitus. However, the utility of characterizing stenosis as intrinsic or extrinsic remains indeterminate. The aim of this retrospective study was to review preprocedural imaging of patients with symptomatic idiopathic intracranial hypertension and pulsatile tinnitus, classify the stenosis, and assess a trend between stenosis type and clinical presentation while reviewing the frequencies of other frequently seen imaging findings in these conditions.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   MRVs of 115 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and 43 patients with pulsatile tinnitus before venous sinus stent placement were reviewed. Parameters recorded included the following: intrinsic or extrinsic stenosis, prominent emissary veins, optic nerve tortuosity, cephalocele, sella appearance, poststenotic fusiform enlargement versus saccular venous aneurysm, and internal jugular bulb diverticula. ?(2) cross-tabulation statistics were calculated and recorded for all data.
   RESULTS:
   Most patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (75 of 115 sinuses, 65%) had extrinsic stenosis, and most patients with pulsatile tinnitus (37 of 45 sinuses, 82%) had intrinsic stenosis. Marked optic nerve tortuosity was more common in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Cephaloceles were rare in both cohorts, with an increased trend toward the presence in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Empty sellas were more common in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Cerebellar tonsils were similarly located at the foramen magnum level in both cohorts. Saccular venous aneurysms were more common in pulsatile tinnitus. Internal jugular bulb diverticula were similarly common in both cohorts.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   In this cohort, most patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension had extrinsic stenosis, and most patients with pulsatile tinnitus had intrinsic stenosis. Awareness and reporting of these subtypes may reduce the underrecognition of potential contributory stenoses in a given patient?s idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pulsatile tinnitus.

TI Transvers sinus stenting for treatment of resistant tinnitus due to
   pseudotumor cerebri syndrome without papilloedema
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY NEUROSURGERY-ADVANCED TECHNIQUES AND CASE MANAGEMENT
AB Introduction: Pseudotumor cerebri is one of the complex diseases in the field of neurology and neurosurgery. Although it's classical form manifests with headache and blurred vision, and papilledema is seen in the ophthalmological examination, but its clinical manifestations can be without blurred vision and papilledema, and even without headache. Here, we present a diagnostically challenging pseudotumor cerebri case who presented only with refractory tinnitus and had increased intracranial pressure, and the tinnitus was completely resolved with transverse sinus stenting. Conclusion: This case showed that pseudotumor cerebri can have atypical manifestations such as resistant tinnitus without papilledema, and in these cases, intracranial pressure should be measured and its causes, especially cerebral venous sinus stenosis should be investigated and treated.

TI Prediction of intracranial pressure from noninvasive transocular venous
   and arterial hemodynamic measurements - A pilot study
SO NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB Introduction: Continuous measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) requires the invasive placement of epidural, parenchymal, or intraventricular devices. For critical single-point assessments, lumbar puncture may not always be practical. An accurate, reliable, portable and noninvasive method to estimate absolute ICP remains an elusive goal. The arteries that perfuse and the vein that drains the orbit are exposed to the ambient ICP while coursing through the cerebrospinal fluid or optic nerve.
   Methods: The venous outflow pressure (VOP) of the central retinal vein was measured using occlusion in six intensive care patients treated for acute hydrocephalus or brain hemorrhage and in whom transducers of intracranial pressure could provide standardized continuous output. A novel adaptation of the Balliart ophthalmodynamometer was developed for use. Simultaneously, the central retinal (CRA) and ophthalmic (OA) arterial flow velocities were recorded using color Doppler imaging technique. Repeat noninvasive measurements were performed at various ICPs, (n=22 independently collected observations). Linear regression and correlation testing were performed to evaluate these variables for ICP predictability.
   Results: The VOP increased linearly with ICP (r=0.87). The arterial pulsatility indices for both OA and CRA decreased inversely with ICP (r=0.66). An empiric index combining both venous and arterial parameters (VOP/Gosling Pulsatility Index [GPI]) was significantly more correlated with absolute ICP than either parameter alone (r=0.95, p<0.005, ICP=0.29+0.74 [VOP/GPI(OA)]).
   Conclusion: The feasibility to estimate ICP from transocular sonographic and dynamometric data is suggested by these preliminary data. Retinal arterial properties are important in modeling the effect of ICP on the venous outflow pressure. Our pilot results serve as a basis on which to conduct a larger prospective and blinded study.

TI INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION ASSOCIATED WITH UNRUPTURED CEREBRAL
   ARTERIOVENOUS-MALFORMATIONS
SO ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY
AB Only 6 patients with intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations have been reported. We report 6 additional patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic during the past 10 years. The average age was 28 years (range, 10-44 years); 4 were women. Symptoms and signs included papilledema (6 patients), headache (6), transient nonepileptic focal symptoms (4), visual obscurations (3), ipsilateral carotid or ocular bruits (3), abnormal visual fields (3), focal seizures (2), and progressive visual loss (1). Enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the malformations in all 6 patients. The malformations were large, supplied by the branches of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, with the posterior cerebral artery contributing in 3 patients, and all drained into the superior sagittal sinus. Associated venous obstruction was seen in 2 patients. Four patients underwent excision of the arteriovenous malformation, with resolution of papilledema in all 4. Measurements of cortical arterial and venous pressures during surgery in 3 patients showed decreased feeding artery pressures and elevated draining vein pressures, which normalized after removal of the malformation. Treatment in the 2 remaining patients consisted of medical therapy (acetazolamide, furosemide, steroids) alone in 1 patient, and in conjunction with proton beam radiation in the other. Papilledema resolved in the former patient, but the patient receiving proton beam radiation still had papilledema 2 years later. Intracranial hypertension associated with unruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations occurs in young patients with high flow malformations that drain into the superior sagittal sinus, and is likely the result of increased cortical venous and superior sagittal sinus pressure. Excision of the malformation effectively reduces the intracranial pressure.

TI Intracranial and Intraocular Pressure During Various Degrees of
   Head-Down Tilt
SO AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE
AB BACKGROUND: More than half of astronauts develop ophthalmic changes during long-duration spaceflight consistent with an abnormal intraocular and intracranial pressure (IOP, ICP) difference. The aim of our study was to assess IOP and ICP during head-down tilt (HDT) and the additive or attenuating effects of 1% CO2 and lower body negative pressure (LBNP).
   METHODS: In Experiment I, IOP and ICP were measured in nine healthy subjects after 3.5 h HDT in five conditions: -6 degrees, -12 degrees, and -18 degrees HDT, -12 degrees with 1% CO2, and -12 degrees with -20 mmHg LBNP. In Experiment II, IOP was measured in 16 healthy subjects after 5 min tilt at +12 degrees, 0 degrees, -6 degrees, -12 degrees, -18 degrees, and -24 degrees, with and without-40 mmHg LBNP.
   RESULTS: ICP was only found to increase from supine baseline during -18 degrees HDT (9.2 +/- 0.9 and 14.4 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively), whereas IOP increased from 15.7 +/- 0.3 mmHg at 0 degrees to 17.9 +/- 0.4 mmHg during -12 degrees HDT and from 15.3 +/- 0.4 mmHg at 0 degrees to 18.7 +/- 0.4 mmHg during-18 degrees HDT. The addition of -20 mmHg LBNP or 1% CO2 had no further effects on ICP or IOP. However, the use of -40 mmHg LBNP during HDT lowered IOP back to baseline values, except at 24 degrees HDT.
   DISCUSSION: A small, posterior intraocular-intracranial pressure difference (IOP > ICP) is maintained during HDT, and a sustained or further decreased difference may lead to structural changes in the eye in real and simulated microgravity.

TI Fulminant intracranial hypertension as a result of otological surgery:
   case report and discussion of management
SO JOURNAL OF LARYNGOLOGY AND OTOLOGY
AB Background Dural venous sinus injury is a rare complication of otological surgery that can lead to life-threatening sequelae, the management of which is complex and poorly described.
   Case report This paper describes the case of a 40-year-old female who underwent routine right myringoplasty complicated by sigmoid sinus laceration. The patient subsequently developed right-sided lateral sinus thrombosis leading to fulminant intracranial hypertension. The patient underwent successful emergency management by surgical reconstruction of the sigmoid sinus, followed by endovascular thrombolysis, catheter balloon angioplasty and endovascular stenting.
   Conclusion Torrential haemorrhage following otological procedures is uncommon and rarely requires packing of a bleeding venous sinus. This case highlights that injury to a highly dominant venous sinus can lead to venous outflow obstruction and life-threatening intracranial hypertension. To our knowledge, the development of this complication following otological surgery and its management has not been reported previously.

TI Styloidectomy and Venous Stenting for Treatment of Styloid-Induced
   Internal Jugular Vein Stenosis: A Case Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Internal jugular vein stenosis (IJVS) results in poor venous outflow and can result in intracranial hypertension. Venous stenting has become a debated topic for correction of this pathology.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old male merchant with bilateral IJVS presented with headache, dizziness, and pulsatile tinnitus. He was found to have intracranial hypertension and left IJVS caused by styloid process compression and right IJVS caused by damage of the venous intima. His symptoms improved after undergoing styloidectomy followed by left intra-internal jugular vein (IJV) balloon. However, 1 year later, the prior symptoms reoccurred. At this time, the patient underwent right intra-IJV stenting. After treatment of the contralateral side, the symptoms resolved during the following 3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical practice in this case indicated that in patients with bilateral IJVS, a 2-side intervention may be necessary when unilateral correction fails. We advise a staged approach to correction of bilateral IJVS. Styloid compression-induced IJVS should be corrected by styloidectomy in combination with balloon and/or stenting, whereas IJVS induced by venous wall issues needs only stenting.

TI Noninvasive indicators of intracranial pressure before, during, and
   after long-duration spaceflight
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Weightlessness induces a cephalad shift of blood and cerebrospinal fluid that may increase intracranial pressure (ICP) during spaceflight, whereas lower body negative pressure (LBNP) may provide an opportunity to caudally redistribute fluids and lower ICP. To investigate the effects of spaceflight and LBNP on noninvasive indicators of ICP (nICP), we studied 13 crewmembers before and after spaceflight in seated, supine, and 15 degrees head-down tilt postures, and at similar to 45 and similar to 150 days of spaceflight with and without 25 mmHg LBNP. We used four techniques to quantify nICP: cerebral and cochlear fluid pressure (CCFP), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), ultrasound measures of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), and ultrasound-based internal jugular vein pressure (IJVp). On flight day 45, two nICP measures were lower than preflight supine posture [CCFP: mean difference -98.5 -nL (CI: -190.8 to -6.1 -nL), P = 0.037]; [OAE: -19.7 degrees (CI: -10.4 degrees to -29.1 degrees), P < 0.001], but not significantly different from preflight seated measures. Conversely, ONSD was not different than any preflight posture, whereas IJVp was significantly greater than preflight seated measures [14.3 mmHg (CI: 10.1 to 18.5 mmHg), P < 0.001], but not significantly different than preflight supine measures. During spaceflight, acute LBNP application did not cause a significant change in nICP indicators. These data suggest that during spaceflight, nICP is not elevated above values observed in the seated posture on Earth. Invasive measures would be needed to provide absolute ICP values and more precise indications of ICP change during various phases of spaceflight.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The current study provides new evidence that intracranial pressure (ICP), as assessed with noninvasive measures, may not be elevated during long-duration spaceflight. In addition, the acute use of lower body negative pressure did not significantly reduce indicators of ICP during weightlessness.

TI Endovascular stenting for intracranial venous hypertension caused by
   meningioma: A case series and systematic literature review
SO JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Background & purpose: Venous intracranial hypertension is defined as an increased intracranial pressure secondary to venous congestion. Specific causes of venous hypertension can be identified, including extrinsic venous sinus compression or invasion by intracranial tumors such as meningioma. We aimed to report a case series of four patients with symptomatic venous intracranial hypertension secondary to meningioma and treated with stenting. We also performed a systematic literature review. Methods: The local case series included consecutive patients with symptomatic venous intracranial hypertension who underwent venous sinus stenting in our center between January 2010 and June 2024. Initial clinical presentation, imaging data, treatment details and long-term outcomes were presented. A systematic literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines up to June 2024. Results: Four patients were treated in our center during the study period. In all cases, stenting was adequately performed without complication. Patients experienced substantial and durable clinical improvement, including papilledema resorption. Eight publications were included in the literature review (28 patients). Including our 4 reported cases, a total of 32 patients were analyzed in the systematic review. Complete symptoms recovery occurred in 25 patients (78.1 %) and a partial resolution in 7 (21.9 %). Twelve patients received adjuvant radiotherapy, two of whom also underwent surgery. Five patients presented clinical recurrence and required endovascular retreatment. No complications were reported. Conclusion: In the setting of a compression or invasion due to a meningioma, stenting of symptomatic intracranial venous stenoses appeared as a safe and promisingly effective option.

TI Posture-related changes in the pressure environment of the
   ventriculoperitoneal shunt system
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Object. The purpose of this study is to clarify the whole pressure environment of the ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt system in patients with successfully treated hydrocephalus and to determine which factor of the pressure environment has a preventive effect on overdrainage.
   Methods. Thirteen patients with hydrocephalus who had been treated with VP shunt therapy by using a Codman-Hakim programmable valve without incidence of overdrainage were examined. The authors evaluated intracranial pressure (ICP), intraabdominal pressure (IAP), hydrostatic pressure (HP), and the perfusion pressure (PP) of the shunt system with the patients both supine and sitting.
   With patients supine, ICP, LAP, and KP were 4.6 +/- 3 mm Hg, 5.7 +/- 3.3 mm Hg, and 3.3 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. As a result, the PP was only 2.2 +/- 4.9 mm Hg. When the patients sat up, the IAP increased to 14.7 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, and ICP decreased to -14.2 +/- 4.5 mm Hg. The increased IAP and decreased ICP offset 67% of the HP (42.9 +/- 3.5 mm Hg), and consequently the PP (14 +/- 6.3 mm Hg) corresponded to only 33% of HP.
   Conclusions. The results observed in patients indicated that IAP as well as ICP play an important role in VP shunt therapy and that the increased IAP and the decreased ICP in patients placed in the upright position allow them to adapt to the siphoning effect and for overdrainage thereby to be avoided.

TI Incidence of venous system disease in pseudotumor cerebri
SO NEUROLOGIA
AB Objective. Pseudotumor cerebri (PC) is a complex syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure in the absence of any space occupying lesion, usually self-limiting, but often relapsing. In recent years, some authors had researched the relationship between venous sinus disease and PC and they have suggested that it must be ruled out by magnetic resonance venography (MRV) before diagnosing this condition as idiopathic. Our aim is to determine the frequency of venous sinus disease and the need for MRV in these patients.
   Methods. We have studied 14 patients admitted between 1998 and 2005 in the Neurology Department of the University Clinical Hospital "Lozano Blesa" (Zaragoza; Spain) who had been diagnosed of PC. We reviewed the epidemiological and clinical features. The MRVs were reviewed and their appearances rated for focal narrowing and signal gaps.
   Results. Six patients had strong signal in both lateral and transverse sinus and their image was considered as normal. The other eight patients showed filling defects on the transverse sinus (focal unilateral narrowing in four cases, one or more signal gaps in four cases).
   Conclusions. The presence of signal gaps in the venous sinus (stenosis/hypoplasia or absence of signal) is a frequent finding in patients with PC. That is why we have concluded that this test is important in patients with PC in order to search for a possible etiology and treatment option.

TI Bogota-VAC - A Newly Modified Temporary Abdominal Closure Technique
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB Background: We present Bogota-VAC, a newly modified temporary abdominal closure (TAC) technique for open abdomen condition after abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).
   Methods: A thin isolation bag (Bogota bag) and a vacuum assisted closure (VAC) system were combined. A matching bag was tension-free fixed on the abdominal fascia by fascia suture. A ring shaped black polyurethane foam of the VAC system was placed into the gap between Bogota bag, abdominal fascia and the wound edge. A constant negative topic pressure of 50-75 mmHg was used in the VAC system.
   Results: Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP: 22 +/- 2 mmHg) of four patients with ACS after severe traumatic brain injury and one patient with isolated ACS after blunt abdominal trauma decreased significantly (p = 0.01) after decompressive laparotomy and treatment with Bogota-VAC (IAP: 10 +/- 2 mmHg) and remained low, measured via urinary bladder pressure. Intracranial pressure (ICP) in the four traumatic brain injury patients decreased from 42 +/- 13 mmHg to 15 +/- 3 mmHg after abdominal decompression. Cerebral perfusion pressure (57 14 mmHg) increased to 74 +/- 2 mmHg.
   Conclusion: The advantage of the presented Bogota-VAC is leak tightness, wound conditioning (soft tissue/fascia), skin protection and facilitation of nursing in combination with highest volume reserve capacity (VRC), thus preventing recurrent increased intra-abdominal and intracranial pressure in the initial phase after decompression of ACS compared to other TAC techniques.

TI Partial Aortic Occlusion and Cerebral Venous Steal Venous Effects of
   Arterial Manipulation in Acute Stroke
SO STROKE
AB Acute ischemic stroke therapy emphasizes early arterial clot lysis or removal. Partial aortic occlusion has recently emerged as an alternative hemodynamic approach to augment cerebral perfusion in acute ischemic stroke. The exact mechanism of cerebral flow augmentation with partial aortic occlusion remains unclear and may involve more than simple diversion of arterial blood flow from the lower body to cerebral collateral circulation. The cerebral venous steal hypothesis suggests that even a small increase in tissue pressure in the ischemic area will divert blood flow to surrounding regions with lesser tissue pressures. This may cause no-reflow (absence of flow after restoration of arterial patency) in the ischemic core and "luxury perfusion" in the surrounding regions. Such maldistribution may be reversed with increased venous pressure titrated to avoid changes in intracranial pressure. We propose that partial aortic occlusion enhances perfusion in the brain by offsetting cerebral venous steal. Partial aortic occlusion redistributes blood volume into the upper part of the body, manifested by an increase in central venous pressure. Increased venous pressure recruits the collapsed vascular network and, by eliminating cerebral venous steal, corrects perifocal perfusion maldistribution analogous to positive end-expiratory pressure recruitment of collapsed airways to decrease ventilation/perfusion mismatch in the lungs.

TI Coupling of CSF and sagittal sinus pressure in adult patients with
   pseudotumour cerebri
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Objective Pseudotumour cerebri syndrome (PTCS including idiopathic intracranial hypertension) is characterised by the symptoms and signs of raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFp) in the absence of ventricular dilatation or an intracranial mass lesion. Its aetiology is unknown in the majority of cases but there is much evidence for impaired CSF absorption. Traditionally, sagittal sinus pressure has been considered to be independent of CSF pressure in adults. However, the discovery of stenoses of intracranial venous sinuses and introduction of venous sinus stenting has highlighted the importance of the venous drainage in PTCS. In this study, we have explored the relationship between CSFp and SSp before and during a CSF infusion test and during CSF drainage. Materials and methods Ten patients (9 females:1 male) with PTCS underwent infusion studies in parallel with direct retrograde cerebral venography. Both SSp and CSFp were recorded at a baseline and during CSFp elevation in a course of a CSF infusion test. The drainage of CSF after the CSF infusion was performed in 7 patients. In 5 cases, jugular venous pressure was also measured. Results CSFp and SSp including their amplitudes correlated significantly and strongly both at baseline (R = 0.96; p = 0.001) and during infusion (R = 0.92; p = 0.0026). During drainage, this correlation was maintained until SSp reached a stable value, whereas CSFp continued to decrease. Conclusions In this series of ten patients with PTCS, CSFp and SSp were coupled, both at baseline and during infusion. The implications of such coupling for the calculation of CSF outflow resistance are discussed.

TI The incidence of significant venous sinus stenosis and cerebral
   hyperemia in childhood hydrocephalus: prognostic value with regards to
   differentiating active from compensated disease
SO FLUIDS AND BARRIERS OF THE CNS
AB Background Symptomatic or active hydrocephalus in children is linked to an elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP), which is likely to be multifactorial in origin. The CSF outflow resistance, venous sinus resistance and total cerebral blood flow are likely factors in the ICP elevation. The purpose of this paper is to define the incidence, site and significance of venous sinus stenosis and/or cerebral hyperemia in a cohort of children diagnosed with hydrocephalus at a tertiary referral hospital. Methods The imaging database was reviewed over a 10 year period and the index MRI of all children between the ages of 4 months and 15 years, who were diagnosed with treatment naive hydrocephalus of any type (excluding secondary to tumor) and had magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and flow quantification were selected. Patients were compared with children undergoing an MRI with MRV and flow quantification who were subsequently shown to have no abnormality. The cross-sectional area and circumference of the sinuses were measured at 4 levels. The hydraulic and effective diameters were calculated. An area stenosis of 65% or greater was deemed significant. A total cerebral blood flow greater than two standard deviations above the mean for controls was taken to be abnormal. Results There were a total of 55 children with hydrocephalus compared to 118 age matched control MRV's and 35 control flow quantification studies. A high grade stenosis occurred in 56% of patients but in none of the controls (p < 0.0001). The commonest site of narrowing was in the distal sigmoid sinus. Cerebral hyperemia occurred in 13% of patients but did not occur in the controls. Conclusions The elevation in ICP in symptomatic hydrocephalus is multifactorial. Both high grade venous stenosis and cerebral hyperemia are common in childhood hydrocephalus. High grade stenosis was noted to be a risk factor for conservative management failure. Hyperemia was a good prognostic indicator.

TI Delayed presentation of iatrogenic ventriculoperitoneal shunt
   transection following laparoscopic weight loss surgery in a patient with
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is strongly associated with central obesity and consequential raised intra-abdominal pressure. If left untreated it poses significant risk to vision and can eventually cause blindness. Owing to its pathophysiology, this condition is managed by both medical and surgical specialities. When medical management fails neurosurgeons commonly treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension by permanent cerebrospinal fluid peritoneal shunting. Weight reduction surgery provides patients who are obese with a multitude of benefits and it is not uncommon for the general surgeon to be presented with a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and a cerebrospinal fluid peritoneal shunt in place. This provides a potential challenging situation in weight-loss surgical procedures. We describe an interesting case where laparoscopic bariatric surgery resulted in transection of the abdominal catheter with a delayed presentation of recurrent symptoms and an abdominal cerebrospinal fluid collection in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. We discuss how this could be avoided and its management.

TI The cerebral venous system and the postural regulation of intracranial
   pressure: implications in the management of patients with cerebrospinal
   fluid diversion
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs commonly in daily neurosurgical practice. Understanding the altered physiology following CSF loss is important for optimization of patient care and avoidance of complications. There is overwhelming evidence now that the cerebral venous system plays a major role in intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics especially when one takes into account the effects of postural changes, atmospheric pressure, and gravity on the craniospinal axis as a whole. The CSF and cerebral venous compartments are tightly coupled in two important ways. CSF is resorbed into the venous system, and there is also an evolved mechanism that prevents overdrainage of venous blood with upright positioning known as the Starling resistor. With loss of CSF pressure, this protective mechanism could become nonfunctional which may result in posture-related venous overdrainage through the cranial venous outflow tracts leading to pathologic states. This review article summarizes the relevant anatomic and physiologic basis of the relationship between the craniospinal venous and CSF compartments in the setting of CSF diversion. It is hoped that this article improves our understanding of ICP dynamics after CSF loss, adds a new dimension to our therapeutic methods, stimulates further research into this field, and ultimately improves our care of these patients.

TI Oscillations of Hemodynamic Parameters Induced by Negative Pressure
   Breathing in Healthy Humans
SO AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE
AB INTRODUCTION: Negative pressure breathing is breathing with decreased pressure in the respiratory tract without lowering pressure acting on the torso. We lowered air pressure only during inspiration (NPBin). NPBin, used to increase venous return to the heart, is considered a countermeasure against redistribution of body fluids toward the head during spaceflight. We studied NPBin effects on circulation in healthy humans with an emphasis on NPBin-induced oscillations of hemodynamic parameters synchronous with breathing. We propose an approach to analyze the oscillations based on coherent averaging. METHODS: Eight men ages 24-42 yr participated in the NPBin and control series. During the series, to reproduce fluids shift observed under microgravity, subjects were supine and head down (-8 degrees). Duration of NPBin was 20 min, rarefaction -20 cm H 2 O. Hemodynamic parameters were measured by Finometer. Electrical impedance measurements were used to estimate changes in blood filling of cerebral vessels. RESULTS: Mean values of hemodynamic parameters virtually did not change under NPBin, but NPBin induced oscillations of the parameters synchronous with respiration. Peak -to -peak amplitude under NPBin were: mean arterial pressure, 4 +/- 1 (mmHg); stroke volume, 7 +/- 3 (mL); and heart rate, 4 +/- 1 (bpm). Electrical impedance of the head increased during inspiration. The increase under NPBin was three times greater than under normal breathing. DISCUSSION: Analysis of oscillations gives more information than analysis of mean values. NPBin induces short-term decrease in left ventricle stroke volume and arterial blood pressure during each inspiration; the decrease is compensated by increase after inspiration. NPBin facilitates redistribution of body fluids away from the head. IP: 203.8.109.10 On: Mon, 27 May 2024 10:52:20 Copyright: Aerospace Medical Association

TI A Case of Bilateral Papilledema With Improved Clinical Symptoms by
   Venous Stenting for Superior Sagittal Sinus Stenosis
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Superior sagittal sinus (SSS) obstruction causes intracranial hypertension, often requiring surgical stenting. Consensus on treating brain venous sinus stenosis, another cause, is lacking. This study reports a case of SSS stenosis and intracranial hypertension treated with venous stenting, improving bilateral papilledema. A 51-year-old with a headache and visual disturbance had papilledema and visual field loss. MR venography showed SSS stenosis, leading to a neurosurgery referral. Lumbar puncture confirmed intracranial hypertension (>35 cmH2O), prompting venous stenting. Post-procedure, papilledema, headache, and visual field loss improved. Venous stenting could be effective for SSS stenosis with clinically proven or recurrent pressure differences. Further cases are needed for standardization.

TI Increasing abdominal pressure with and without PEEP: effects on
   intra-peritoneal, intra-organ and intra-vascular pressures
SO BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Background: Intra-organ and intra-vascular pressures can be used to estimate intra-abdominal pressure. The aim of this prospective, interventional study was to assess the effect of PEEP on the accuracy of pressure estimation at different measurement sites in a model of increased abdominal pressure.
   Methods: Catheters for pressure measurement were inserted into the stomach, urinary bladder, peritoneal cavity, pulmonary artery and inferior vena cava of 12 pigs. The pressures were recorded simultaneously at baseline, during 10 cm H2O PEEP, external abdominal pressure (7 kg weight) plus PEEP, external abdominal pressure without PEEP, and again under baseline conditions.
   Results (mean +/- SD): PEEP alone increased diastolic pulmonary artery and inferior vena cava pressure but had no effect on the other pressures. PEEP and external abdominal pressure increased intraperitoneal pressure from 6 +/- 1 mm Hg to 9 +/- 2 mm Hg, urinary bladder pressure from 6 +/- 2 mm Hg to 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (p = 0.012), intragastric pressure from 6 +/- 2 mm Hg to 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (all p <= 0.001), and inferior vena cava pressure from 11 +/- 4 mm Hg to 15 +/- 4 mm Hg (p = 0.01). Removing PEEP and maintaining extraabdominal pressure was associated with a decrease in pulmonary artery diastolic but not in any of the other pressures. There was a significant correlation among all pressures. Bias (-1 mm Hg) and limits of agreement (3 to -5 mm Hg) were similar for the comparisons of absolute intraperitoneal pressure with intra-gastric and urinary bladder pressure, but larger for the comparison between intraperitoneal and inferior vena cava pressure (-5, 0 to -11 mm Hg). Bias (0 to -1 mm Hg) and limits of agreement (3 to -4 mm Hg) for pressure changes were similar for all comparisons
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that pressure changes induced by external abdominal pressure were not modified by changing PEEP between 0 and 10 cm H2O.

AB Progressive visual loss is the most common neurologic finding in osteopetrosis. Several mechanisms mall explain this phenomenon, including compression of the optic nerves caused by bony overgrowth of the optic canals and retinal degeneration. We report a child with osteopetrosis and progressive visual loss, even though patent optic canals were demonstrated by computed tomography and digital holography. This patient's visual loss was caused by increased intracranial pressure secondary to obstruction of cerebral venous outflow at the jugular foramen. This case points to the importance of a full evaluation of the skull base foramina in the diagnostic workup of visual loss in patients with osteopetrosis. (Surv Ophthalmol 43:487-490, 1999.

TI Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder of raised intracranial pressure of unknown etiology. For overweight or obese patients with IIH, weight reduction of 5% to 10% of total body weight at diagnosis is a long-term treatment strategy. Though not proven, the initiation of acetazolamide can assist in symptom reduction and resolution. In patients with either fulminant IIH or those on maximal medical management with progressive vision loss, intravenous steroids and acetazolamide can be initiated while surgical options are urgently arranged. Because of its lower complication rate, I prefer to use optic nerve sheath fenestration in settings of precipitous visual decline, but I have used cerebrospinal fluid diversion surgery in settings of vision loss with severe, intractable headache. Often, the choice of surgical intervention is individualized for the patient and the available expertise. In the future, results from the ongoing multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) will provide important data regarding the efficacy of acetazolamide and the utility of diet and exercise.

TI Concurrent Venous Stenting of the Transverse and Occipito-Marginal
   Sinuses: An Analogy with Parallel Hemodynamic Circuits
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCES IN RURAL PRACTICE
AB Nonthrombotic intracranial venous occlusive disease (NIVOD) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and various non-IIH headache syndromes. Endovascular stenting of stenotic, dominant transverse sinuses (TSs) may reduce trans-stenosis pressure gradients, decrease intracranial pressure, and alleviate symptoms in a subset of NIVOD patients. We present a case in which concurrent stenting of the occipito-marginal sinus obliterated the residual trans-stenosis pressure gradient across an initially stented dominant TS. We hypothesize that this observation may be explained using an electric-hydraulic analogy, and that this patient's dominant TS and occipito-marginal sinus may be modeled as a parallel hemodynamic circuit. Neurointerventionalists should be aware of parallel hemodynamic drainage patterns and consider manometry and possibly additional stenting of stenotic, parallel venous outflow pathways if TS stenting alone fails to obliterate the trans-stenosis pressure gradient.

SO BRAZILIAN NEUROSURGERY-ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE NEUROCIRURGIA
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease characterized by an increase in intracranial pressure, without presence of parenchymal lesions or hydrocephalus that justify it. Over 90% of cases there is association with stenosis of the dural venous sinuses. It is characterized by headache, tinidus, nausea, vomiting and visual disturbances. Initial treatment is clinical and when it fails there is indication of invasive procedures, among them shunts and fenestration of the optic nerve sheath. Angioplasty of dural venous sinuses, when indicated, has shown an alternative with better results and less complications. We report a case of a female patient, with 27 years old, diagnosed with IIH and bilateral transverse sinus stenosis, which was treated by bilateral stenting and total resolution of symptoms. Besides describing the case we review the literature about the subject.

TI INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION AND CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID PRODUCTION IN DOGS -
   EFFECTS OF FUROSEMIDE
SO EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY
AB A method using chronically prepared, anesthetized dogs was devised for studying the effects of treatments of intracranial hypertension induced by applying a reversible extradural mass lesion while simultaneously measuring production of cerebrospinal fluid. This was measured with a ventricular-cisternal perfusion technique in which the rate of cisternal outflow could be controlled by a pump and matched to the inflow, allowing intracranial pressure to fluctuate despite simultaneous measurement of  cerebrospinal fluid formation. Elevations of intracranial pressure to the range 20 to 35 Torr were induced and maintained during perfusion, but elevations above 35 Torr would not permit continued perfusion. At normal intracranial pressure, 10 Torr or less, rates of cerebrospinal fluid formation were the same whether the outflow controlling pump or free outflow was used. Formation of cerebrospinal fluid decreased progressively as intracranial pressure increased above 20 Torr. It also decreased  with time after the start of perfusion during the course of 5 h, but returned to the initial range during the control phase of subsequent experiments in the same animal. Furosemide, 3 mg kg-1, i.v., had no significant effect on rate of formation but did induce a small decrease in ICP in time-controlled experiments in which i.v. fluid replacement limited net fluid losses to 20 ml kg-1 with no change in mean arterial or central venous pressures.

TI Occipital Sinus Pericranii Superseding Both Jugular Veins: Description
   of Two Rare Pediatric Cases
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: The extracranial venous drainage of the brain is provided mainly by the jugular veins with the variable participation of extrajugular pathways. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two cases of occipital sinus pericranii (SP) were observed. A 6-year-old girl presented with a progressively enlarging occipital lump; she was otherwise asymptomatic. An 8-year-old boy presented with mild nuchal headache. In the former case, neuroimaging examinations confirmed the diagnosis of SP; in the latter, SP was noticed on magnetic resonance imaging because it was neglected at physical examination. In both subjects, the radiological examination also showed bilateral occlusion of the jugular veins with ventricular dilation and herniation of cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum. CONCLUSION: Exceptionally, SP was noticed to represent the main venous drainage of the underlying brain, thereby compensating for the intracranial hypertension due to venous engorgement. Preservation of SP was advised, and any surgical or endovascular treatment was contraindicated.

TI Intraocular pressure and choroidal thickness respond differently to
   lower body negative pressure during spaceflight
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) develops during long-duration (>1 mo) spaceflight presumably because of chronic exposure to a headward fluid shift that occurs in weightlessness. We aimed to determine whether reversing this headward fluid shift with acute application of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) can influence outcome measures at the eye. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and subfoveal choroidal thickness were therefore evaluated by tonometry and optical coherence tomography (OCT), respectively, in 14 International Space Station crewmembers before flight in the seated, supine, and 15 degrees headdown tilt (HDT) postures and during spaceflight, without and with application of 25 mmHg LBNP. IOP in the preflight seated posture was 14.4 mmHg (95% CI, 13.5-15.2 mmHg), and spaceflight elevated this value by 1.3 mmHg (95% CI, 0.7-1.8 mmHg, P < 0.001). Acute exposure to LBNP during spaceflight reduced IOP to 14.2 mmHg (95% CI, 13.4-15.0 mmHg), which was equivalent to that of the seated posture (P > 0.99), indicating that venous fluid redistribution by LBNP can influence ocular outcome variables during spaceflight. Choroidal thickness during spaceflight (374 mu m, 95% CI, 325-423 mu m) increased by 35 mu m (95% CI, 25-45 mu m, P < 0.001), compared with the preflight seated posture (339 mu m, 95% CI, 289-388 mu m). Acute use of LBNP during spaceflight did not affect choroidal thickness (381 mu m, 95% CI, 331-430 mu m, P = 0.99). The finding that transmission of reduced venous pressure by LBNP did not decrease choroidal thickness suggests that engorgement of this tissue during spaceflight may reflect changes that are secondary to the chronic cerebral venous congestion associated with spaceflight.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Spaceflight induces a chronic headward fluid shift that is believed to underlie ocular changes observed in astronauts. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that reversing this headward fluid shift via application of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) during spaceflight may alter the ocular venous system, as evidenced by a decrease in intraocular pressure. This finding indicates that LBNP has the potential to be an effective countermeasure against the headward fluid shift during spaceflight, which may then be beneficial in preventing or reversing associated ocular changes.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: 120-day clinical, radiological,
   and manometric outcomes after stent insertion into the dural venous
   sinus
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is commonly associated with venous sinus stenosis. In recent years, transvenous dural venous sinus stent (DVSS) insertion has emerged as a potential therapy for resistant cases. However, there remains considerable uncertainty over the safety and efficacy of this procedure, in particular the incidence of intraprocedural and delayed complications and in the longevity of sinus patency, pressure gradient obliteration, and therapeutic clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to determine clinical, radiological, and manometric outcomes at 3-4 months after DVSS in this treated IIH cohort.
   METHODS Clinical, radiographic, and manometric data before and 3-4 months after DVSS were reviewed in this single-center case series. All venographic and manometric procedures were performed under local anesthesia with the patient supine.
   RESULTS Forty-one patients underwent DVSS venography/manometry within 120 days. Sinus pressure reduction of between 11 and 15 mm Hg was achieved 3-4 months after DVSS compared with pre-stent baseline, regardless of whether the procedure was primary or secondary (after shunt surgery). Radiographic obliteration of anatomical stenosis correlating with reduction in pressure gradients was observed. The complication rate after DVSS was 4.9% and stent survival was 87.8% at 120 days. At least 20% of patients developed restenosis following DVSS and only 63.3% demonstrated an improvement or resolution of papilledema.
   CONCLUSIONS Reduced venous sinus pressures were observed at 120 days after the procedure. DVSS showed lower complication rates than shunts, but the clinical outcome data were less convincing. To definitively compare the outcomes between DVSS and shunts in IIH, a randomized prospective study is needed.

TI Radiological signs supporting idiopathic intracranial hypertension in
   symptomatic patients with lumbar puncture opening pressure < 250 mm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Lumbar puncture opening pressure (LPOP) exceeding 250mmH(2)O is key in diagnosing idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), per revised Friedman's criteria. Some patients do not meet LPOP criteria (with or without papilledema), despite having IIH-related symptoms and neuroimaging findings. This study aimed to investigate the radiological findings and clinical symptoms in patients suspected of having IIH without meeting the LPOP criteria. We retrospectively evaluated cerebral venous sinus stenosis using the conduit Farb score (CFS) and other radiological findings suggestive of IIH by computed tomography venography and magnetic resonance venography in females >= 18 years-old with chronic headaches, suspected IIH, and LPOP < 250 mm. Eighty-eight women (56 with LPOP < 200 mm H2O and 32 with LPOP ranging between 200 and 250mmH(2)O) were included. Among patients with LPOP 200-250mmH(2)O, 40% (12) exhibited three or more radiological findings supporting IIH, compared to 17% (8) in the LPOP < 200 mmH(2)O group (p = 0.048). Cerebral venous stenosis (CFS <= 5) was observed in 80% (24) of those with LPOP 200-250 mmH(2)O, contrasting with 40% (19) of those with LPOP < 200 mmH(2)O (p < 0.001). Cerebral venous stenosis was significantly more common in patients with LPOP 200-250 mmH(2)O than < 200 mmH(2)O, suggesting that they may benefit from IIH treatment.

TI Endovascular treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Analysis
   of eight consecutive patients
SO NEUROCHIRURGIE
AB Introduction. - Optic nerve sheath fenestration or ventricular shunting are classically proposed after failure of medical treatment. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is caused by venous sinus obstruction in an unknown percentage of cases. Recently, endoluminal venous sinus stenting was proposed as an alternative treatment.
   Patients and method. - Between September 2003 and December 2004, eight consecutive patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension underwent MRI venography and direct retrograde cerebral angiography.
   Results. - There were five females and three males aged 22 to 55 years. All patients had vision disorders. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure ranged from 27 to 45 mmHg with normal composition. All patients presented at least one sinus stenosis. Endovascular stenting of the stenotic venous sinus was performed under intravenous heparin administration. Anti-platelet therapy was administered for 3 months post treatment. Intra-sinus pressures were invariably reduced by stenting. Mean follow-up was 18 months. All patients improved clinically. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure had normalized at 3-month follow-up in all patients. In all patients, multidetector row CT-angiography or MRI venography was performed at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up and demonstrated the patency of the stent.
   Discussion. - The importance of venous sinus disease as a cause of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is probably underestimated. Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension should be evaluated with direct retrograde cerebral venography and manometry. In patients with venous sinus lesions, treatment by an endoluminal venous sinus stent is a safe and effective alternative for amenable lesions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

TI The effect of increased intra-abdominal pressure on orbital subarachnoid
   space width and intraocular pressure
SO NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH
AB In accordance with the trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference theory, decreasing the trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference can relieve glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Increased intracranial pressure can also reduce optic nerve damage in glaucoma patients, and a safe, effective and noninvasive way to achieve this is by increasing the intra-abdominal pressure. The purpose of this study was to observe the changes in orbital subarachnoid space width and intraocular pressure at elevated intra-abdominal pressure. An inflatable abdominal belt was tied to each of 15 healthy volunteers, aged 22-30 years (12 females and 3 males), at the navel level, without applying pressure to the abdomen, before they laid in the magnetic resonance imaging machine. The baseline orbital subarachnoid space width around the optic nerve was measured by magnetic resonance imaging at 1, 3, 9, and 15 mm behind the globe. The abdominal belt was inflated to increase the pressure to 40 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), then the orbital subarachnoid space width was measured every 10 minutes for 2 hours. After removal of the pressure, the measurement was repeated 10 and 20 minutes later. In a separate trial, the intraocular pressure was measured for all the subjects at the same time points, before, during and after elevated intra-abdominal pressure. Results showed that the baseline mean orbital subarachnoid space width was 0.88 +/- 0.1 mm (range: 0.77-1.05 mm), 0.77 +/- 0.11 mm (range: 0.60-0.94 mm), 0.70 +/- 0.08 mm (range: 0.62-0.80 mm), and 0.68 +/- 0.08 mm (range: 0.57-0.77 mm) at 1, 3, 9, and 15 mm behind the globe, respectively. During the elevated intra-abdominal pressure, the orbital subarachnoid space width increased from the baseline and dilation of the optic nerve sheath was significant at 1, 3 and 9 mm behind the globe. After decompression of the abdominal pressure, the orbital subarachnoid space width normalized and returned to the baseline value. There was no significant difference in the intraocular pressure before, during and after the intra-abdominal pressure elevation. These results verified that the increased intra-abdominal pressure widens the orbital subarachnoid space in this acute trial, but does not alter the intraocular pressure, indicating that intraocular pressure is not affected by rapid increased intra-abdominal pressure.

   Stenosis After Venous Sinus Stenting
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Venous stenting has become a promising treatment for various sinus stenosis. However, it is not without its own set of risks.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We reported de novo formation of dural arteriovenous fistula poststenting for venous sinus stenosis in a patient with pseudotumor cerebri. Multiple factors, including subclinical thrombus formation, sinus wall injury by stent placement, and up-regulated inflammatory factors, may contribute to its pathogenesis.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case indicates that physicians may need to be aware of this rare complication, which can be managed without resumption of pseudotumor cerebri symptoms.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: From physiopathological mechanisms
   to therapeutic decision
SO REVUE DE MEDECINE INTERNE
AB Clinical features include visual disturbances, headaches, and pulsatile tinnitus that can be associated with reduced quality of life, and a risk of irreversible visual impairment in some cases. Obese women of childbearing age represent the main at-risk population, and the incidence of the disease is increasing because of rising prevalence of obesity worldwide. In addition, an imbalance in sex hormones is reported as a contributing risk factor. The pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension involves a dis-turbance of the evacuation pathway of intracranial fluids caused by the increase in intracranial venous pressure. Brain imaging is useful for diagnosis with several signs including bilateral stenosis of the trans-verse sinuses that plays a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease by creating a positive feedback loop that increases intracranial venous hypertension and contributes to clinical manifestations. Treat-ment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent permanent visual impairment. Drug therapies including acetazolamide and topiramate have moderate effectiveness. Among invasive treatments, transverse sinus stenting seems to be the most interesting option to consider in drug-resistant patients. Weight loss remains essential to achieve a sustainable improvement by reducing central venous pressure. Future randomized trials are expected to reach a consensus on this treatment.(c) 2022 Societe Nationale Franc , aise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

SO LIFE-BASEL
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a debilitating condition that has traditionally been difficult to treat. In recent years, there has been increasing focus on the role of intracranial venous hypertension in the pathophysiology of IIH. Based on increased understanding of this pathophysiology, venous sinus stenting (VSS) has emerged as a safe and reliable treatment for a certain population of patients with IIH. Stratifying patients with IIH based on the status of their venous outflow can provide insight into which patients may enjoy reduction in their symptoms after VSS and provides information regarding why some patients may have symptom recurrence. The traditional view of IIH as a disease due to obesity in young women has been cast into doubt as the understanding of the role of intracranial venous hypertension has improved.

TI Pseudotumor-like syndrome and cerebrospinal fluid leak in meningiomas
   involving the posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus: report of
   4 cases
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Meningiomas that partially or completely occlude the superior sagittal sinus may create a pseudotumor-like syndrome in certain patients. These patients may have impaired CSF absorption as a result of higher proximal venous pressure. Higher pressures after resection may encumber adequate wound healing and worsen symptoms. Here, the authors present a small series of patients with meningiomas involving the posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus, with documented high intracranial pressure prior to surgery. This paper aims to address the proposed etiology of high intracranial pressure in these patients and its associated complications, including CSF leak, wound dehiscence, pressure-related headaches, and visual complaints. In this paper, the authors propose a management plan to avoid wound complications and pseudotumor-related complications. When considering surgical intervention for patients with compromise of the posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus, careful attention must be paid to addressing potentially elevated intracranial pressure perioperatively.

The deadly trauma triad and damage control surgery are concepts intimately related with the abdominal compartment syndrome, its physiology and treatment are described briefly. The review also explores the relationship between intra abdominal pressure and intra cranial pressure, and describes a new treatment strategy for intractable intracranial hypertension after traumatic brain injury based on this relationship. The complexity of polytraumatized patients forces us to study from a universal point of view the physiologic phenomena involved, and to identify and treat the repercussions that these may have in the rest of the body. Trauma sets the perfect stage for a better understanding of the body's physiology and reminds us of the great complexity that is the human body machinery.

TI Arterial hypertension increases intracranial pressure in cat after
   opening of the blood-brain barrier
SO JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
AB Background: Increased permeability for small solutes in brain capillaries means that a change in hydrostatic capillary pressure may influence transcapillary fluid exchange according to the Starling fluid equilibrium. and a high arterial pressure may cause transcapillary fluid filtration and raised intracranial pressure. This could be of clinical relevance in states of disrupted blood-brain barrier such as meningitis and after a severe head injury, especially since these patients quite often are spontaneously hypertensive, and hypertensive therapy is sometimes used to increase cerebral perfusion pressure. This study on cat investigated the long-term relation between arterial pressure and intracranial pressure in a state of disrupted blood-brain barrier.
   Method. Endotoxin was given intrathecally to open the blood-brain barrier and depress cerebral autoregulation. Arterial pressure was increased by about 30 min Hg during 5 hours by dopamine and angiotensin II infusion. The immediate fall in intracranial pressure after normalization of blood pressure reflects the blood volume component of an intracranial pressure increase.
   Results. Increased arterial pressure had no effect on intracranial pressure before endotoxin. Endotoxin infusion increased intracranial pressure from the normal value of 10 to 12 mm Hg. and at steady state by almost 10 mm Hg. Intracranial pressure increased further after the arterial pressure increase. At steady state (achieved within 5 hours), this increase was almost as great as the arterial pressure increase, and about 80% persisted when measured directly after normalization of the arterial pressure.
   Conclusion. Increased arterial pressure in a state of disrupted blood-brain barrier increases intracranial pressure, mainly because of brain edema. This stresses that arterial hypertension may be deleterious in conditions such as meningitis or after a brain trauma.

SP Int Assoc Study Obesity
AB Previous clinical studies of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome noted extremely high cardiac filling (pulmonary arterial and pulmonary capillary wedge) pressures, as high or higher than in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) but most of these patients were not in heart failure. These pressures returned to normal within 6 to 9 months after surgically induced weight loss. High lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures were noted in obese patients with pseudotumor cerebri; resolution of headache and marked decreases in CSF pressures were noted when restudied 34 +/- 8 months following gastric bypass surgery. Female patients with stress overflow urinary incontinence were noted to have extremely high urinary bladder pressures (UBPs) which normalized following surgically induced weight loss. Their pressures were as high, or even higher, than UBPs noted in critically ill patients with an acute abdominal compartment syndrome where treatment is urgent surgical abdominal decompression. It was hypothesized that severely obese patients with central obesity would have a chronic abdominal compartment syndrome with high UBPs and this would be related to a number of obesity comorbidity problems that were probably secondary to an increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). Animal studies demonstrated that increased IAP increased pleural pressure, cardiac filling pressures, femoral venous pressure, renal venous pressure, systemic blood pressure and vascular resistance, renin and aldosterone levels and intracranial pressure. Thus, the co-morbidity presumed secondary to increased IAP in obese patients include CHE hypoventilation, venous stasis ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux, urinary stress incontinence, incisional hernia, pseudotumor cerebri, proteinuria and systemic hypertension. In a study of 84 patients with severe obesity prior to gastric bypass surgery and 5 non-obese patients prior to colectomy for ulcerative colitis it was found that obese patients had a significantly higher UBP (18 +/- 0.7 vs. 7 +/- 1.6 cm H2O, p < 0.001) which correlated with sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD, r = 0.67, p < 0.001) and was greater (p < 0.05) in patients with, than those without, morbidity presumed due to increased IAP. The waist:hip ratio (W:H) correlated with UBP in men (r = 0.6, p <0.05) but not in women (r = -0.3), supporting the concept that SAD is a better reflection of central obesity than W:H. In 15 patients studied before and 1 y after GBP there were significant (p < 0.001) decreases in weight (140 +/- 8 to 87 +/- 6 kg), BMI (52 +/- 3 to 33 +/- 2 kg/m2), SAD (32 +/- 1 to 20 +/- 2 cm), UBP (17 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 1 cm H2O) and obesity co-morbidity with the loss of 69 +/- 4% of excess weight.

TI Dural arteriovenous fistulas as a relative contraindication for lumbar
   puncture: brief report and literature review
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB We report three patients who deteriorated after lumbar puncture (LP). Two patients were later found to have type ii (a + b) dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF) with high flow retrograde venous drainage on cerebral angiography. The third had a type II (a) DAVF. All patients recovered at least partially after DAVF treatment. In patients with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) but no evidence of focal mass lesion on cranial imaging, we suggest an evaluation for a DAVF before performing an LP.

TI Intraabdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome
SO ENFERMEDADES INFECCIOSAS Y MICROBIOLOGIA CLINICA
AB Although intraabdominal pressure (IAP) has been studied for more than 100 years, the concepts of intraabdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartmental syndrome (ACS) have only been developed as clinical entities of interest in intensive care in the last 5 years. At the first Congress on Abdominal Compartment Syndrome in December 2004. a series of definitions were established, which were published in 2006. IAH is defined as IAP >= 12 mmHg and is classified in four severity grades, the maximum grade being ACS, with the development of multiorgan failure.
   The incidence of IAH in patients in intensive care units is high, around 30% at admission and 64% in those with a length of stay of 7 days. The increase in IAP leads to reduced vascular flow to the splenic organs, increased intrathoracic pressure and decreased venous return, with a substantial reduction in cardiac output.
   If IAH persists, these physiopathologic episodes are followed by the development of multiorgan failure with renal, cardiocirculatory and respiratory failure and intestinal ischemia. Mortality from untreated ACS is higher than 60%. The only treatment for ACS is surgical decompression. In patients with moderate IAH, medical treatment should be optimized, based on the following measures: a) serial IAP monitoring; b) optimization of systemic perfusion and the function of the distinct systems in patients with high IAP; c) instauration of specific measures to decrease IAP; and d) early surgical decompression for refractory IAH.
   The application of the medical measures that can reduce IAP and early abdominal decompression in ACS improve survival in critically ill patients with IAH. (c) 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

TI Endovascular Treatment of Cerebral Venous Sinus Stenosis Based on
   Hemodynamic Assessment Using Pressure Wire
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: A pressure wire offers a dynamic tool to assist in the measurement of the pressure gradient and assessment of the functional significance of stenosis. The author presents a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension who was diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS). Venography accompanied by pressure measurement was used to guide the stent placement for CVSS.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a chife complaint of headache and neckache lasting for 7 weeks, with an 8-day history of binocular diplopia and blurred vision. Magnetic resonance venography and digital subtraction angiography showed a filling defect in the right transverse sinus. A pressure wire was used before endovascular treatment and showed that the pressure gradient was 10 mm Hg, which meets the surgical indication. After a stent was placed, no pressure gradient was recorded by the pressure wire.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report about using a pressure wire for CVSS. Then finding suggests that use of a pressure wire can be a new approach in the diagnosis and treatment of CVSS.

TI Understanding jugular venous outflow disturbance
SO CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB Extracranial venous abnormalities, especially jugular venous outflow disturbance, were originally viewed as nonpathological phenomena due to a lack of realization and exploration of their feature and clinical significance. The etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear, whereas a couple of causal factors have been conjectured. The clinical presentation of this condition is highly variable, ranging from insidious to symptomatic, such as headaches, dizziness, pulsatile tinnitus, visual impairment, sleep disturbance, and neck discomfort or pain. Standard diagnostic criteria are not available, and current diagnosis largely depends on a combinatory use of imaging modalities. Although few researches have been conducted to gain evidence-based therapeutic approach, several recent advances indicate that intravenous angioplasty in combination with stenting implantation may be a safe and efficient way to restore normal blood circulation, alleviate the discomfort symptoms, and enhance patients' quality of life. In addition, surgical removal of structures that constrain the internal jugular vein may serve as an alternative or adjunctive management when endovascular intervention is not feasible. Notably, discussion on every aspect of this newly recognized disease entity is in the infant stage and efforts with more rigorous designed, randomized controlled studies in attempt to identify the pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and effective approaches to its treatment will provide a profound insight into this issue.

TI The pulsation and the pressure of the central retinal vein and their
   relation to glaucoma damage and therapy
SO KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE
AB Until now the pressure in the intraocular veins was generally equated with the intraocular pressure. According to recently available knowledge the pressure in the central retinal vein may be considerably higher than the intraocular pressure. Therefore, the pressure in the veins of the prelaminar layer of the optic nerve head may be higher than the intraocular pressure also. In this case the perfusion pressure equals the difference: arterial pressure minus central retinal venous pressure. It has been shown that the central retinal venous pressure is higher in glaucoma patients than in healthy subjects and it is higher in the eyes with the larger excavation in patients with unequal excavations. The central retinal venous pressure is a considerable risk factor for the progression of glaucoma damage. It seems to be appropriate to judge the pulsation of the central retinal vein in glaucoma patients, assessing the risk of glaucoma damage, and to measure the pressure in the central retinal vein by contact lens dynamometry. It may be concluded that a solely pressure-lowering therapy is ineffective in eyes in which the pressure of the central retinal vein is higher than the intraocular pressure. That may apply to about 40-50% of glaucoma patients.

TI Unique variant of idiopathic intracranial hypertension dural sinus
   stenting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Purpose/Aim of the study: To report on the successful treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in a patient with venous sinus stenosis secondary to a persistent occipital-marginal sinus (POMS) utilizing venous sinus stenting. Materials/Methods: A 55-year-old female presented with headaches and blurry vision. Ophthalmologic examination demonstrated papilledema. Two lumbar punctures demonstrated opening pressures of 31 and 38 cmH2O and provided temporary symptom relief. Cerebral venography demonstrated hypoplastic bilateral transverse-sigmoid sinuses with dominant drainage through a persistent occipital-marginal sinus (POMS). Multiple enlarged arachnoid granulations resulted in stenosis in the marginal sinus with an 18 mmHg mean pressure gradient across the stenosis. Results: The decision was made for venous sinus stenting of the POMS. Immediate post-stenting venography demonstrated resolution of the POMS stenosis with flow only into the POMS and a mean pressure gradient across the stenosis normalized to 2 mmHg. Six-month follow-up venography demonstrated continued stent patency and clinical symptoms remained resolved. She has remained symptom free at 18 months. Conclusion: This writing summarizes the utility of endovascular dural sinus stenting and the importance of recognizing the dominant dural sinus drainage route in the treatment of IIH.

TI Surgical Management of Complex Syndromic Craniosynostosis: Experience
   With a Rare Genetic Variant
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis (CS) can present with both intracranial and extracranial manifestations. Extracranial features include proptosis, exorbitism, and midface hypoplasia. Intracranial manifestations can include elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), brainstem compression, foramen magnum stenosis or jugular foramen hypoplasia with resultant venous hypertension and anomalous drainage. While fronto-orbital advancement, cranial vault remodeling, and posterior fossa decompression are standard surgical approaches to normalizing orbitocranial volume and morphology, associated hydrocephalus, anomalous venous drainage, and tonsillar herniation often affect the timing, safety, and selection of corrective interventions. The surgical decision-making to circumvent venous emissaries, effectively time treatment of hydrocephalus, and address posterior versus anterior pathology primarily has not been widely described in the literature, and is important in the development of guidelines in these complex cases. In this report, we describe the surgical management of a patient with Jackson-Weiss syndrome presenting with delayed, but rapidly progressive bilateral lambdoid CS, severe proptosis, midface hypoplasia, elevated ICP, hydrocephalus, tonsillar ectopia, and severe venous hypertension with anomalous drainage. We review the literature related to management of complex synostosis and present our surgical decision-making in the setting of complex syndromic synostosis to aid in the formation of guidelines toward approaching these cases.

TI Fifty shades of gradients: does the pressure gradient in venous sinus
   stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension matter? A systematic
   review
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE The role of venous sinus stenting (VSS) for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is not well understood. The aim of this systematic review is to attempt to identify subsets of patients with IIH who will benefit from VSS based on the pressure gradients of their venous sinus stenosis.
   METHODS MEDLINE/PubMed was searched for studies reporting venous pressure gradients across the stenotic segment of the venous sinus, pre- and post-stent pressure gradients, and clinical outcomes after VSS. Findings are reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.
   RESULTS From 32 eligible studies, a total of 186 patients were included in the analysis. Patients who had favorable outcomes had higher mean pressure gradients (22.8 +/- 11.5 mm Hg vs 17.4 +/- 8.0 mm Hg, p = 0.033) and higher changes in pressure gradients after stent placement (19.4 +/- 10.0 mm Hg vs 12.0 +/- 6.0 mm Hg, p = 0.006) compared with those with unfavorable outcomes. The post-stent pressure gradients between the 2 groups were not significantly different (2.8 +/- 4.0 mm Hg vs 2.7 +/- 2.0 mm Hg, p = 0.934). In a multivariate stepwise logistic regression controlling for age, sex, body mass index, CSF opening pressure, pre-stent pressure gradient, and post-stent pressure gradient, the change in pressure gradient with stent placement was found to be an independent predictor of favorable outcome (p = 0.028). Using a pressure gradient of 21 as a cutoff, 81/86 (94.2%) of patients with a gradient > 21 achieved favorable outcomes, compared with 82/100 (82.0%) of patients with a gradient <= 21 (p = 0.022).
   CONCLUSIONS There appears to be a relationship between the pressure gradient of venous sinus stenosis and the success of VSS in IIH. A randomized controlled trial would help elucidate this relationship and potentially guide patient selection.

TI Control values of intraocular pressure in different species: a review of
   literature
SO CROATIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB It is generally accepted that intraocular pressure (IOP) depends on the rate of aqueous humor production, system outflow resistance, and episcleral venous pressure. Therefore, control IOP values are expected to be within the strict and predictable limits in specific animal species, and there should be no vast differences between species. However, in the literature the control IOP values significantly vary (from potentially "hypotensive" to "hypertensive") within the same species, and especially between species depending on the measurement technique, head position in relation to the rest of the body, circadian rhythm, age, and topical and systemic drugs (anesthetics) applied. These variations make it difficult to compare different therapeutic approaches for intraocular hypertension, investigate the correlation between IOP and intracranial pressure, and determine target IOP values in glaucoma research. We recommend that different IOP physiology and pathophysiology studies take into account all the mentioned factors when describing IOP measurement methodology.

SP ANIRCEF
AB The co-occurrence of epistaxis and headache is not uncommon in migraine patients, although only few case reports have been published. A trigeminovascular activation may be causally involved although the exact mechanisms linking epistaxis and migraine remain unclear. Significant dural sinus stenosis may sustain or worsen an increased cerebral venous pressure and is considered a radiological predictor of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. We report a 49-year-old female patient with chronic migraine associated to stabbing headache-like attacks followed by epistaxis and by the resolution or the significant improvement of pain. As she also reported adjunctive symptoms suggestive of raised intracranial pressure and showed a bilateral narrowing of transverse sinuses at MR-venography, a possible intracranial hypertension was hypothesized despite the lack of papilledema. Acetazolamide 250 mg twice/day was added to therapy and the patient reported sudden reduction of headache severity and frequency and complete resolution of both the stabbing pain and the recurrent epistaxis, maintained for 5 months. At treatment discontinuation she complained the worsening of migraine headache and the reoccurrence of the superimposed stabbing pain followed by epistaxis. The mechanism linking the sequential occurrence of painful stabs, epistaxis and relief from pain with raised intracranial pressure in our patients remains unclear. We speculate that the sudden reopening of collapsed collateral veins of the anterior venous circle, possibly prompted by periodic waves of central venous hypertension coupled with intracranial hypertensive peaks, could explain the unusual strict time succession of painful stabs, epistaxis, and subsequent resolution of pain.

AB Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is a rare condition in which the pathophysiology remains unclear. Multiple theories have been proposed in the past to explain BIH. Today it is widely accepted that the condition occurs in situations where alteration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reabsorption is encountered. The venous System is therefore involved and may be the common denominator of the pathophysiological theories. A distinction must be made between idiopathic benign intracranial hypertension and BIH resulting from drugs, other pathological conditions, or toxics (secondary BIH), which are reported in this paper. We emphasize the crucial role of exhaustive clinical, biological, and neuroradiological investigations aiming to establish the diagnosis of BIH. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

SO ANASTHESIOLOGIE & INTENSIVMEDIZIN
AB Hemodynamic instability in neurosurgical patients caused by hypovolemia should always be treated rapidly and vigorously, Fluid management should aim at the ongoing maintenance of hemodynamic stability, If blood products are not indicated, fluids of choice are: isotonic electrolyte solutions without dextrose and isotonic hydroxyethyl starch, The latter may shorten resuscitation time and prolong hemodynamic stability without harm, if dose is limited, As soon as possible, this therapy should be monitored and guided by measurement of arterial, central venous and intracranial pressures and calculation of cerebral perfusion pressure, Perfusion pressure should be 70 mm Hg or higher, The preferred osmotherapeutic solution is mannitol, Indications for use are: imminent cerebral herniation, lowering of intracranial pressure in critical care, and the intraoperative reduction of brain volume, The necessary monitoring of osmotherapy consists of measurements of urinary output, central venous pressure, plasma electrolytes and plasma osmolarity, Dextrose and hypotonic solutions such as Ringer's lactate increase brain water content by lowering plasma osmolarity, thereby increasing brain tissue volume and raising intracranial pressure, This may further compromise an already disturbed cerebral perfusion, Therefore these solutions should be avoided in neuroanesthesia, In the future, small volume resuscitation with hypertonic-hyperoncotic saline-colloid-solutions may provide initial hemodynamic stability together with a decrease in intracranial pressure and an improvement of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation.

TI Efficacy and Safety of Continuous Micro-Pump Infusion of 3% Hypertonic
   Saline combined with Furosemide to Control Elevated Intracranial
   Pressure
SO MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
AB Background: Elevated intracranial pressure is one of the most common problems in patients with diverse intracranial disorders, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Effective management for increased intracranial pressure is based mainly on surgical and medical techniques with hyperosmolar therapy as one of the core medical treatments. The study aimed to explore the effects of continuous micro-pump infusions of 3% hypertonic saline combined with furosemide on intracranial pressure control.
   Material/Methods: We analyzed data on 56 eligible participants with intracranial pressure > 20 mmHg from March 2013 to July 2014. The target was to increase and maintain plasma sodium to a level between 145 and 155 mmol/L and osmolarity to a level of 310 to 320 mOsmol/kg.
   Results: Plasma sodium levels significantly increased from 138 +/- 5 mmol/L at admission to 151 +/- 3 mmol/L at 24 h (P<0.01). Osmolarity increased from 282 +/- 11 mOsmol/kg at baseline to 311 +/- 8 mOsmol/kg at 24 h (P<0.01). Intracranial pressure significantly decreased from 32 +/- 7 mmHg to 15 +/- 6 mmHg at 24 h (P<0.01). There was a significant improvement in CPP (P<0.01). Moreover, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and Glasgow Coma Scale slightly increased. However, these changes were not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Continuous infusion of 3% hypertonic saline + furosemide is effective and safe for intracranial pressure control.

TI Association of Intracranial Pressure and Spontaneous Retinal Venous
   Pulsation
SO JAMA NEUROLOGY
AB Question Is infrared video assessment of spontaneous venous pulsation useful for identifying patients with elevated intracranial pressure? Findings In this study that included 105 patients, there was a statistically significant association between the grading of spontaneous venous pulsation (assessed through infrared videos) and simultaneous intracranial pressure in patients without papilledema. Meaning Infrared video assessments of spontaneous venous pulsation can be used as a noninvasive method of assessment of intracranial pressure and have the potential to help determine which patients need invasive intracranial pressure monitoring.
   Importance A convenient and reliable method for noninvasive intracranial pressure assessments is desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures (eg, intracranial pressure monitoring and lumbar punctures) and allow clinicians to identify and treat patients with intracranial hypertension in a timely manner. Objective To determine whether infrared video assessment of spontaneous retinal venous pulsation is associated with intracranial pressure and is a valid tool to indicate the presence or absence of raised intracranial pressure in patients without papilledema. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center prospective study was conducted at a tertiary referral center between January 2017 and May 2018. Patients consecutively admitted for clinically indicated elective 24-hour invasive intracranial pressure monitoring had ophthalmic review including infrared video recording of their spontaneous venous pulsation. Two neuro-ophthalmologists, who were masked to the intracranial pressure monitoring results, independently graded the spontaneous venous pulsation (grade 0 to 3). Analysis began in June 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures The association between simultaneously recorded intracranial pressure and spontaneous venous pulsation (binary variable: present/absent) assessed through retinal infrared video recordings was evaluated using a multiple linear regression model. Results Of 105 patients, the mean (SD) age was 39 (14) years, and 79 (75%) were women. The mean (SD) simultaneous intracranial pressure was 1 (5) mm Hg for 91 patients (86.7%) with spontaneous venous pulsations and 13 (14) mm Hg for 14 patients (13.3%) without spontaneous venous pulsations. A multiple linear regression model adjusted for 7 potential confounders confirmed a statistically significant association between intracranial pressure and spontaneous venous pulsation (beta = -9.1; 95% CI, -13.7 to -4.6; P < .001; adjusted R-2 = 0.42). Conclusions and Relevance The absence of spontaneous venous pulsation on retinal infrared video recordings is significantly associated with higher levels of intracranial pressure and should raise the suspicion of intracranial hypertension.
   This study determines whether infrared video assessment of spontaneous retinal venous pulsation is associated with intracranial pressure and is a valid tool to indicate the presence or absence of raised intracranial pressure in patients without papilledema.

AB Background: Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and reduces cerebral pel fusion pressure (CPP). We evaluated a nonsurgical means of reducing IAP to reverse this process,
   Methods: Swine with a baseline ICP of 25 mm Hg produced by an intracranial balloon catheter were studied. In group 1 (n = 5), IAP was increased by 25 mm Hg. Continuous negative abdominal pressure (CNAP) was then applied, Group 2 (n = 4) had neither IAP elevation nor CNAP. Group 3 (n = 4) had CNAP without IAP elevation.
   Results: Elevation of IAP by 25 mm Hg above baseline led to deleterious changes in ICP (25.8 +/- 0.8 to 39.0 +/- 2.8; p < 0.05) and CPP (85.2 +/- 2.0 to 64.8 +/- 2.6; p < 0.05), CNAP led to a reduction in IAP (30.2 +/- 1.2 to 20.4 +/- 1.3: p < 0.05) and improvements in cerebral perfusion (ICP, 33 +/- 2.7; CPP, 74.4 +/- 1.2; both p < 0.05). Group 2 had stable ICP (25.8 +/- 0.25 to 28.7 +/- 1.7: p > 0.05) and CPP (80.8 +/- 1.4 to 80.5 +/- 1.8; p > 0.05. In group 3, CNAP decreased cardiac index (2.9 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.4; p < 0.05). mean arterial pressure (105.2 +/- 4.0 to 38.2 +/- 12.0; p < 0.05), and CPP (74.2 +/- 4.7 to 14.5 +/- 12.2; p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Elevations in IAP led to increased ICP and decreased CPP, CNAP ameliorated these intracranial disturbances, With normal IAP, CNAP impaired cerebral perfusion.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension; research progress and emerging
   themes
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterised by increased intracranial pressure of unknown cause predominantly seen in obese women of childbearing age and associated with a history of recent weight gain. The aetiology is poorly understood and there are no evidence-based guidelines on the management of the disease. We aim to provide a review of the recent literature outlining the latest advances in this field over the past few years. Areas of emerging interest related to the pathophysiology of IIH will be discussed, such as the role of obesity, adipose tissue and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. We consider the latest research on the role of venous sinus stenosis in IIH and ex vivo advances into cerebrospinal fluid drainage via the arachnoid granulation tissue. The latest techniques for optic nerve head evaluation and the role of optical coherence tomography will be summarised. Finally, we will discuss recent advances in the management of IIH, including weight loss, and medical and surgical treatment strategies.

TI Intracranial pressure changes during intermittent CSF drainage
SO PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY
AB Premature very-low-birth-weight infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus are often managed with intermittent cerebrospinal fluid drainage from a ventricular reservoir. There are little data regarding intracranial pressure changes during intermittent drainage to determine the amount and frequency of cerebrospinal fluid removal or to determine the correct resistance of future programmable shunts. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using a commercially available intracranial pressure transducer to measure changes in pressure associated with this procedure. Continuous intracranial pressure was measured in three infants with a transducer placed at the time of ventricular reservoir insertion. Daily reservoir taps began 48 hours after placement and intracranial pressure was monitored for 7 days. Intracranial pressure before the initial tap was comparable to levels previously reported as normal. The daily removal of 10 cc/kg of cerebrospinal fluid was sufficient to lower intracranial pressure below baseline, however it was associated with wide swings in pressure and, in one patient, sustained negative pressure. The use of direct intracranial pressure monitoring may be useful in determining the optimal amount and frequency of cerebrospinal drainage from infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus managed with a ventricular reservoir, as well as determining resistance settings of subsequent programmable shunts.

TI Pulsatile tinnitus and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea:
   Indicators of benign intracranial hypertension syndrome
SO OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY
AB Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) syndrome occurs most frequently in young obese women. Pulsatile tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss may be a patient's primary symptoms at presentation (1). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea occasionally results from BIH syndrome and may be secondary to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) resulting from the high intra-abdominal pressure of a morbidly obese individual (2). We report a case of pulsatile tinnitus and CSF rhinorrhea caused by BIH syndrome that resolved after surgery for morbid obesity. We urge the otolaryngologist to consider BIH syndrome as a possible diagnosis in patients presenting with pulsatile tinnitus and CSF rhinorrhea and encourage an evaluation for treatment of obesity as a primary therapeutic goal.

TI Management of Intracranial Pressure
SO CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS
AB Although intracranial hypertension may arise from diverse pathology, several basic principles remain paramount to understanding its dynamics; however, the management of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) may be very complex. Initial management of common ICP exacerbants is important, such as addressing venous outflow obstruction with upright midline head positioning and treating agitation and pain with sedation and analgesia. Surgical decompression of mass effect may rapidly improve ICP elevation, but the impact on outcome is unclear. Considerable effort has been put forth to understand the roles of multimodal intensive care monitoring, osmolar therapy, cerebral metabolic suppression, and temperature augmentation in the advanced management of elevated ICP. Establishing a protocol-driven approach to the management of ICP enables the rapid bedside assessment of multiple physiologic variables to implement appropriate treatments, which limit the risk of developing secondary brain injury.

TI Endovascular stenting for cerebral venous sinus stenosis secondary to
   meningioma invasion
SO NEURORADIOLOGY
AB IntroductionSymptomatic intracranial hypertension (IH) due to venous outflow obstruction secondary to dural venous sinus (DVS) tumoral invasion affects up to 3% of intracranial meningioma patients. The literature regarding endovascular therapies of such patients is limited to a few case reports and a recent single-centre case series.PurposeWe describe our single-centre experience of endovascular therapy in patients with clinically symptomatic IH secondary to DVS meningioma invasion.MethodsWe performed a retrospective review of clinical and radiological data of all patients with refractory IH and meningiomas invading the DVS who were referred for possible DVS venoplasty and stenting. Seven endovascular procedures in six female patients were done. Presumed secondarily induced lateral transverse sinus stenosis was also stented in four patients as part of the primary intervention.ResultsAll patients experienced complete symptomatic resolution at 6-month follow-up. Five patients had no symptom recurrence over a mean follow-up period of 3.5 years. One patient with multiple meningiomas developed recurrent IH 2 years following stenting secondary to in-stent tumour re-invasion. This was re-stented with consequent 6 months post-retreatment symptomatic relief at the time of writing. No procedure-related complications occurred.ConclusionIn the setting of DVS stenosis secondary to meningioma invasion, endovascular therapy is a safe and successful therapeutic option with promising mid-term results. The procedure should be considered in cases where complete surgical tumour resection is unlikely or carries a significant risk. If present, secondarily induced stenoses at the lateral ends of the transverse sinuses should also be considered for treatment.

SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB The use of surgical treatment for depressed skull fractures that are located over major venous sinuses is a matter of controversy. However, if clinical and radiological findings of sinus obliteration and related intracranial hypertension are present, surgical decompression is indicated. The authors present the case of a 38-year-old man who had a depressed skull fracture overlying the posterior one-third portion of the superior sagittal sinus. The lesion was initially treated conservatively and the patient was readmitted 1 month later with signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. The role of radiological investigation in the detection of venous sinus flow and indications for surgical treatment are discussed. If venous sinus flow obstruction is revealed in the presence of signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension, surgery is indicated as the first line of treatment.

TI EFFECTS OF ARTERIAL AND VENOUS-PRESSURE ALTERATIONS ON TRANSCAPILLARY
   FLUID EXCHANGE DURING RAISED TISSUE PRESSURE
SO INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: To assess local haemodynamic effects of raised tissue pressure per se and of arterial and venous pressure variations during raised tissue pressure, and to evaluate the vascular waterfall phenomenon.
   Design: An isolated pump-perfused sympathectomised cat skeletal muscle enclosed in a plethysmograph.
   Interventions: Hydrostatic capillary pressure (P-c), tissue volume alterations and blood flow were recorded at various arterial (P-A) or venous (P-v) pressure levels at a raised tissue pressure (P-tissue). Total vascular resistance (R(tot)) and its three consecutive sections, arterial resistance (R(art)), venular resistance (R(venule)), and venous outflow orifice resistance (R(orifice)), were recorded.
   Results: Increase in P-tissue increased P-c due to a marked increase in R(orifice) and unchanged R(art) and, when P-tissue>P-v, by about 90% of the P-tissue increase. During the raised P-tissue a P-A increase (95 to 115 mmHg) increased P-c (by 3.1+/-1.1 mmHg) causing fluid filtration, and a PA decrease (95 to 75 mmHg) decreased P-c (by 2.4+/-0.5 mmHg) causing fluid absorption. R(art) was unchanged, indicating impaired autoregulation. Increased P-v had no haemodynamic effects when P-v<P-tissue due to a gradual decrease in R(orifice) towards zero when P-v reached P-tissue. At P-v>P-tissue blood flow and P-c increased gradually, causing fluid filtration.
   Conclusions: Tissue volume is increased by raised and decreased by lowered P-A, the latter may be of use to decrease ICP in the injured brain. The results indicate that PEEP or head elevation will not influence ICP from the venous side if CVP<ICP. Finally, the ''vascular waterfall phenomenon'' was rejected as R(orifice) is a normal variable fluid resistance.

TI Intracranial-to-central venous pressure gap predicts the responsiveness
   of intracranial pressure to PEEP in patients with traumatic brain
   injury: a prospective cohort study
SO BMC NEUROLOGY
AB Background Mechanical ventilation (MV) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is commonly applied in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). However, the individual responsiveness of intracranial pressure (ICP) to PEEP varies. Thus, identifying an indicator detecting ICP responsiveness to PEEP is of great significance. As central venous pressure (CVP) could act as an intermediary to transduce pressure from PEEP to ICP, we developed a new indicator, P(IC)Gap, representing the gap between baseline ICP and baseline CVP. The aim of the current study was to explore the relationship between P(IC)Gap and ICP responsiveness to PEEP. Methods A total of 112 patients with sTBI undergoing MV were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. ICP, CVP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), static compliance of the respiratory system (Cst), and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PetCO(2)) were recorded at the initial (3 cmH(2)O) and adjusted (15 cmH(2)O) levels of PEEP. P(IC)Gap was assessed as baseline ICP - baseline CVP (when PEEP = 3 cmH(2)O). The patients were classified into the ICP responder and non-responder groups based on whether ICP increment with PEEP adjusted from 3 cmH(2)O to 15 cmH(2)O was greater than 20% of baseline ICP. The above parameters were compared between the two groups, and prediction of ICP responsiveness to PEEP adjustment was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results Compared with the non-responder group, the responder group had lower P(IC)Gap (1.63 +/- 1.33 versus 6.56 +/- 2.46 mmHg; p < 0.001), lower baseline ICP, and higher baseline CVP. ROC curve analysis suggested that P(IC)Gap was a stronger predictive indicator of ICP responsiveness to PEEP (AUC = 0.957, 95%CI 0.918-0.996; p < 0.001) compared with baseline ICP and baseline CVP, with favorable sensitivity (95.24, 95%CI 86.91-98.70%) and specificity (87.6, 95%CI 75.76-94.27%), at a cut off value of 2.5 mmHg. Conclusion The impact of PEEP on ICP depends on the gap between baseline ICP and baseline CVP, i.e. P(IC)Gap. In addition, P(IC)Gap is a potential predictor of ICP responsiveness to PEEP adjustment in patients with sTBI.

TI Retinal and Optic Nerve Deformations Due to Orbital Versus Intracranial
   Venous Hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Introduction: Abnormal forces around the optic nerve head (ONH) due to orbital diseases, intracranial hypertension (IH), glaucoma, and space travel, are associated with alterations of the ONH shape. Elevated cerebral and ophthalmic venous pressure can contribute to stress and strain on the ONH and peripapillary retina. We hypothesize that IH and elevated ophthalmic venous pressure without IH cause different ONH and retinal changes. Methods: We compared MRI and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) findings in patients with cavernous sinus arteriovenous shunts (CSAVSs), where orbital venous pressure is known to be elevated, with patients with intracranial dural venous sinus thrombosis and secondary IH. We also compared the results to those obtained in the Idiopathic IH (IIH) Treatment Trial. Results: Among 18 patients with dural venous sinus thrombosis, the MRI/magnetic resonance venography displayed partial empty sella (61%) and optic nerve sheath distension (67%). None exhibited ophthalmic vein dilation or signs of orbital congestion. SDOCT of these eyes and IIH eyes showed a similar frequency of abnormal thickening of the mean retinal nerve fiber layer, anterior displacement of the basement membrane opening, peripapillary wrinkles, retinal folds (RF), and choroidal folds (CF). Among 21 patients with CSAVSs, MRI showed ipsilateral dilated superior ophthalmic vein (76%) and orbital congestion (52%) without distension of the optic nerve sheath or globe distortion. SDOCT showed CF (19%), one with overlying RF, and no ONH deformations. Conclusions: SDOCT findings for dural venous sinus thrombosis are similar to those seen with IIH but distinct from changes due to local ophthalmic venous hypertension. These data support the concept that IH even if due to a vascular cause and local orbital venous hypertension cause different stresses and strains on the ONH.

TI Augmented 3D venous navigation for neuroendovascular procedures
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Endovascular venous access is increasingly used for the treatment of many cerebrovascular diseases. The quality of venous roadmapping through arterial injection can be problematic because of contrast media dilution, slow flow velocity, and unilateral opacification of the venous system.
   Objective To describe our experience with the VesselNavigator (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) in performing live 3D roadmapping for intracranial venous procedures.
   Material and methods Live 3D roadmapping is an image-processing technique that allows dynamic roadmapping of vessels with immediate adaptation to the C-arm movements without the need for contrast injection. For this purpose, 3D MR venography is overlaid on live fluoroscopy images after semiautomatic coregistration. The technique was applied to cases of idiopathic venous stenosis and arteriovenous fistula.
   Results The process of coregistration was performed by the principal operator in <5 min, just before the treatment. The accuracy was controlled peroperatively and was judged satisfactory. Three illustrative cases demonstrate the use of this software for venous navigation and pressure measurement (case 1), venous stenting (case 2), and transvenous embolization of a carotid-cavernous fistula (case 3).
   Conclusion Our preliminary experience suggests that it is a feasible and safe technique for intracranial venous navigation and procedures. The potential lowering of overall radiation dose and contrast media use needs to be verified with further studies.

AB Transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) is an abnormality in the cerebral venous system in which the narrowing of the transverse sinus of the brain leads to obstructed cerebral venous outflow. It is an infrequent, incidental radiological finding. However, it is not uncommon among patients with chronic headaches of unclear cause, particularly those that remain unexplained after initial evaluation or those that are refractory to medical treatment. Its diagnosis frequently eludes the initial workup, and a high degree of suspicion should be maintained since its identification can lead to potentially curative treatment. This report describes the case of a 36-year-old female with a history of chronic headache who was found to have TSS. This paper discusses its etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, radiological findings, and management.

TI Intracranial pressure in unresponsive chronic migraine
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB To assess the prevalence and possible pathogenetic involvement of raised intracranial pressure in patients presenting with unresponsive chronic migraine (CM), we evaluated the intracranial opening pressure (OP) and clinical outcome of a single cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal by lumbar puncture in 44 consecutive patients diagnosed with unresponsive chronic/transformed migraine and evidence of sinus stenosis at magnetic resonance venography. The large majority of patients complained of daily or near-daily headache. Thirty-eight (86.4 %) had an OP > 200 mmH(2)O. Lumbar puncture-induced normalization of intracranial pressure resulted in prompt remission of chronic pain in 34/44 patients (77.3 %); and an episodic pattern of headache was maintained for 2, 3 and 4 months in 24 (54.6 %), 20 (45.4 %) and 17 (38.6 %) patients, respectively. The medians of overall headache days/month and of disabling headache days/month significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) at each follow-up versus baseline. Despite the absence of papilledema, 31/44 (70.5 %) patients fulfilled the ICHD-II criteria for "Headache attributed to Intracranial Hypertension". Our findings indicate that most patients diagnosed with unresponsive CM in specialized headache clinics may present an increased intracranial pressure involved in the progression and refractoriness of pain. Moreover, a single lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal results in sustained remission of chronic pain in many cases. Prospective controlled studies are needed before this procedure can be translated into clinical practice. Nonetheless, we suggest that intracranial hypertension without papilledema should be considered in all patients with almost daily migraine pain, with evidence of sinus stenosis, and unresponsive to medical treatment referred to specialized headache clinics.

TI Successful venous sinus stenting for management of idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension in a 2 year old: A case report
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Our understanding of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is still evolving. Its management is challenging and venous sinus stenting has been reported an alternative to cerebrospinal fluid diversion in adult patients with underlying venous sinus stenosis. Out of very few patients reported with venous sinus stenting in the literature, only one has been an adolescent. We report a case of a 2-year-old with idiopathic intracranial hypertension successfully treated with transverse sinus stenting with good outcome. Venous sinus stenting is a safe treatment option in the management of refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension even in young children. We present the youngest patient to have successfully undergone this treatment.

TI Use of Multidirectional Cranial Distraction Osteogenesis for Cranial
   Expansion in Syndromic Craniosynostosis
SO PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
AB Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis often require a large amount of cranial expansion to avoid intracranial hypertension, but the surgical procedure remains controversial. A patient of severe syndromic craniosynostosis with multiple bony defects and anomalous venous drainage at the occipital region was treated by multidirectional cranial distraction osteogenesis (MCDO) at the age of 8 months. Distraction started 5 days after surgery and ceased on postoperative day 16. The distraction devices were removed 27 days after completing distraction. After device removal, the increase of intracranial volume was 155 ml and the cephalic index was improved from 115.5 to 100.5. The resultant cranial shape was well maintained with minimal relapse at postoperative 9 months. In cases of syndromic craniosynostosis with multiple bony defects and/or anomalous venous drainage at the occipital region, expansion of the anterior cranium by MCDO is a viable alternative to conventional methods.

SO JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB The role of the venous circulation in neurological diseases has been underestimated. In this review, we present an overview of the intracranial venous anatomy, venous disorders of the central nervous system, and options for endovascular management. We discuss the role the venous circulation plays in various neurological diseases including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) disorders (intracranial hypertension and intracranial hypotension), arteriovenous diseases, and pulsatile tinnitus. We also shed light on emergent cerebral venous interventions including transvenous brain-computer interface implantation, transvenous treatment of communicating hydrocephalus, and the endovascular treatment of CSF-venous disorders.

TI Vitreous Hemorrhage as the Presenting Sign of Idiopathic Intracranial
   Hypertension
SO CASE REPORTS IN OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Vitreous hemorrhage from papilledema has rarely been reported in the literature. It likely results from an acute increase in intracranial pressure leading to venous compression and rupture. We herein describe a 32-year-old woman who presented with flashes and floaters and was found to have vitreous hemorrhage due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). She was treated with acetazolamide, and at 6-month follow-up, regained normal visual function with resolution of optic nerve swelling and hemorrhage. Our case demonstrates that patients with IIH may rarely present with floaters due to vitreous hemorrhage from papilledema. This case also re-iterates that the extent and presence of vitreous and optic disc hemorrhage likely does not confer a prognostic value in patients with papilledema.

TI Abdominal compartment syndrome: an emergency department perspective
SO EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB Compartment syndromes can occur in many body regions. Abdominal compartment syndrome, initially described many years ago, has become increasingly recognised in critical care patients. The key points regarding its definition, pathophysiology, aetiology and treatment are described and discussed. Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined as an intra-abdominal pressure >20 mm Hg with evidence of organ dysfunction. At risk patients should be identified in the emergency department and early monitoring of intra- abdominal pressure instituted. Interventions in the emergency department potentially contribute to the development of abdominal compartment syndrome during subsequent phases of care. The need to ensure an early multidisciplinary approach in the management of this complex condition is essential for the best possible patient outcome.

TI Sepsis, venous return, and teleology
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB An understanding of heart-circulation interaction is crucial to our ability to guide our patients through an episode of septic shock. Our knowledge has advanced greatly in the last one hundred years. There are, however, certain empirical phenomena that may lead us to question the wisdom of our prevailing treatment algorithm. Three extreme but iatrogenically possible haemodynamic states exist. Firstly, inappropriately low venous return; secondly, overzealous arteriolar constriction; and finally, misguided inotropy and chronotropy. Following an unsuccessful fluid challenge, it would be logical to first set the venous tone, then set the cardiac rate and contractility, and finally set the peripheral vascular resistance. It is hypothesized that a combination of dihydroergotamine, milrinone and esmolol should be superior to a combination of noradrenaline and dobutamine for surviving sepsis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI EFFECTS OF POSITIVE END-EXPIRATORY PRESSURE ON INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE AND
   COMPLIANCE IN BRAIN-INJURED PATIENTS
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Hypoxic pulmonary disorders and head injuries associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) frequently co-exist. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improves hypoxemia but is reported to impede cerebral venous return, potentially causing a further increase in ICP. The effects of PEEP on ICP were examined at different levels of brain compliance. Continuous ICP recordings were obtained after insertion of Scott cannulas to the lateral ventricles of 7 comatose patients. Brain compliance was assessed by calculation of the pressure volume index. Patients were maintained in a 30.degree. head-up position. Maintenance of PEEP to levels of 40 cm H2O pressure for as long as 18 h did not increase ICP in patients with either normal or low intracranial compliance, and did not increase ICP in the absence of pulmonary disease. Central venous pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure increased proportionately as PEEP was increased. No consistent changes were found in blood pressure recordings, nor were there any reductions in cardiac output found during the studies. Abrupt discontinuation of PEEP did not result in increased ICP except for a transient rise on 2 occasions when respiratory secretions became copious and the patients were inadequately ventilated. Improved oxygenation in 2 patients as a result of PEEP was concomitant with improved intracranial compliance and neurological status. In patients with brain injuries, PEEP improved arterial oxygenation without increasing ICP as previously supposed. Consequently, PEEP is a valuable form of therapy for the comatose patient with pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.

TI FUNDUS HEMORRHAGES IN INFANCY
SO SURVEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB The anatomical location and appearance of retinal hemorrhages in the infant provide important clues in the diagnosis of underlying disorders. While neonatal retinal hemorrhages related to birth trauma are common, benign, and self-limited, other retinal hemorrhages in infancy may signify intracranial aneurysms, accidental or non-accidental injury, and a variety of ocular (e.g., Coats' disease, PHPV, ROP, retinal dysplasia, hypertension, myopia) or systemic disease. (e.g., hematologic or cardiovascular disorders, infection, protein C deficiency). In this review, retinal hemorrhages are illustrated and classified according to location, appearance, and etiology. Prompt diagnosis of retinal hemorrhages in infants is crucial, because treatment may be required to prevent early deprivation amblyopia and blindness. Ophthalmological findings may also be a valuable contribution to the overall medical evaluation of the infant.

TI Incidence and clinical pattern of the abdominal compartment syndrome
   after "damage-control" laparotomy in 311 patients with severe abdominal
   and/or pelvic trauma
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: To investigate the incidence, main physiologic effects, and therapeutic management of the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) after severe abdominal and/or pelvic trauma.
   Design: Retrospective analysis from January 1991 to December 1996; prospective study from January 1997 to August 1998.
   Setting: Level I trauma center, intensive care unit.
   Patients: A total of 311 patients with severe abdominal and/or pelvic trauma and "damage-control" laparotomy on day of admission.
   Interventions: The ACS was defined as the development of significant respiratory compromise, including elevated inspiratory pressure of >35 mbar, a decreased Horowitz quotient (<150 torr [<20 kPa]), renal dysfunction (urine output, <30 mL/hr), hemodynamic instability necessitating catecholamines, and a rigid or tense abdomen. Beginning with January 1997, urinary bladder pressure as an additional variable for the diagnosis of ACS was continuously measured in patients (n = 12) at risk. Bladder pressures of >25 mm Hg indicated ACS.
   Measurements and Main Results:Seventeen patients (5.5%) developed ACS because of persistent intra-abdominal/retroperitoneal bleeding (n = 12; 70.6%) or visceral edema (n = 5; 29.4%). All patients with ACS underwent primary fascial closure. In eight of these patients (47%), abdominal and/or pelvic packing for hemostasis was performed. All patients with AGS required decompressive emergency laparotomies because of physiologic derangements. The time between primary laparotomy and decompressive laparotomy was 12.9 +/- 2.0 hrs. Emergency decompression of the abdomen resulted in a significant increase in the cardiac index (+146%), tidal volume (+133%), Horowitz quotient (+156%), and urine output (+1557%), whereas bladder pressure (-63%), heart rate (-19%), central Venous pressure (-30%), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (-43%), peak airway pressure (-31%), partial pressure arterial carbon dioxide (-30%), and lactate (-40%) markedly (p < .05) decreased. In two multiply injured patients with additional head trauma, ACS caused a critical increase of the intracranial pressure, which markedly dropped after the release of abdominal tension.
   Conclusions: Risk factors for the occurrence of ACS are severe abdominal and/or pelvic trauma, which require laparotomy and packing for the control of hemorrhage. The ACS occurs within hours and causes life-threatening physiologic derangements and a critical rise in intracranial pressure in patients with combined abdominal/pelvic and head trauma. Decompressive laparotomy immediately restores impaired organ functions. In patients at risk, the continuous measurement of urinary bladder pressure as a simple, noninvasive, and less expensive diagnostic tool for early detection of elevated intra-abdominal pressure is mandatory.

TI THE DELTA VALVE - A PHYSIOLOGICAL SHUNT SYSTEM
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB PS Medical has advanced the state-of-the-art in hydrocephalus valve technology with the introduction of the Delta Valve. The Delta Valve is designed upon the premise that the shunted patient should have intracranial pressure (ICP) maintenance within a normal range regardless of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow rate or body position. All previous valves have performance characteristics that are greatly influenced by the negative hydrostatic pressure caused by the gravitational effect on the vertical water column in the distal catheter. This negative pressure influence is non-physiologic and contributes directly to overdrainage that can cause slit ventricles, subdural hematoma, and proximal catheter occlusions. The Delta Valve is the only valve that maintains a near-constant pressure gradient regardless of flow rate or patient posture. It automatically adjusts for increasing negative pressures in the distal catheter by proportionally increasing its resistance to flow, thus nullifying the adverse effects of the hydrostatic force on intracranial pressures. The result is a shunt system that provides for CSF drainage while allowing the patient's normal physiologic conditions to control ICP. The early use of the Delta Valve in the treatment of hydrocephalus may reduce the incidence of the dramatic complications associated with overdrainage.

TI A case of idiopathic intracranial hypertension associated with PCOS
SO CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare neurologic disorder. It is also known as pseudotumor cerebri. The incidence of IIH is one to two per 100,000 population annually. The higher incidence is in obese women from 15 to 44 years. The main symptoms are headache and visual loss. It mostly affects women of childbearing age who are overweight or obese. There are many theories of pathogenesis of IIH, but precise pathogenesis is unknown. One of the causes of 1111 is intracranial venous sinus thrombosis. It can cause increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure by obstruction of venous outflow and blocking of CSF absorption. In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients, thrombogenic tendency is increased due to increased aromatization of testosterone to estradiol which could induce estrogen-mediated thrombophilia. The authors present a 14-year-old girl with PCOS stigma who presented with a severe headache and papilledema. These symptoms were not improved by standard medical therapy of IIH and PCOS, but improved after laparoscopic ovarian drilling. The authors report it with a review of the literature.

TI Hemangioblastomatosis-associated negative-pressure hydrocephalus managed
   with improvised shunt
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is a rare clinical diagnosis, characterized by neurologic decline and ventriculomegaly that persists despite normal to low intracranial pressure. LPH is typically managed by negative-pressure drainage via ventriculostomy, followed by low-resistance shunt insertion. We present the case of a middle-aged man with a history of hemangioblastomatosis who had spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. He was treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and then underwent resection of a Meckel's cave hemangioblastoma and whole brain irradiation. One month later, he presented to us with worsening symptoms and hydrocephalus despite shunt interrogations and revisions revealing no malfunction. Ventriculostomy drainage at negative-pressure was required for resolution of symptoms and ventriculomegaly, leading us to a diagnosis of LPH. This was successfully treated using an improvised ultra-low pressure valveless ventriculoperitoneal shunt, with maintained resolution of LPH for over one year. The system was created by ligating the distal slit valve end of a peritoneal catheter to prevent reflux and allow sub-zero pressure drainage by siphoning. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Ocular perfusion pressure is not reduced in response to lower body
   negative pressure
SO NPJ MICROGRAVITY
AB Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) has been proposed as a countermeasure to mitigate the cephalad fluid shift occurring during spaceflight, which may be associated with the development of Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). This study quantifies the effect of LBNP on intraocular pressure (IOP), mean arterial pressure at eye level (MAP(eye)), and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP). Twenty-four subjects (12 male, 12 female) were subjected to graded LBNP in 0 degrees supine and 15 degrees head-down tilt (HDT) postures from 0 mmHg to -50 mmHg in 10 mmHg increments. IOP decreased significantly with LBNP pressure in 0 degrees supine (by 0.7 +/- 0.09 mmHg per 10 mmHg LBNP pressure, p < 0.001) and in 15 degrees HDT (by 1.0 +/- 0.095 mmHg per 10 mmHg of LBNP pressure, p < 0.001). MAP(eye) significantly decreased by 0.9 +/- 0.4 mmHg per 10 mmHg of LBNP pressure in 0 degrees supine (p = 0.016) but did not significantly change with LBNP in 15 degrees HDT (p = 0.895). OPP did not significantly change with LBNP in 0 degrees supine (p = 0.539) but it significantly increased in 15 degrees HDT at 1.0 +/- 0.3 mmHg per 10 mmHg of LBNP pressure (p = 0.010). Sex did not have a significant effect on OPP, MAP(eye), or IOP in any condition. In 15 degrees HDT, the reduction in IOP during increasing negative pressure, combined with the relatively constant MAP(eye), led to the increase in OPP. Furthermore, results suggest that LBNP, while effective in reducing IOP, is not effective in reducing OPP across all postures investigated.

TI Intravenous mannitol in status migrainosus treatment: a clinical case
   series

AB Status migrainosus (SM) is defined as a severe migraine attack, usually poorly responsive to treatments, lasting more than 72 h. Recurrent SM predicts chronic migraine (CM) development in 83.7% of cases. There is evidence that in most unresponsive CM patients a sinus stenosis-associated raised intracranial pressure is causatively involved in migraine chronification. To test the hypothesis that SM may reflect a sustained rise in intracranial pressure, we tested the efficacy of a 3-day treatment with intravenous mannitol 18% 250 ml b.i.d. in seven subjects presenting with a SM unresponsive to common treatments, showing unilateral or bilateral sinus stenosis at magnetic resonance venography. Mannitol infusion induced the abrupt reduction or the disappearance of pain in all patients, at least along the 3 days of treatment. While the benefit was only observed during the days of treatment in two subjects, in the remaining five patients the time to the next headache was delayed between 20 days to 5 weeks after mannitol infusion. Due to the lack of any analgesic property of mannitol, our data indicate that in this series a rise in intracranial pressure was involved in SM causative mechanisms.

TI Venous Sinus Stenting for Cerebrospinal Fluid Leaks in Setting of
   Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension-An Institutional Series and
   Systematic Review of Literature
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY PART B-SKULL BASE
AB Introduction Chronic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can erode the skull base and cause CSF leaks, necessitating surgical repair or other interventions. Venous sinus stenting (VSS) may restore normal CSF reabsorption and flow, reducing elevated pressures and warranting further investigation as a treatment for IIH-related CSF leaks.
   Methods We retrospectively reviewed charts of IIH patients who underwent VSS for CSF leak repair, analyzing clinical presentation, imaging, treatment, and follow-up. A systematic review of PubMed and Embase was conducted, with continuous variables reported as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs).
   Results We included two institutional cases and seven cases from the systematic review. Median age was 51 years (35-53), with eight female and six obese patients. Among six patients with prior confirmed IIH, four of five treated with acetazolamide were refractory. All presented with CSF rhinorrhea, six had a history of leaks, and four were recurrences. Seven had bony dehiscence. All had bilateral venous stenosis with a pressure gradient of 6 mmHg (3-8.25) and underwent unilateral VSS, with one patient also undergoing angioplasty. Over a 12-month follow-up (11-27), leaks resolved in all patients but one within 3 months (0.875-3). Four had recurrences by 7.15 months (4.8-9); one resolved spontaneously, another after angioplasty, and two required ventriculoperitoneal shunting. One patient underwent additional dural grafting for new sphenoid dehiscence, achieving resolution.
   Conclusion VSS can be an effective initial treatment for IIH-related CSF leaks; but if VSS does not adequately address underlying intracranial pressures, additional medical and surgical interventions are warranted to prevent recurrent leaks.

TI Changes in mean arterial pressure and end-tidal carbon dioxide content
   affect venous sinus pressures in patients with idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension: a randomized study
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Introduction Little is known about how changes in physiologic parameters affect venous sinus pressure measurements, waveforms, or gradients associated with sinus stenosis. Objective To evaluate the effect of changes in cardiovascular and respiratory physiologic parameters on venous sinus pressure and caliber measurements in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) undergoing venous sinus stenting. Methods In a prospective, randomized pilot study, eight patients with IIH undergoing venous sinus stenting were randomized to one of two groups. Under general anesthesia, patients underwent venous manometry and waveform recordings twice in succession based on assigned physiologic groups immediately before stenting. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) group maintained normocapnia but modified MAPs in two arms to control for temporal confounding: group A1 (MAP 60-80 mm Hg then 100-110 mm Hg) and group A2 (MAP 100-110 mm Hg then 60-80 mm Hg). The end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) group maintained a high-normal MAP similar to standard neuroanesthesia goals and modified EtCO2: group B1 (EtCO(2)24-26 mm Hg then 38-40 mm Hg) and B2 (EtCO(2)28-40 mm Hg then 24-26 mm Hg). Results In group A, superior sagittal sinus (SSS) pressures (ranging from 8 to 76 mm Hg) and trans-stenotic pressure gradients (TSPGs) (ranging from 2 to 67 mm Hg) were seen at MAP of 100-110 mm Hg compared with SSS pressures (4-38 mm Hg) and TSPGs (3-31 mm Hg) at 60-80 mm Hg. In group B, SSS pressures and TSPGs were considerably higher at EtCO(2)levels of 38-40 mm Hg (15-57 mm Hg and 3-44 mm Hg, respectively) than at 24-26 mm Hg (8-26 mm Hg and 1-8 mm Hg, respectively). Conclusions Despite the small sample size, this pilot study demonstrates a dramatic effect of both MAP and EtCO(2)on venous sinus pressures obtained during venography. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining normal physiologic cardiovascular and respiratory parameters during venous sinus manometry.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: 12 cases treated by venous sinus
   stenting
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: The high pressures documented in the intracranial venous sinuses in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) could be the result of focal stenotic lesions in the lateral sinuses obstructing cranial venous outflow.
   Objective: To explore the relation between venous sinus disease and IIH.
   Methods: 12 patients with refractory IIH had dilatation and stenting of the venous sinuses after venography and manometry had shown intracranial venous hypertension proximal to stenoses in the lateral sinuses. Intrasinus pressures were recorded before and after the procedure and correlated with clinical outcome.
   Results: Intrasinus pressures were variably reduced by stenting. Five patients were rendered asymptomatic, two were improved, and five were unchanged.
   Conclusions: The importance of venous sinus disease in the aetiology of IIH is probably underestimated. Lateral sinus stenting shows promise as an alternative treatment to neurosurgical intervention in intractable cases.

SO ACTA MEDICA PORTUGUESA
AB Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare but potentially severe condition in children. We present the case of a teenager with corticodependent nephrotic syndrome diagnosed at five months of age and treated with cyclosporine A. In the context of recurrence of nephrotic syndrome he presented with headache, vomiting and severe intracranial hypertension. While the raised intracranial pressure and the status epilepticus were controlled, the brain imaging revealed venous thrombosis of all venous sinus, with absence of venous drainage. He was submitted to local thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, with recanalization of the venous sinuses. The outcome was favourable, without neurological deficits. In this case, the early radiologic intervention was crucial, enabling a full neurological recovery, in a teenager whose initial prognosis was very poor.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A possible complication in the
   natural history of advanced prostate cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a variety of intracranial hypertension that is extremely rare in men. Obesity and hypogonadism are the most important predictive factors. Etiological hypotheses include increased central venous pressure, and various hormonal and metabolic changes commonly found in obese patients. We described the case of an obese man with prostate cancer who showed a consistent bodyweight increase during treatment with taxanes and prednisone. He was hospitalized because of a severe loss of vision as a consequence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A complete symptom remission was obtained after 3 weeks of anti-edema therapies (steroids, acetazolamide). Castration-resistant prostate cancer is a risk factor for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Long-term androgen deprivation therapy, bodyweight increase, and fluid retention during chronic steroid administration and taxane chemotherapy might favor the disease onset. This severe complication has a good outcome, and should be suspected in the presence of symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension.

TI Case report: atypical presentation of jugular foramen mass
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY
AB Introduction: Jugular foramen lesions are often associated with pathology of adjacent structures due to either compression or direct invasion. Common presenting symptoms include pulsatile tinnitus, a neck mass, hearing loss, and cranial nerve palsies, leading to changes in taste, vocal cord paralysis, dysphagia, and sternocleidomastoid/trapezius weakness (A. Hakuba, K. Hashi, K. Fujitani, et al., Jugular foramen neurinomas. Surg Neurol 1979; 11:83-94). This patient was found to have a jugular foramen mass after presenting with the unusual constellation of visual changes and headache.
   Case presentation: A jugular foramen mass in a young woman was discovered after presenting with visual changes and headache; the patient was found to have papilledema on initial examination. Otologic and head and neck examination were normal. Subsequent imaging demonstrated a mass at the right jugular foramen with compression of this structure; a contralateral transverse sinus stenosis was also seen. This latter abnormality (along with obstruction of the jugular foramen) impeded venous drainage leading to papilledema and visual changes.
   Discussion: In a patient presenting with papilledema and severe headache with an associated jugular foramen mass, a multidisciplinary approach benefits the patient with input from interventional neuroradiology, neurosurgery, and neuro-ophthalmology. Venous outflow was compromised through the left stenotic transverse sinus, and the normal outflow on the tight side through the jugular bulb was impeded by the tumor; obstructions of both led to symptomatic impeded venous outflow. This compromise in venous outflow led to an increase in superior sagittal sinus pressure, with subsequent increase in intracranial pressure and resultant papilledema. in an attempt to increase blood flow, an angioplasty was performed on the patient's affected transverse sinus. In addition, symptomatology consistent with pseudotumor cerebri prompted the use of acetazolamide for medical management. After both therapies, the patient's symptoms dramatically improved and were stable. The tumor has also remained stable, with no immediate need for surgical resection, stereotactic radiation, or consideration of an intraluminal transverse sinus stent placement or shunting.
   Conclusion: The unique presentation of a jugular foramen mass in a young woman leading to papilledema highlights the need for high clinical suspicion of potential etiologies necessary for diagnosis. Despite the benign nature of her disease process, an unusual constellation of anatomical factors lead to the need for acute intervention. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Wearable Sensing System for NonInvasive Monitoring of Intracranial
   BioFluid Shifts in Aerospace Applications
SO SENSORS
AB The alteration of the hydrostatic pressure gradient in the human body has been associated with changes in human physiology, including abnormal blood flow, syncope, and visual impairment. The focus of this study was to evaluate changes in the resonant frequency of a wearable electromagnetic resonant skin patch sensor during simulated physiological changes observed in aerospace applications. Simulated microgravity was induced in eight healthy human participants (n = 8), and the implementation of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) countermeasures was induced in four healthy human participants (n = 4). The average shift in resonant frequency was -13.76 +/- 6.49 MHz for simulated microgravity with a shift in intracranial pressure (ICP) of 9.53 +/- 1.32 mmHg, and a shift of 8.80 +/- 5.2097 MHz for LBNP with a shift in ICP of approximately -5.83 +/- 2.76 mmHg. The constructed regression model to explain the variance in shifts in ICP using the shifts in resonant frequency (R-2 = 0.97) resulted in a root mean square error of 1.24. This work demonstrates a strong correlation between sensor signal response and shifts in ICP. Furthermore, this study establishes a foundation for future work integrating wearable sensors with alert systems and countermeasure recommendations for pilots and astronauts.

   and discrete category of fluid tension disorders?
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB Open-angle glaucoma, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and Meniere's disease are disorders managed by different specialties in medicine viz. ophthalmology, neurology, and otorhinolaryngology respectively. By working in silos, the similarity of these disorders is overlooked. Close inspection of these disorders reveals the presence of signs and symptoms triggered by fluid under high pressure within relatively closed chambers. There is a similarity in the capillary production of fluid, which then circulates and drains into the venous system. Management practices that reduce fluid production, decrease fluid pressure or enhance fluid drainage are employed for the treatment of all three disorders. A search for a unifying mechanism explaining the pathophysiology of all three disorders may unlock effective and perhaps curative measures for these disorders.

TI The role of body position and gravity in the symptoms and treatment of
   various medical diseases
SO SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
AB Postural medicine studies the effects of gravity on human body functions and the ability to influence various diseases by changing the body's position. Orthostasis requires numerous cardiovascular and neurohumoral adaptations to prevent hypotension and a resulting decrease in cerebral perfusion. Sitting upright or in a semi-sitting position reduces venous return in patients with heart failure, intracranial pressure in patients with intracranial hypertension, intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients and may decrease gastro-oesophageal reflux. A left recumbent posture also decreases reflux. A right lateral position results in a lower sympathetic tone than lying on the left side and is beneficial in patients with heart failure or after an infarction without bradycardia. A 40 to 70% decreased prevalence of the sudden infant death syndrome has been observed since the recommendation to avoid laying infants to sleep in a prone position. Sleeping in a supine posture increases the severity of sleep apnoea compared to a lateral position. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a prone position can rapidly improve blood oxygenation. Idiopathic oedema, orthostatic proteinuria, intradiscal pressure and venous circulation in legs are improved in the decubitus position, whereas arterial flow is reduced. Health risks due to microgravity and prolonged bed rest, such as osteoporosis, venous thrombosis or pressure sores, are discussed.

SO EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY
CT 3rd Pangu Stroke Conference
CY OCT 10-12, 2014
CL Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB Cerebral vascular injury is a major component of acute brain injury. Currently, neuroprotective strategies primarily focus on the recanalization of cerebral arteries and capillaries, and the protection of insulted neurons. Hitherto, the role of vein drainage in the pathophysiology of acute brain injury has been overlooked, due to an under appreciation of the magnitude of the impact of veins in circulation. In this review, we summarize the changes in the vein morphology and functions that are known, or likely to occur related to acute brain injury, and aim to advance the therapeutic management of acute brain injury by shifting the focus from reperfusion to another term: recirculation. Recent progress in the neurobiological understanding of the vascular neural network has demonstrated that cerebral venous systems are able to respond to acute brain injury by regulating the blood flow disharmony following brain edema, blood brain barrier disruption, ischemia, and hemorrhage. With the evidence presented in this review, future clinical management of acutely brain injured patients will expand to include the recirculation concept, establishing a harmony between arterial and venous systems, in addition to the established recanalization and reperfusion strategies.

AB We report a case of benign intracranial hypertension in a 31-year-old man treated by endovascular stent placement in the right transverse sinus. The patient presented with a typical benign intracranial hypertension syndrome. Ophthalmologic findings showed bilateral papilledema with a 7/10 loss visual acuity loss in the right eye and 2/10 in the left eye. At lumbar puncture, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 40 mmHg. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed slit ventricles and dilatation of optic nerve sheaths. optiques. After failure of medical treatment, the patient was referred to our neurosurgical department for therapeutic decision. Direct retrograde cerebral venography showed predominant cerebral venous drainage via the right transverse sinus which exhibited stenosis in its proximal third. Mamometry revealed a 25 mmHg pressure gradient across the point of stenosis. Due to possible venogenic benign intracranial hypertension, endovascualr stent placement was proposed and accepted by the patient. At 3 months follow-up, the patient was symptoms free, papilledema had disappeared and visual acuity was 10/10 on both eyes. CSF pressure on lumbar puncture was 11 mmHg. The pathophysiological aspects and therapeutic management of this pathology illustrated by this are discussed along with a careful and exhaustive review of the literature.

CY MAR 31-APR 03, 2004
CL Snowbird, UT
AB Background. The objective of this study was to determine the intracranial, cardiovascular and respiratory changes induced by conversion to high-frequency oscillator ventilation from conventional mechanical ventilation at increasing airway pressures. Methods: In this study, 11 anaesthetized sheep had invasive cardiovascular and intracranial monitors placed. Lung injury was induced by saline lavage and head injury was induced by inflation of an intracranial balloon catheter. All animals were sequentially converted from conventional mechanical ventilation to high-frequency oscillator ventilation at target mean airway pressures of 16, 22, 28, 34 and 40 cm H2O. The mean airway pressure was achieved by adjusting positive end expiratory pressure while on conventional mechanical ventilation, and continuous distending pressures while on high-frequency oscillator ventilation. Cerebral lactate production, oxygen consumption and venous oximetry were measured and analysed in relation to changes in transcranial Doppler flow velocity. Transcranial Doppler profiles together with other physiological parameters were measured at each airway pressure. Results: Cerebral perfusion pressure was significantly lower during high-frequency oscillator ventilation than during conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV: 45, 34, 22, 6, 9 mmHg vs. HFOV: 33, 20, 19, 5, 5 mmHg at airway pressures mentioned above, P = 0.02). Intracranial pressure and cerebrovascular resistance increased with increasing intrathoracic pressures (P = 0.001). Cerebral metabolic indices demonstrated an initial increase in anaerobic metabolism followed by a decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption progressing to cerebral infarction as intrathoracic pressures were further increased in a stepwise fashion. Arterial PaCO2 increased significantly after converting from conventional mechanical ventilation to high-frequency oscillator ventilation (P = 0.001). However, no difference was observed between conventional mechanical ventilation and high-frequency oscillator ventilation when intracranial pressure, metabolic and transcranial Doppler indices were compared at equivalent mean airway pressures. Conclusions: The use of high positive end expiratory pressure with conventional mechanical ventilation or high continuous distending pressure with high-frequency oscillator ventilation increased intracranial pressure and adversely affected cerebral metabolic indices in this ovine model. Transcranial Doppler is a useful adjunct to Intracranial pressure and intracranial venous saturation monitoring when major changes in ventilation strategy are adopted.

TI Critical Care Ultrasonography
SO EMERGENCY MEDICINE CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB Resuscitative ultrasonography provides rapid, repeatable, and multisystem assessment to guide diagnosis and management of critically ill patients in the emergency department (ED). Cardiac ultrasonography offers new anatomic and hemodynamic information, previously unavailable in an ED setting, whereas other applications match or exceed the speed and utility of existing tests such as chest radiograph (thoracic ultrasonography) or central venous pressure determination (inferior vena cava ultrasonography). Evolving areas of resuscitative ultrasonography include neurologic applications and transesophageal echocardiography, which promise to further enhance the role of ultrasonography in managing critical illness in the ED.

TI Intravascular ultrasound characteristics of different types of stenosis
   in idiopathic intracranial hypertension with venous sinus stenosis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB BackgroundIn this study, we analyzed the characteristics of different stenosis types in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients with venous sinus stenosis (VSS) using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data from patients who underwent IVUS evaluation during venography or stenting procedures between January 2014 and February 2022. ResultsAmong the 80 patients with intrinsic lesions, 47 cases were identified, including 41 single lesions and 6 multiple lesions. Single lesions consisted of 36 cases of AG, 3 cases of brain herniation, and 2 cases of septation. Multiple intrinsic lesions were found in 6 patients, with AG observed in the transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus. IVUS features varied depending on the anatomical variations of intrinsic stenosis. Additionally, among the 33 cases of extrinsic stenosis, two types were observed: unilateral compression (22 cases) and bilateral compression (11 cases), primarily affecting the transverse sinus. ConclusionIVUS effectively differentiated intrinsic and extrinsic types of stenosis and identified intraluminal and mural components of intrinsic stenosis.

TI Ophthalmodynamometric measurement of central retinal vein pressure as
   surrogate of intracranial pressure in idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension
SO GRAEFES ARCHIVE FOR CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Background Since a direct non-invasive measurement of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is not available, it was the purpose of the study to describe the non-invasive determination of the central retinal vein pressure as an estimate of an elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure.
   Methods A 28-year-old female patient with blurred vision, nuchal pain and prominent optic discs underwent modified ophthalmodynamometry to determine the central retinal vein pressure as surrogate of the intracranial pressure. A Goldmann contact lens with a pressure sensor mounted into its holding ring was placed onto the cornea. Pressure was applied to the globe by slightly pressing the contact lens until the central retinal vein started to pulsate/collapse.
   Results Despite an abnormally high central retinal vein pressure (OD: 17 arbitrary units; OS: 33 arbitrary units), the neurological examination including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was unremarkable on the first day. A lumbar puncture revealed a cerebrospinal fluid pressure of 25 cm H(2)O, which was at the upper limit of the normal range. Over the next 2 days, ophthalmodynamometry showed increasing measurements of the central retinal vein pressure for both eyes, parallel to elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurements by lumbar puncture, leading to the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. After treatment, the cerebrospinal fluid pressure returned to normal levels, parallel to a decrease in the central retinal vein pressure as determined by ophthalmodynamometry.
   Conclusions Ophthalmodynamometry of the central retinal vein was helpful in the diagnosis of an elevated intracranial pressure, with direct lumbar pressure measurement running parallel to the ophthalmodynamometric measurements.

TI THE EFFECTS OF ATRACURIUM BESYLATE (TRACRIUM) ON INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE
   AND CEREBRAL PERFUSION-PRESSURE
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB Twenty-five patients with expansive pathologic brain lesions, who were anesthetized with thiopental, nitrous oxide in oxygen, and fentanyl, and who were mechanically ventilated to ensure normocarbia, received atracurium besylate 0.6 mg/kg, intravenously. Intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, central venous presure, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 were simultaneously recorded for 5 min before and for 10 min after administraton of the muscle relaxant. No statistically significant changes were observed after administration of atracurium besylate. These results suggest that atracurium besylate may be used for muscle relaxation during neurosurgical operations, despite its potential for histamine release and excitement of the central nervous system.

TI Validation of a mathematical model for understanding intracranial
   pressure curve morphology
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING
AB The physiology underlying the intracranial pressure (ICP) curve morphology is not fully understood. Recent research has suggested that the morphology could be dependent on arterial cerebral inflow and the physiological and pathophysiological properties of the intracranial cavity. If understood, the ICP curve could provide information about the patient's cerebrovascular state important in individualizing treatment in neuro intensive care patients. A mathematical model based on known physiological properties of the intracranial compartment was created. Clinical measurements from ten neuro intensive care patients in whom intracranial arterial blood inflow, venous blood outflow and cerebrospinal fluid flow over the foramen magnum had been measured with phase contrast MRI, concomitant with ICP measurements were used to validate the model. In nine patients the mathematical model was able to create an ICP curve mimicking the measured by using arterial intracranial inflow and adjusting physiological parameters of the model. The venous outflow and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow over the foramen magnum predicted by the model were within physiologically reasonable limits and in most cases followed the MRI measured values in close adjunct. The presented model could produce an ICP curve in close resemblance of the in vivo measured curves. This strengthens the hypothesis that the ICP curve is shaped by the arterial intracranial inflow and the physiological properties of the intracranial cavity.

TI Abdominal compartment syndrome: an underdiagnosed contributory factor to
   morbidity and mortality in the critically ill
SO POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB As the abdomen is a closed cavity, it follows that any increase in abdominal contents will inexorably lead to a rise in the intra-abdominal pressure. Normally this is less than 7 mm Hg, but when it persistently exceeds 12 mm Hg, renal, intestinal, pulmonary, cardiovascular and central nervous system dysfunction arises. A wide range of conditions encountered in both medical and surgical intensive care units are associated with a rise in intra-abdominal pressure. When this pressure is continually above 20 mm Hg, organ system failure can occur, a condition known as abdominal compartment syndrome. Failure to recognise and treat this syndrome is associated with a high morbidity and mortality.

TI Intracranial Fluid Dynamics Changes in Idiopathic Intracranial
   Hypertension: Pre and Post Therapy
SO CURRENT NEUROVASCULAR RESEARCH
AB Objective: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology frequently associated with dural sinus stenosis. There is emerging evidence that venous sinus stenting is an effective treatment. We use phase contrast cine MRI to observe changes in flow dynamics of multiple intracranial fluids and their response to different treatments in a patient with IIH.
   Methods: We quantified the following parameters at the level of the aqueduct of Sylvius and the cervical C2C3: Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), arterial and venous flow; CSF velocity amplitude; artero-venous delay (AVD); artero-CSF delay and percentage of venous outflow normalized to total arterial inflow (tIJV/tA). Analyses were run before Lumbar Puncture (LP) (A), after LP (B), after medical therapy (C) and after venous stent placements deployed at two separate times (D and E).
   Results: AVD and tIJV/tA improved only after CSF removal and after stent placements. CSF velocity amplitude remained elevated. Arterial flow profile showed a dramatic reduction after LP with improvement in mean venous flow. This report is the first to demonstrate interactive changes in intracranial fluid dynamics that occur before and after different therapeutic interventions in IIH.
   Conclusion: The data provide valuable information regarding changes in different fluid compartments suggesting a profound redistribution of pressures along fluid compartments after different treatments. We discuss how increased intracranial venous blood could be "tumoral" in IIH and facilitating its outflow could be therapeutic.

TI How to treat dural arteriovenous malformations or fistulas
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN NEUROSURGERY
AB The clinical symptoms of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) depend mainly on the site and venous drainage pattern of the lesion. The goal of treatment of the lesion is the permanent and complete elimination of the arteriovenous shunt. Transarterial embolization or stereotactic radiation may affect feeding arteries or nidus. The involved sinus can be obliterated by percutaneous pr surgical transvenous embolization, or resected by surgery. In cases of patients with pure leptomeningeal drainage, surgical interruption of leptomeningeal drainage may be effective. Based on the experiences reported in the literature, transarterial embolization of accessible feeding arteries is the initial treatment to decrease arterial blood flow. Transvenous embolization may be effective depending on the venous drainage pattern. For the AVFs remaining after transarterial embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery is recommended if feasible. Transvenous embolization may be applied cautiously considering the risk of venous hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage. Direct microsurgery is indicated if stereotactic radiosurgery is not performed safely. For cases without dural sinus drainage, surgical interruption of leptomeningeal drainage may be applied safely. The decision to intervene in dural AVFs is based on the following factors: age and general condition of the patient, severity of the presenting symptoms, natural history of the lesion if left untreated, angiographic features on the location of dural AVFs and the venous drainage pattern, and morbidity and mortality of the procedure being considered.

TI Depressed skull fracture overlying the superior sagittal sinus causing
   benign intracranial hypertension. Description of two cases and review of
   the literature
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB The purpose of this report is to describe successful surgical treatment of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) in two patients presenting with depressed skull fractures over the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). The first case involved a 22-year-old patient who presented with depressed skull fracture overlying the posterior third of the SSS. Symptoms of BIH developed within 48 h. The second case involved a 33-year-old patient who presented with depressed skull fracture overlying the junction between the middle and posterior thirds of the SSS. Symptoms of BIH developed 1 month after. Although this patient presented with bilateral papilloedema, the less straightforward nature of his BIH symptoms prompted us to undertake further neuroradiological assessment by angiography with retrograde venous catheterization. A high-pressure gradient was found between venous flow upstream and downstream from the compressed zone. Both patients underwent surgical decompression in the lateral decubital position. Continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure was begun upon induction of general anaesthesia. High preoperative pressure declined immediately after elevation of the depressed zone. Bleeding was not a problem at any time during the procedure. Follow-up MRI and angio-MRI demonstrated total restoration of SSS patency. Benign intracranial hypertension is an uncommon complication of depressed skull fracture. Retrograde venous catheterization with pressure measurement can be a useful diagnostic adjunct. Surgical treatment is indicated in symptomatic patients. Based on the two cases reported, we now propose MRI venography in all patients presenting with symptoms of BIH and arteriography with retrograde venous catheterization when venous sinus stenosis exists.

TI Observational study of intracranial pressure instability in patients
   with pseudotumour cerebri syndrome
SO BRAIN AND SPINE
AB Introduction: A fixed CSF pressure (CSFp) of 25 cmH2O (18 mmHg) has been utilised to date to define and classify pseudotumour cerebri syndrome (PTCS). Furthermore, ICP monitoring, and CSF infusion tests have not been frequently performed in this group of patients. Research question: We aimed to report typical, unusual and unstable patterns of ICP in patients with PTCS. Material and methods: We reviewed the recordings of CSF infusion tests and overnight ICP monitoring of patients with suspected or confirmed IIH between January 2003-December 2020.We excluded all patients with a shunt in situ and selected recordings that represented unstable patterns of ICP changes in PTCS. Results: 463 CSF infusion tests and 26 ICP monitorings of PTCS patients had been performed in this timeframe. We divided results of observed pattern into two group: those with known venous sinus measurements (Group A) and those without (Group B). Observed recordings formed a total of 5 and 4 different patterns respectively, based on the behaviour of ICP and slow waves at rest, overnight, and during infusion as well as in relationship to the clinical presentation of each patient. Discussion and conclusion: Accurate monitoring of ICP in PTCS is quintessential. Full understanding of each element of its pathophysiology and their interaction would be essential and include quantification of the CSF pressure not only as a number, but also with consideration of its dynamic contents. Cerebral venous pressure measurements and/or monitoring may be useful. Consideration of the presence or absence of papilloedema in the context of disturbed CSF dynamics could reveal further diagnostic and therapeutic insights.

TI Neurological sequelae from brachiocephalic vein stenosis Report of 2
   cases
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Stenosis of central veins (brachiocephalic vein [BCV] and superior vena cava) occurs in 30% of hemodialysis patients, rarely producing intracranial pathology. The authors present the first cases of BCV stenosis causing perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage and myoclonic epilepsy.
   In the first case, a 73-year-old man on hemodialysis presented with headache and blurry vision, and was admitted with presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension after negative CT studies and confirmatory lumbar puncture. The patient mildly improved until hospital Day 3, when he experienced a seizure; emergency CT scans showed perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography failed to find any vascular abnormality, but demonstrated venous congestion. A fistulogram found left BCV occlusion with jugular reflux. The occlusion could not be reopened percutaneously and required open fistula ligation. Postoperatively, symptoms resolved and the patient remained intact at 7-month follow-up.
   In the second case, a 67-year-old woman on hemodialysis presented with right arm weakness and myoclonic jerks. Admission MRI revealed subcortical edema and a possible dural arteriovenous fistula. Cerebral angiography showed venous engorgement, but no vascular malformation. A fistulogram found left BCV stenosis with jugular reflux, which was immediately reversed with angioplasty and stent placement. Postprocedure the patient was seizure free, and her strength improved. Seven months later the patient presented in myoclonic status epilepticus, and a fistulogram revealed stent occlusion. Angioplasty successfully reopened the stent and she returned to baseline; she was seizure free at 4-month follow-up.
   Central venous stenosis is common with hemodialysis, but rarely presents with neurological findings. Prompt recognition and endovascular intervention can restore normal venous drainage and resolve symptoms. (http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2013.1.JNS121529)

TI Venous Sinus Stenosis Treatment in Pediatric Idiopathic Intracranial
   Hypertension: Illustrative Case and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB -OBJECTIVE: To review the literature of venous sinus stenosis (VSS) treatment in children for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and present our own institutional case.
   -METHODS: A literature review was conducted using the PubMed and MED-LINE databases up to June 2020. From 134 studies that were screened, 6 studies were chosen for analysis that included patients <18 years old, a diagnosis of IIH that fit Dandy diagnostic criteria, and angiogram obtained to assess for VSS. IIH symptoms experienced in the pediatric population and efficacy of venous sinus stenting were analyzed.
   -RESULTS: Eleven patients identified in the literature and 1 patient from our institution were included in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in pressure gradient response to stenting between male and female patients (P = 0.424) or patients with body mass index >90th percentile (P = 0.626). Larger decreases in pressure gradient after stent placement correlated with headache resolution (P = 0.0005). Patients who underwent unilateral stenting showed greater reduction in pressure gradient compared with patients who underwent bilateral stenting (average change 24 mm Hg vs. 5.75 mm Hg, P = 0.003).
   -CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that VSS treatment has the potential to be a safe option for IIH in pediatric patients. VSS treatment has shown similar results to traditional cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures, with a lower complication rate and need for revision. More studies should be conducted to analyze the long-term efficacy and safety of VSS treatment in pediatric patients with IIH.

AB Hydrocephalus patients with increased intracranial pressure are generally treated by draining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the abdomen through an implanted shunt with a passive differential pressure valve. To perfectly adapt the valve's opening pressure to the patient's need, more information on the acutal pressure across the valve in everyday life actions like walking, eating, sleeping etc. is necessary.
   Therefore, intracranial pressure (ICP), intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the hydrostatic pressure between both ends of the the fictitious shunt have been measured simultaneously for up to 24 hours in home environment at different body postures. The patient was wearing the new telemetric ICP probe Neurovent-P-tel as implant. The pressure sensor Omnibar E5F measured IAP in the rectum (10 cm deep).
   In this pilot study, IAP increased 20 mmHg more than ICP during coughing and 35 mmHg more during sneezing. As the pressure difference across the fictitious valve became negative in some postures, CSF drainage would not have been possible. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper that presents measurements, which provide insight into the differential pressure across a hydrocephalus valve in everyday life and give information for future electromechanic shunts development.

TI Stenting for Venous Sinus Stenosis in Patients With Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension: An Updated Systematic Review and
   Meta-Analysis of the Literature
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Although venous sinus stenting (VSS) improves cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption and decreases intracranial pressure in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), the underlying pathophysiology of IIH is not well understood. We present a review and meta-analysis of the literature on VSS for IIH treatment, focusing on the rates of restenosis and symptom recurrence. METHODS:We performed a systematic review of PubMed and Embase databases between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2021. Articles including >= 5 patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis treated with VSS and post-treatment rates of restenosis (de novo stenosis at a different anatomic location along the dural sinuses or restenosis within or adjacent to the stent) were selected. Demographic, procedural, and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. Mean values for variables collected were pooled, and a mean value was calculated with a 95% CI. RESULTS:Twenty-four articles were included, comprising 694 patients and 781 VSS cases. The mean age was 33.9 (CI, 31.5-36.2) years. The mean body mass index was 35.3 (CI, 32.9-37.7) kg/m2. Before VSS, 98.8% (CI, 96.8%-100.0%) of patients experienced headaches, 87.7% (CI, 80.6%-95.5%) had visual acuity issues, 78.7% (CI, 69.9%-88.5%) had papilledema, 58.3% (CI, 46.0%-73.9%) had tinnitus, and 98.8% (96.4%-100.0%) had symptoms refractory to previous therapies. After VSS, 77.7% (CI, 71.1%-84.95%) experienced symptom improvement and 22.3% (CI, 15.1%-29.0%) had persistent or worsened symptoms. Pooled restenosis rate was 17.7% (CI, 14.9%-20.9%). CONCLUSION:VSS is effective in alleviating IIH signs and symptoms, but the associated high rates of restenosis and persistent symptoms highlight the need for further investigation of this procedure and other adjunctive treatments for IIH.

TI Association between intra-abdominal pressure and jugular bulb saturation
   in critically ill patients
SO MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
AB Background. Disorders in cerebral circulation following elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) may lead to silent brain ischemia, which can be serious problem in sedated critically ill patients. The aim of the present study was to analyse the possible association between jugular venous bulb pressure (jVBP) and jugular venous bulb saturation (SjO(2)) to IAP in critically ill patients.
   Methods. Adult septic shock patients with acute kidney injury were studied just after the admission to Intensive Care Unit and after 24 and 48 hours of treatment. Patients were divided into: CVVH group (patients treated with continuous veno-venous haemofiltration) and furosemide group (patients treated with furosemide infusion). The IAP was measured via the bladder. The right jugular vein was retrogradely cannulated for JVBP and SjO(2) measurement. Intra-abdominal hypertension was defined as a sustained increase of IAP equal to or above 12 mmHg.
   Results. Forty patients (25 male and 15 female patients) were studied. In all participants, IAP strongly correlated with JVBP (P<0.001, r=0.73). This correlation was stronger in the furosemide group than the CVVH group. Moreover, an increase in IAP was related to an increase in JVBP and a decrease in SjO(2). There was an inverse correlation between LAP and SjO(2) (P<0.001, r=-0.55). This correlation was stronger in furosemide group than CVVH group.
   Conclusion. IAP is correlated to JVBP and inversely correlated to SjO(2). Increase in LAP leads to elevation in JVBP and decrease in SjO(2). Renal replacement therapy disturbs the correlation between TAP, JVBP and SjO(2).

TI Diagnosis and Management of Cerebral Venous Diseases in
   Neuro-Ophthalmology: Ongoing Controversies
SO ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Diseases of the cerebral venous system frequently lead to neuro-ophthalmic complications. Cortical venous sinus thrombosis and dural arteriovenous fistulas may be complicated by elevation of intracranial pressure, with secondary papilledema or abducens palsies. There is increasing recognition that stenosis at the transverse sinus-sigmoid sinus junction plays a role in the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and offers a new avenue of treatment in patients who fail medical therapy. Diseases of the cavernous sinus manifest with their own set of neuro-ophthalmic symptoms, reflecting the presence of all 3 ocular motor nerves and the oculosympathetic fibers within its walls, along with its role as the primary drainage pool of the globe and orbit. Numerous questions and controversies remain regarding the diagnosis and optimal treatment of cerebral venous disease, including the role of venous stenting in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, the role of anticoagulation in cavernous sinus thrombosis, and the risks and benefits of embolization of mild indirect cavernous carotid fistulas.

TI Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas: A Review of the Literature and a
   Presentation of a Single Institution's Experience
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are arteriovenous shunts from a dural arterial supply to a dural venous channel, typically supplied by pachymeningeal arteries and located near a major venous sinus. A retrospective review was conducted to present the results of endovascular obliteration of DAVFs, with particular emphasis of newer liquid embolic agents, including Onyx-18 (MV3, Irvine, California, USA).
   METHODS: A review of the literature was performed, and a presentation of the number of treatments, complications, and outcomes is included here. The number of arterial embolizations and need for transvenous embolization, open surgery, and radiosurgery was assessed as well as normalization of retrograde cortical venous drainage.
   RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (22 men and 17 women) underwent endovascular treatment of DAVFs at our institution from 2001 to 2009. Ages ranged from 39 to 71 years (mean, 48 years). Seventy-nine percent of patients had retrograde cortical venous drainage. The average number of embolizations in all patients was 2.1. Twelve patients underwent 40 embolization treatments with Onyx, with an obliteration rate of 75% and cortical venous drainage obliteration rate of 85%. Seventy-one percent (28/39) of patients had complete treatment of the fistula: 21 by purely endovascular treatment and 7 with endovascular therapy followed by craniotomy, as well as seven patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery after embolization.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular management of DAVFs is a safe and effective method of treating these complex lesions.

TI Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamic changes in patients with
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension using phase contrast cine MR
   imaging
SO EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY PSYCHIATRY AND NEUROSURGERY
AB Background Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) mainly affects overweight women in the middle age period. The pathophysiology of IIH stays unclear, but suggested mechanisms include excess CSF production, reduced CSF absorption, increased brain water content, and increased cerebral venous pressure Objectives To assess the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamic changes in aqueduct of Sylvius in patients of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with new MRI technique: phase contrast cine MRI (PCC-MRI). Methods Thirty patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension were divided into 3 groups according to treatment options (no treatment, medical treatment, and medical treatment with repeated lumbar tapping). CSF flow data were evaluated by phase contrast cine MRI. Results PCC-MRI parameters were significantly higher in group who was on medical treatment (group II) than other groups. The sensitivity of PCC MRI parameters ranged from 56.7 (stroke volume (SV) and mean flow (MF)) to 83.3% (peak systolic velocity (PSV)). A statistically significant difference was found for the mean flow value (p0.039) between the control group and IIH patients. Conclusion The most specific CSF flowmetry parameter detected to help diagnosis of IIH is mean flow especially among early discovered patients. PCC MRI can be used as non-invasive technique for diagnosis of IIH and treatment follow-up.

TI Noninvasive intracranial pressure real-time waveform analysis monitor
   during prostatectomy robotic surgery and Trendelenburg position: case
   report
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Both robotic surgery and head-down tilt increase intracranial pressure by impairing venous blood outflow. Prostatectomy is commonly performed in elderly patients, who are more likely to develop postoperative cognitive disorders. Therefore, increased intracranial pressure could play an essential role in cognitive decline after surgery. We describe a case of a 69 year-old male who underwent a robotic prostatectomy. Noninvasive Brain4careTM intraoperative monitoring showed normal intracranial compliance during anesthesia induction, but it rapidly decreased after head-down tilt despite normal vital signs, low lung pressure, and adequate anesthesia depth. We conclude that there is a need for intraoperative intracranial compliance monitoring since there are major changes in cerebral compliance during surgery, which could potentially allow early identification and treatment of impaired cerebral complacency.

TI Intrathoracic pressure regulator during continuous-chest-compression
   advanced cardiac resuscitation improves vital organ perfusion pressures
   in a porcine model of cardiac arrest
SO CIRCULATION
AB Background - A novel device, the intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR), combines an inspiratory impedance threshold device (ITD) with a vacuum source for the generation of controlled - 10 mm Hg vacuum in the trachea during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while allowing positive pressure ventilation. Compared with standard ( STD) CPR, ITPR-CPR will enhance venous return, systemic arterial pressure, and vital organ perfusion in both porcine models of ventricular fibrillation and hypovolemic cardiac arrest.
   Methods and Results - In protocol 1, 20 pigs ( weight, 30 +/- 0.5 kg) were randomized to STD-CPR or ITPR-CPR. After 8 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation, CPR was performed for 6 minutes at 100 compressions per minute and positive pressure ventilation ( 100% O-2) with a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 15:2. In protocol 2, 6 animals were bled 50% of their blood volume. After 4 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation, interventions were performed for 2 minutes with STD-CPR and 2 minutes of ITPR-CPR. This sequence was repeated. In protocol 3, 6 animals after 8 minutes of untreated VF were treated with ITPR-CPR for 15 minutes, and arterial and venous blood gases were collected at baseline and minutes 5, 10, and 15 of CPR. A newer, leak-proof ITPR device was used. Aortic, right atrial, endotracheal pressure, intracranial pressure, and end-tidal CO2 values were measured ( mm Hg); common carotid arterial flow also was measured (mL/min). Coronary perfusion pressure (diastolic; aortic minus right atrial pressure) and cerebral perfusion pressure ( mean arterial minus mean intracranial pressure) were calculated. Unpaired Student t test and Friedman's repeated-measures ANOVA of ranks were used in protocols 1 and 3. A 2-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for analysis in protocol 2. Fischer's exact test was used for survival. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Vital organ perfusion pressures and end-tidal CO2 were significantly improved with ITPR-CPR in both protocols. In protocol 1, 1-hour survival was 100% with ITPR-CPR and 10% with STD-CPR ( P = 0.001). Arterial blood pH was significantly lower and PaCO2 was significantly higher with ITPR-CPR in protocol 1. Arterial oxygen saturation was 100% throughout the study in both protocols. PaCO2 and PaO2 remained stable, but metabolic acidosis progressed, as expected, throughout the 15 minutes of CPR in protocol 3.
   Conclusions - Compared with STD-CPR, use of ITPR-CPR improved hemodynamics and short-term survival rates after cardiac arrest.

TI Intracranial hypertension secondary to unruptured pial arteriovenous
   malformation. Suitability of isolated endovascular treatment with
   ethylene vinyl alcohol / dimethyl sulfoxide (Onyx®). Case report and
   literature review
SO NEUROCIRUGIA
AB A 36-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with clinical symptoms of blurred vision of progressive onset of two years of evolution. The ophthalmological examination revealed the existence of bilateral papilledema. Using cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the presence of a right occipital pial arteriovenous malformation was certified. Arteriographically, pial arterial contributions dependent on the right middle cerebral artery and the right posterior cerebral artery were identified. Venous drainage was located at the level of the superior sagittal sinus. An associated right transverse sinus stenosis was also identified. The existence of secondary intracranial hypertension was corroborated by monitoring with an intracranial pressure sensor. An interventional procedure was carried out consisting of embolization of the arterial supplies of the lesion using Onyx (R). The clinical-radiological findings after the procedure were favorable: the papilledema disappeared and complete exclusion of the malformation was achieved. A new intracranial pressure measurement showed resolution of intracranial hypertension. Subsequent regulated radiological controls showed complete exclusion of the malformation up to 5 years later.

TI A mathematical model of idiopathic intracranial hypertension
   incorporating increased arterial inflow and variable venous outflow
   collapsibility Clinical article
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Object. A collapsible segment in the venous outflow has been noted in many patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Mathematical modeling has shown that these collapsible segments can account for the elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures associated with IIH. However, the model required an elevated outflow resistance of up to 10 times normal to predict the CSF pressures actually found clinically. Measurement of blood flow in patients with IIH has shown that inflow rates vary, with higher rates noted in patients with lesser outflow stenoses. The aim of this work was to extend a simple model of cerebral hydrodynamics to accommodate a collapsible sinus and elevations in cerebral blood flow in accordance with in vivo measurements.
   Methods. Forty patients with IIH underwent MR imaging in which the degree of stenosis on MR venography was compared with the total blood inflow by using MR flow quantification. The relative outflow resistance in IIH was estimated using the CSF opening pressure. The patients were compared with 14 age-matched control individuals.
   Results. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on MR venography appearances (minimal stenosis, stenosis of 40-70% and > 70% stenosis). In vivo measurements suggested a relative resistance elevation of 2.5 times normal, 4.2 times normal, and 4.8 times normal in the 3 groups, respectively. There was an increased inflow of 1.56 times normal, 1.28 times normal, and 1.19 times normal in these groups.
   Conclusions. The model correctly predicted the CSF pressures noted in vivo, suggesting that high arterial inflow is required for patients with low-grade stenoses to be symptomatic. (DOI: 10.3171/2008.6.17609)

TI Shunt freedom and clinical resolution of idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension after bariatric surgery in the pediatric population: report
   of 3 cases
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), formerly known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a disease of elevated intracranial pressure that is thought to develop due to impaired CSF absorption related to elevated venous sinus pressure in the setting of increased intraabdominal and thoracic pressures. Symptoms can be disabling and, if left untreated, can lead to permanent visual loss. Previous treatments directed toward vision preservation include CSF diversion through shunting and optic nerve sheath fenestration. Recently, attention has been turned toward surgical weight loss strategies as an alternative to shunt treatment. The authors present a report of 3 patients with adolescent-onset IIH that was treated at the authors' institution (Duke University) in whom bariatric surgery was pursued successfully. The patients had previously undergone CSF shunting at ages 12, 15, and 23 years. They were shunt dependent for a collective average of 3.3 years prior to bariatriwc surgery. All patients reported "low-pressure" or postural headaches after bariatric surgery that correlated with dramatic reduction in their weight. Two of the 3 patients had their shunts removed and continued to be shunt free 1.5 years later at last follow-up; the third patient remained shunt dependent with the pressure set at 200 mm H2O. Given the significant complications inherent to multiple shunt revisions, earlier intervention for weight loss, including bariatric surgery, in these patients might have prevented complications and the associated health care burden. The authors recommend a multidisciplinary approach for IIH treatment with early consideration for weight loss interventions in select patients.

TI The Increase of Intra-Abdominal Pressure Can Affect Intraocular Pressure
SO BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB Objective. This study aims to explore the usage of intraocular pressure measurements as the early indicator of the increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Methods. In this prospective study, 40 patients undergoing elective surgery were included. Patients were divided into four groups of 10 patients. The control group (Group C) was not subjected to laparoscopic intervention. Laparoscopic surgery was, respectively, performed with an intra-abdominal pressure of 9, 12, and 15 mmHg in Groups L (low), M (medium), and H (high pressure). Intraocular pressure was measured binocularly in each patient at three different times (before, during, and end of surgery) using a contact tonometer. Results. Patients' gender, age, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class, and operative times were not different among the groups. No complications occurred with either the surgery or measurement of intraocular pressure. Intubation was associated with a severe rise in IOP (P < 0.05). An increase in intraocular pressure was seen in groups M and H (P < 0.05). Conclusion. Intraocular pressure was increased in the groups with an intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg or more. Measuring the intraocular pressure might be a useful method to estimate the intra-abdominal pressure.

TI FALLING INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE - AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE GENESIS OF
   INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE IN THE BEAGLE PUPPY
SO BIOLOGY OF THE NEONATE
AB To study the role of extravascular intracranial pressure (ICP) in the genesis of intracranial hemorrhage in the beagle puppy, we measured ICP in animals on the day of birth, untreated 3-day-old controls, and 3-day-old animals treated from birth with prolactin. Baseline ICP varied substantially in all 3 groups. Only 8 % of this variability was attributable to variability in mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure. ICP was lower in the 3-day-old controls, animals at high risk for intracranial hemorrhage after a hypovolemic/hypotensive insult followed by rapid volume expansion, than in the other groups which are at lower risk. Administration of a hyperosmolar insult, intraperitoneal glycerol, to animals whose ICP was relatively high promptly lowered ICP. After this treatment, the risk of intracranial hemorrhage was markedly increased in these previously low-risk groups. We conclude that the normal neonatal decrease in brain water content and the consequent fall in ICP substantially increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in the beagle puppy, a model which appears similar in pathophysiology to hemorrhage in the pre-term human infant.

In patients with cerebral arterial stenosis (CAS), the symptoms caused by CVSS are often mistakenly thought of being attributed to CAS. In this case, we aimed to highlight the clinical manifestations and treatment strategies of CVSS comorbid with CAS. Materials and methods:We present an 83-year-old female who complained a series of nonspecific and non-focal neurological deficits such as tinnitus, head noise, dizziness, etc. She was initially diagnosed as CAS and underwent anti-CAS medication orally for over 2 years, whereas her symptoms were still aggravating. Results:Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed severe stenoses at bilateral sigmoid-transverse sinus conjunctions, and thus, the patient underwent intravenous stenting finally. Her aforementioned symptoms significantly attenuated after venous stenting and even disappeared gradually at 3-month, 6-month and 1-year follow-up. Conclusions:This paper revealed that cerebral venous outflow disturbance should not be overlooked when the nonspecific and non-focal neurological deficits could not be explained by cerebral artery disease. For this arteriovenous condition, intravenous stenting may be a feasible and effective way for symptoms relieving.

TI Exploring The Current Management Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension,
   And Understanding The Role Of Dural Venous Sinus Stenting
SO EYE AND BRAIN
AB Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a debilitating disorder characterised by raised intracranial pressure (ICP), papilloedema with the potential risk of permanent visual loss, and headaches that are profoundly disabling and reduce the quality of life. The first consensus guidelines have been published on investigation and management of adult IIH and one key area of uncertainty is the utility of dural venous sinus stenting for the management of headache and visual loss. There are an increasing number of series published and to help understand the successes and complications. During a patient physician priority setting, the understanding of the best type of intervention to treat IIH was assigned to the top 10 of most desired research questions for the disease. Ultimately randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in neurovascular stenting for IIH would be instructive, as the literature to date may suffer from publication bias. Due to the increasing incidence of IIH, there is no better time to systematically investigate interventions that may reverse the disease process and achieve remission. In this review we discuss the pathophysiology of IIH in relation to venous sinus stenosis, the role of venous sinus stenting with a review of the relevant literature, the advantages and disadvantages of stenting compared with other surgical interventions, and the future of stenting in the treatment of IIH.

TI COMPUTERIZED MONITORING-SYSTEM IN NEUROSURGICAL INTENSIVE-CARE
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB A computerized monitoring and analyzing system for neurosurgical intensive care has been developed. The system continuously monitors the function of the central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory system. Correlation between such parameters can be analyzed automatically. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were monitored as parameters for CNS function and condition. The cardiovascular and respiratory systems were monitored by heart rate, systemic blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, respiratory rate, and expiratory O2 and CO2 pressures. Body temperature was also monitored continuously. Sequential changes of those parameters were displayed on time-dependent trend graphs, and correlations between each parameter were automatically analyzed by linear regression equations. The clinical applicability of the system was demonstrated in the postoperative treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured intracranial aneurysm. In such a case, EEG slowing was observed in this system prior to clinical deterioration, and had a correlation with a decrease of pulmonary arterial pressure. Thus, the necessity for restoration of intravascular volume was realized before clinical deterioration progressed.

TI The abdominal compartment syndrome following aortic surgery
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB Background: multi-organ failure is a leading cause of death following aneurysm surgery, especially in the emergency setting. Intra-abdominal hypertension is an important factor in the development of multi-organ failure. Prevention, early recognition and prompt treatment of abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome may reduce mortality following aneurysm surgery.
   Methods: a descriptive review of the literature from a Medline search.
   Results and Conclusions: the abdominal compartment syndrome is the result of diverse physiological effects caused by increased intra-abdominal pressure. The syndrome has been most widely described in trauma victims, but occurs in patients following aortic surgery, particularly following ruptured aneurysm repair. Preventative therapy should be instituted to minimise its development in patients at risk, and monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure may allow prompt treatment Of this condition.

TI Multisystem organ failure secondary to increased intraabdominal pressure
SO INFECTION
AB Acutely increased intraabdominal pressure can lead to multisystem organ dysfunction. Organ dysfunction consists of acute pulmonary failure secondary to compressive atelectasis and associated with high peak inspiratory pressures and impaired gas exchange, acute renal failure with marked oliguria without hypernaturia, intestinal and hepatic ischemia possibly leading to bacterial translocation or necrosis with peritonitis, increased intracranial pressures which may cause brain dysfunction or aggravate head injury edema, venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, and abdominal wall ischemia or necrosis. The diagnosis is made clinically in a patient,vith high peak inspiratory pressures, oliguria and an apparently tight abdomen, although urinary bladder pressure greater than or equal to 20 cm H2O pressure is suggestive. However, chronically increased intraabdominal pressure as is seen in the morbidly obese, pregnancy and cirrhosis may be misleading. As to treatment, once the diagnosis is made, the patient's abdomen should be opened and the tension relieved. The intestinal contents need to be protected and evaporative water loss minimized by either closing the skin and not the fascia or, if this is not possible, using an impermeable protective dressing. If the abdomen is difficult to close at the primary operation, it is best to prevent the development of an acute abdominal compartment syndrome by closing only the skin or leaving it open and using an impermeable dressing. In conclusion, the acute abdominal compartment syndrome has become increasingly recognized as a cause for multisystem organ failure. Recognition of the problem or prevention is mandatory for optimal patient survival.

TI Evolutionary History of Multiple Dural Fistula
SO JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE MEDICINE HIGH IMPACT CASE REPORTS
AB Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are abnormal communications between arteries and veins or dural venous sinuses, which sit between the sheets of the dura. They represent 10% to 15% of intracranial vascular malformations. Clinical manifestations and prognosis depend on the pattern of venous drainage and location. The clinical presentation of DAVF may be mistaken for vascular or nonvascular brain pathologies. For that reason, within the differential diagnosis come a wide range of conditions, such as secondary headaches, encephalopathies, dementias including those with rapid progression, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory processes, or tumors typically at the orbital level or in the cavernous sinus. Diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion because of the multiplicity of symptoms and presentations, making this pathology an entity that provides a major challenge for clinicians, yet early and multidisciplinary treatment of high-grade fistulas improve the possibility of avoiding poor or unfavorable outcomes for the patient.

TI Metabolic Dysfunction in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: Current
   Theories and Updates
SO AGING AND DISEASE
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) without identifiable secondary causes. While the increased ICP is a critical diagnostic feature, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. Previous theories have suggested cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) overproduction, impaired reabsorption, or circulatory obstruction as potential causes. Emerging evidence indicates that IIH may not be solely a central nervous system disorder but also a systemic metabolic disorder. Metabolic and hormonal dysregulation features, including hyperleptinemia, adipocyte leptin hypersecretion, increased insulin resistance, and androgen excess, have been noted in IIH. Furthermore, the targeted blockade of the cortisol- producing enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has demonstrated therapeutic potential in treating IIH. Consequently, the role of metabolic dysfunction and hormonal imbalance in IIH warrants consideration. This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on current theories regarding the mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction in IIH.

   venous outflow and connective tissue disorders
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB BackgroundThere is increasing recognition of connective tissue disorders and their influence on disease in the general population. A conserved clinical phenotype involving connective tissue disorders and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and associated cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVD) has not been previously described.MethodsA single-institution retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients with connective tissue disorders and CVD was performed.ResultsA total of 86 patients were identified. The majority of these patients carried a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (55%) and most were non-obese (mean body mass index 29.7 kg/m2), Caucasian (90%) females (87%). Most prevalent presenting symptoms included pressure headache (98%), dizziness (90%), tinnitus (92%), and cognitive dysfunction (69%). Aside from CVD and IIH, the most common associated conditions were postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS; 55.8%), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks (51.2%), dysautonomia (45.3%), cranio-cervical instability (37.2%), mast cell activation syndrome (25.6%), and tethered cord syndrome (23.3%). Allergies to medications (87.2%) and surgical tape (19.8%) were also frequent. Despite significantly lower opening pressures on lumbar puncture, headache severity and quality of life scores were reported with the same severity of classic IIH patients, suggesting an underlying hypersensitivity to intracranial pressures and cerebral venous congestion.ConclusionThere is a rare but conserved clinical phenotype that has not been described previously that presents with severe IIH symptoms in predominantly young, non-obese Caucasian women with a high associated incidence of dysautonomia, POTS, craniocervical instability, and CSF leaks, among others.

TI Advanced cone-beam CT venous angiographic imaging
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE The evaluation of the venous neurovasculature, especially the dural venous sinuses, is most often performed using MR or CT venography. For further assessment, diagnostic cerebral angiography may be performed. Three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D-RA) can be applied to the venous system, producing 3D rotational venography (3D-RV) and cross-sectional reconstructions, which function as an adjunct to traditional 2D digital subtraction angiography.
   METHODS After querying the database of Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas, the authors reviewed the radiological and clinical data of patients who underwent 3D-RV. This modality was performed based on standard techniques for 3D-RA, with the catheter placed in the internal carotid artery and a longer x-ray delay calculated based on time difference between the early arterial phase and the venous phase.
   RESULTS Of the 12 cases reviewed, 5 patients had neoplasms invading a venous sinus, 4 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension required evaluation of venous sinus stenosis, 2 patients had venous diverticula, and 1 patient had a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst. The x-ray delay ranged from 7 to 10 seconds. The 3D-RV was used both for diagnosis and in treatment planning.
   CONCLUSIONS Three-dimensional RV and associated cross-sectional reconstructions can be used to assess the cerebral venous vasculature in a manner distinct from established modalities. Three-dimensional RV can be performed with relative ease on widely available biplane equipment, and data can be processed using standard software packages. The authors present the protocol and technique used along with potential applications to venous sinus stenosis, venous diverticula, and tumors invading the venous sinuses.

TI Management of Jugular Bulb Stenosis in Pediatric Vein of Galen
   Malformation: A Novel Management Paradigm
SO PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY
AB Introduction: Pediatric vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs) are fistulous intracranial malformations arising congenitally within the choroidal fissure that can present with an array of neurological and cardiac sequelae. Associated venous stenosis may result in intracranial venous hypertension and ischemia leading to severe, irreversible cerebral injury. Management of neonatal VOGMs typically involves staged embolization and angioplasty/stenting for relief of venous stenosis. Rarely, jugular foraminal narrowing has been identified as causing jugular bulb stenosis. Case Presentation: We present the case of a 22-month-old female diagnosed with VOGM prenatally who displayed persistent intracranial venous hypertension despite multiple neuroembolization procedures during the neonatal period. Following initial reduction in arteriovenous shunting, she once again developed venous hypertension secondary to jugular bulb stenosis for which angioplasty was attempted. Failure of angioplasty to relieve the venous hypertension prompted skull base imaging, which revealed jugular foraminal ossification and stenosis. Microsurgical jugular foraminotomy followed by balloon angioplasty and stenting significantly reduced jugular pressure gradients. Restenosis requiring re-stenting developed postoperatively at 9 months, but the patient has remained stable with significant improvement in cortical venous congestion. Discussion/Conclusion: This case demonstrates the efficacy of microsurgical decompression of the jugular foramen and endovascular angioplasty/stenting as a novel treatment paradigm for the management of intracranial venous hypertension in the setting of VOGM.

SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB A 47-year-old live kidney-donor woman presented with headaches and blurred vision. Neuro-ophthalmological examination demonstrated papilledema and right eye inferior nasal defect. Brain MRV showed no sinus thrombosis but solitary right venous sinus draining the torcular Herophili to right jugular bulb. Lumbar puncture revealed elevated CSF opening pressure of 40 cm H2O with normal composition. She was diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). She did not tolerate medical management and declined CSF diversion surgery. Cerebral angiography and venography showed venous outflow drainage from torcular Herophili through a solitary occipital sinus which has distal severe stenosis and pressure gradient of 10 mmHg. Balloon angioplasty and stenting of the occipital sinus were performed. Post-stenting, the stenosis and pressure gradient resolved. At 3-months follow-up, her symptoms and papilledema had resolved and CSF opening pressure was normal at 15 cm H2O. Aberrant cerebral venous anatomy may cause IIH and can be treatable with neuroendovascular techniques.

TI Effect of mannitol and hypertonic saline on cerebral oxygenation in
   patients with severe traumatic brain injury and refractory intracranial
   hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: The impact of osmotic therapies on brain oxygen has not been extensively studied in humans. We examined the effects on brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO(2)) of mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and refractory intracranial hypertension.
   Methods: 12 consecutive patients with severe TBI who underwent intracranial pressure (ICP) and PbtO(2) monitoring were studied. Patients were treated with mannitol (25%, 0.75 g/kg) for episodes of elevated ICP (> 20 mm Hg) or HTS (7.5%, 250 ml) if ICP was not controlled with mannitol. PbtO2, ICP, mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), central venous pressure and cardiac output were monitored continuously.
   Results: 42 episodes of intracranial hypertension, treated with mannitol (n = 28 boluses) or HTS (n = 14 boluses), were analysed. HTS treatment was associated with an increase in PbtO2 (from baseline 28.3 (13.8) mm Hg to 34.9 (18.2) mm Hg at 30 min, 37.0 (17.6) mm Hg at 60 min and 41.4 (17.7) mm Hg at 120 min; all p < 0.01) while mannitol did not affect PbtO2 (baseline 30.4 (11.4) vs 28.7 (13.5) vs 28.4 (10.6) vs 27.5 (9.9) mm Hg; all p > 0.1). Compared with mannitol, HTS was associated with lower ICP and higher CPP and cardiac output.
   Conclusions: In patients with severe TBI and elevated ICP refractory to previous mannitol treatment, 7.5% hypertonic saline administered as second tier therapy is associated with a significant increase in brain oxygenation, and improved cerebral and systemic haemodynamics.

TI Early Diagnosis and Management of Cerebral Venous Flow Obstruction
   Secondary to Transsinus Fracture after Traumatic Brain Injury
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROLOGY
AB Background and Purpose Cerebral venous flow obstruction (CVFO) is a fatal complication of traumatic brain injury To compare the outcomes of patients with CVFO secondary to traumatic-brain-injury-induced transsinus fracture who were diagnosed early versus those diagnosed late in the therapeutic course.
   Methods In total, 403 patients with transsinus fracture were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were divided into an early-diagnosis group (n=338) and a delayed-diagnosis group (n=65). The patients submitted to 2D time-of-flight magnetic resonance venography (2D-TOF MRV) and/or CT venography (CTV), depending upon the findings of intracranial pressure monitoring, in order to identify potentially complicated CVFO. These examinations took place within 3 days of the onset of malignant intracranial hypertension symptoms in the early-diagnosis group, and after an average of 7 days in the delayed-diagnosis group. Once diagnosed, patients received intravenous thrombolytic therapy with low-dose urokinase. Patients with massive transsinus epidural hematoma, depressed fracture, or cerebral hernia were treated surgically to relieve the compression and repair any damage to the venous sinuses.
   Results Cerebral venous flow obstruction was much more severe in the delayed-diagnosis group than in the early-diagnosis group (p<0.001), and hence patients in the former group were given a higher dose of urokinase (p<0.001) for thrombolytic therapy. They were also significantly more likely to need surgery (48.1% vs. 20.6%,p=0.003) and had a higher mortality rate (37.0% vs. 4.1%, p<0.001). However, patients in both groups experienced a similarly favorable prognosis, not only with regard to functional outcome but also with respect to neuroradiological improvement, as evaluated by 2D-TOF MRV/CTV at the final follow-up (p=0.218).
   Conclusions Delayed diagnosis can result in increased risk of surgery and death in the acute phase. Thrombolytic therapy with low-dose urokinase resulted in promising improvements in both functional and neuroradiological outcomes in all of the patients in this study, regardless of the time to diagnosis.

TI Cerebral venous sinus system and stenting in pseudotumor cerebri
SO CURRENT OPINION IN OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Purpose of review
   The pathogenesis and treatment paradigm for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is controversial. The goal of this article is to review the current literature addressing a relatively new and controversial therapeutic approach for a subset of IIH patients: dural venous sinus stenting.
   Recent findings
   The debate continues as to whether transverse sinus stenosis is a primary or secondary process relative to raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Transverse sinus stenosis is seen in the majority of patients with IIH and appears to play some role in the disease process. Recent case reports and case series that looked at patients treated with venous sinus stents show encouraging results in decreasing ICP and its related signs and symptoms. Venous sinus stenting could be a treatment option for many patients with IIH.
   Summary
   Exactly where in the treatment paradigm endovascular venous sinus stenting falls is unknown. Additional work, preferably controlled prospective studies, needs to be performed to prove its safety and efficacy. Finally, venous sinus stenting should be compared in head-to-head trials with optic nerve sheath fenestration and cerebrospinal fluid diversion surgeries to address its superiority or inferiority relative to these more traditional surgical options.

SO NEW HORIZONS-THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF ACUTE MEDICINE
AB Intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome have recently been "rediscovered" as causes of significant morbidity and mortality in critically ill surgical and medical patients. Increased intraabdominal pressure causes significant impairment of cardiac, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and central nervous system function, Rapid restoration of systemic perfusion through volume resuscitation and abdominal decompression is essential to the prevention of end-organ dysfunction and failure, Application of new monitoring techniques, such as intravesicular pressure monitoring and volumetric pulmonary artery catheters, greatly improves the intensivist's ability to diagnose accurately and resuscitate these patients. A high index of suspicion and early use of decompressive laparotomy and temporary abdominal wall closure techniques are fundamental to improving patient outcome.

TI Effect of Abdominal Insufflation for Laparoscopy on Intracranial
   Pressure
SO JAMA SURGERY
AB IMPORTANCE Increased abdominal pressure may have a negative effect on intracranial pressure (ICP). Human data on the effects of laparoscopy on ICP are lacking. We retrospectively reviewed laparoscopic operations for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement to determine the effect of insufflation on ICP.
   OBSERVATIONS Nine patients underwent insufflation with carbon dioxide (CO2) at pressures ranging from 8 to 15 mm Hg and ICP measured through a ventricular catheter. We used a paired t test to compare ICP with insufflation and desufflation. Linear regression correlated insufflation pressure with ICP. The mean ICP increase with 15-mm Hg insufflation is 7.2 (95% CI, 5.4-9.1 [P < .001]) cm H2O. The increase in ICP correlated with increasing insufflation pressure (P = .04). Maximum ICP recorded was 25 cm H2O.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intracranial pressure significantly increases with abdominal insufflation and correlates with laparoscopic insufflation pressure. The maximum ICP measured was a potentially dangerous 25 cm H2O. Laparoscopy should be used cautiously in patients with a baseline elevated ICP or head trauma.

TI EFFECTS OF A NEW DIURETIC ON CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID PRESSURE IN PATIENTS
   WITH SUPRATENTORIAL TUMORS
SO ARCHIV FUR PSYCHIATRIE UND NERVENKRANKHEITEN
AB The effect of a new powerful diuretic [Muzolimine, 3-amino-1-(3,4-dichloro-.alpha.-methylbenzyl)-2-pyrazolone] on biochemical parameters, urine output, central venous pressure, blood pressure and CSF pressure in patients with supratentorial intracerebral tumors who showed signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure was tested. When compared to an untreated control group and to the steady-state data of each patient, CSF pressure was significantly reduced using a dose of 240 mg of the diuretic. The 120 mg dosage did not produce significant results. Normalization of increased CSF pressure was not completely obtained using either dose. Used alone, this substance is not suitable for treatment of increased intracranial pressure due to brain edema in patients with intracerebral tumors. It might be useful in combination with other medications.

TI The Retrograde Ventriculovenous Shunts: The El-Shafei Retrograde
   Ventriculojugular and Ventriculosinus Shunts
SO PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY
AB Retrograde ventriculovenous (RVV) shunts utilize the impact pressure of the venous bloodstream to maintain the intraventricular pressure more than the pressure in the draining venous channel and to maintain a continuous flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the venous circulation at a rate equal to and dependent upon the rate of its formation regardless of changes in posture or intrathoracic pressure, create impact zones which discourage stagnation and clotting of blood at the venous end of the connection and utilize collapse of the internal jugular vein in the erect posture to prevent siphonage. During the past 40 years, 229 RVV shunts were implanted; 219 of the patients (95.63%) benefited from the shunt, and only 2 of them needed a single shunt revision. The manifestations of increased intracranial pressure disappeared, different degrees of regression of the ventriculomegaly occurred in patients with closed craniums but not in infants and young children with open craniums, and there were no problems related to improper CSF drainage or venous thrombosis. The follow-up period is up to 40 years (mean 9 years 8 months). Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

   American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma

SP Amer Assoc Surg Trauma
AB Objectives. Fluid therapy and/or acute lung injury may increase intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and intrathoracic pressure, thereby increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Further fluid administration to support cerebral perfusion or increasing ventilatory support to treat acute lung injury further increases ICP. This can create a cycle that ultimately produces multiple compartment syndrome (MCS). Both decompressive craniectomy (DC) and decompressive laparotomy (DL) decrease ICP. DL can also decrease IAP and ICP. We evaluated the serial application of DC and DL to treat MCS.
   Methods. Data were analyzed for 102 consecutive patients with severe TBI who underwent DC alone to decrease ICP or in combination with DL to treat MCS.
   Results: All 102 patients sustained blunt injury. Seventy percent were men with a mean age of 29.5 years, an Injury Severity Score of 34.4, and admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7.1. Fifty-one patients had diffuse brain injury and 51 had mass lesions. Seventy-eight patients (76%) underwent DC alone. Twenty-four (22%) had both therapies for MCS. Fifteen patients had DC before DL and nine had DL before DC. Mean time between DC and DL was 3.4 +/- 6 days. The mean IAP before DL was 28 +/- 5 turn Hg. Twenty-four-hour cumulative mean intrathoracic pressure decreased significantly after DL in the MCS group (p = 0.01). Mean ICP decreased significantly after both DC and DL (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion. Increased ICP may be from primary TBI or MCS. Patients with MCS have a higher Injury Severity Score, ICP, and fluid requirements, but no increase in mortality. Both DC and DL reduce ICP and can be used in sequence. MCS should be considered in multiply injured patients with increased ICP that does not respond to therapy.

TI An update on the management of pseudotumor cerebri
SO CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
AB Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is characterized by intracranial hypertension of unknown etiology typically in obese women <45 years of age, and can be disabling secondary to headaches and visual disturbances. Medical management includes pharmaceuticals that reduce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and lumbar punctures that reduce the CSF volume, both aimed at reducing intracranial pressure. When medical management fails, surgical CSF diverting procedures are indicated. Recently it has been demonstrated that dural sinus stenosis or thrombosis can be responsible for this disease and treated with endovascular venous stent placement. The intent of this educational manuscript is to review the clinical presentation of pseudotumor cerebri patients and discuss the medical, surgical, and endovascular treatment options for this disease. After reading this paper, the reader should be able to: (1) understand the pathophysiological basis of pseudotumor cerebri, (2) describe its presenting signs and symptoms, and (3) discuss the medical, surgical, and endovascular treatment options.

TI Tumefaction of the dural sinuses associated with a coagulopathy
   following treatment of hydrocephalus in a perinate - Case report
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB The authors describe an infant with abnormal development of the cerebral venous system associated with in utero ventriculomegaly and perinatal hemorrhage. When the patient was 6 weeks of age progressive ventriculomegaly followed by cerebrospinal fluid diversion resulted in tumefaction of the dural sinuses, intravascular thrombosis, and a coagulopathy. Oral anticoagulation therapy safely reversed the coagulopathy. Serial neuroimaging findings in this unique cascade of pathophysiological events indicated that, despite decreased intracranial pressure after shunt placement, local hemodynamic factors increased the venous resistance to flow and prolonged the transit time. Long-term anticoagulation therapy was associated with improvements in flow, transit time, and tumefaction.

TI Positive end-expiratory pressure increases intracranial pressure but not
   pressure reactivity index in supine and prone positions: a porcine model
   study
SO FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB Introduction: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prone positioning can improve gas exchange by promoting uniform lung aeration. However, elevated ventilation pressures may increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and disrupt cerebral autoregulation. This study investigated the effects of PEEP on ICP and cerebral autoregulation in a porcine model with healthy lungs and normal ICP, comparing prone and supine positions. Cerebral autoregulation was assessed through cerebrovascular reactivity using the pressure reactivity index (PRx). We also explored whether other baseline variables influenced potential variances in ICP and PRx. Methodology: Twelve anesthetized pigs were randomized to begin in either supine or prone position, across PEEP of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cmH(2)O. Continuous monitoring included esophageal pressure to calculate end-inspiratory and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressures. The ICM+(R) software (University of Cambridge Enterprise, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used for high-resolution data collection, signal processing and ICP curve analysis. Linear mixed-effects models and ANOVA were used to analyze changes in ICP and PRx and the influence of position. An exploratory correlation analysis was conducted on baseline variables potentially related to the ICP increase. Results: Mean ICP increase was 1.0 mmHg +/- 0.9 at 10 cmH(2)O PEEP, 2.0 mmHg +/- 1.7 at 15 cmH(2)O PEEP, and 3.1 mmHg +/- 1.6 at 20 cmH(2)O PEEP compared to a baseline PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O (p < 0.001). The effect of PEEP increase on ICP was not influenced by body position. PRx remained unaffected by PEEP. PEEP-induced increases in ICP were higher in cases of higher baseline ICP, higher central venous pressure, lower respiratory system elastance and lower end-inspiratory and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressures. Conclusion: Increasing PEEP elevates ICP regardless of body position without adversely affecting cerebral autoregulation in a healthy porcine model. Baseline ICP, central venous pressure, respiratory system elastance and end-inspiratory and end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure may influence the magnitude of ICP changes.

SO NEUROIMAGING CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB Pulsatile tinnitus from intracranial venous abnormalities is an uncommon cause of pulse synchronous tinnitus. Endovascular therapies may have applications in many of these disease conditions. They have the advantage of being minimally invasive and may selectively eliminate the site of turbulence. Venous stenting has been used successfully to treat venous stenoses with low complication rates and high success rates in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension though randomized controlled data are lacking. Careful exclusion of other causes of tinnitus should be performed before consideration for surgical or endovascular treatment of presumed causative lesions of venous tinnitus.

TI An Unusual Cause of Irritability in a Single Ventricle Patient after
   Bidirectional Glenn Shunt
SO CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE
AB The differential diagnosis for irritability in children is broad. In patients with congenital heart disease, one must strongly consider cardiac etiologies such as low cardiac output or elevated central venous pressure (CVP). In patients with single-ventricle physiology, the second stage of palliation includes bidirectional Glenn, which involves anastomosis of the superior vena cava to the pulmonary artery resulting in volume offloading of the single systemic ventricle. Typically, early in the post-operative period, patients may experience a headache due to the acute increase in CVP, and symptoms improve over time. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a rare neurologic disorder in children, characterized by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of brain parenchymal lesions or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities. While the pathogenesis of IIH is unknown, early recognition and treatment of IIH are important to prevent permanent vision loss. There are only rare reports of IIH in patients with Fontan circulation. To our knowledge, we report the first case of IIH in a 2-year-old female after bidirectional Glenn.

TI C1 Transverse Process Resection for Management of Jugular Stenosis
SO OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, often presents with severe headache and associated vision loss. Venous outflow obstruction has been noted as a prominent etiologic factor in many cases, and previous anatomic studies have shown that the internal jugular (IJ) vein at the skull base can be prone to compression by the neighboring bony structures.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a case of 13-yr-old male with a multifactorial intracranial hypertension including compression of the IJ vein by the transverse process of C1. Computerized tomography angiographic imaging revealed bilateral stenosis of the veins due to compression from the transverse processes of C1. Medical management and shunt were attempted without resolution of symptoms. A hemodynamically significant stenosis at the right IJ was confirmed with manometry and so the C1 transverse process was resected and a stent placed endovascularly with resolution of pressure gradient and clinical symptoms.
   CONCLUSION: Contribution of C1 compression to this patient's intracranial hypertension suggests that evaluation for IJ compression below the skull base may be needed to identify the underlying cause of intracranial hypertension in certain patients. Furthermore, surgical decompression of the IJ vein may be required as part of the treatment strategy. If venous stenting is being considered, this decompressive step must be taken before stenting is performed. We offer this case as evidence that decompression of the IJ vein by C1 lateral mass resection can be an effective and novel technique in the repertoire of neurosurgical management of intracranial hypertension.

AB Objective: To describe a real-time, continuous physiologic data acquisition system for the study of disease dynamics in the intensive care unit.
   Design: Descriptive report.
   Setting: A 16-bed pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care children's hospital.
   Patients: A total of 170 critically ill or injured pediatric patients.
   Interventions: None.
   Main Outcome Measures: None.
   Results: We describe a computerized data acquisition and analysis system for the study of critical illness and injury from the perspective of complex dynamic systems. Both parametric (1 Hz) and waveform (125-500 Hz) signals are recorded and analyzed. Waveform data include electrocardiogram, respiration, systemic arterial pressure (invasive and noninvasive), central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, left and right atrial pressures, intracranial pressure, body temperature, and oxygen saturation. Details of the system components are explained and examples are given from the resultant physiologic database of signal processing algorithms and signal analyses using linear and nonlinear metrics.
   Conclusions: We have successfully developed a real-time, continuous physiologic data acquisition system that can capture, store, and archive data from pediatric intensive care unit patients for subsequent time series analysis of dynamic changes in physiologic state. The physiologic signal database generated from this system is available for analysis of dynamic changes caused by critical illness and injury.

TI Tonsillar Herniation After Lumbar Puncture in Idiopathic Intracranial

SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB A 30-year-old woman with coexisting renal tubular acidosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), treated with acetazolamide, experienced coning (cerebellar tonsillar herniation) after a lumbar puncture (LP). Brain magnetic resonance imaging at initial diagnosis of IIH showed minor tonsillar descent and computed tomographic venography revealed hypoplasia of the left transverse sinus. The patient previously had three uneventful LPs, all of which showed high opening pressures and normal cerebrospinal fluid composition. In retrospect, it was noted that her serum bicarbonate had fallen to 9 mmol/L (normal: 22-28 mm/L) 1 week before the LP. We hypothesize that the combination of cerebral edema (due to worsening metabolic acidosis), poor venous drainage, and preexisting minor tonsillar descent contributed to her post-LP coning.

TI Experimental treatment of superior venous congestion during
   cardiopulmonary bypass
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
AB Superior venous outflow obstruction affects cerebral perfusion negatively by reducing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). We present a randomized study designed to compare two alternative strategies to preserve the CPP during superior vena cava (SVC) congestion and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
   Fourteen pigs on bi-caval CPB were subjected to 75% occlusion of the SVC flow. CPP was restored either by vasopressor treatment (VP, n = 7) or by partial relief (PR) of the congestion (n = 7). The cerebral effects of the interventions were studied for 60 min with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, cerebral blood flow measurement, the near-infrared light spectroscopy tissue oxygen saturation index (StO(2)), arterial and venous blood gas analyses and serial measurements of the glial cell damage marker protein S100 beta.
   Both strategies restored the CPP to baseline levels and no signs of severe ischaemia were observed. In the PR group, the venous and ICPs were normalized in response to the intervention, while in the VP group those parameters remained elevated throughout the experiment. The haemoglobin oxygen saturation in the sagittal sinus (SsagO(2)) was increased by both VP and PR, while significant improvement in the StO(2) was observed only in the PR group. The S100 beta concentrations were similar in the two groups.
   Experimental SVC obstruction during CPB may reduce the CPP, resulting in impaired cerebral perfusion. Both vasopressor treatment and improved venous drainage can, in the short term, individually restore the CPP during these circumstances.

TI Headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A CGRP-dependent head
   pain?
SO NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Headache is the most frequent and often the most severe symptom of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) clinical presentation, although pain characteristics are very variable among sufferers and the pain may even lack in some cases. Whatever the headache features, refractoriness to treatments, pain worsening in the recumbent position, and frequent awakenings with severe headache late in the night are the specific complains of such patients. However, a migraine or probable migraine headache, mostly with a chronic headache pattern, can be diagnosed in about 2/3 of the cases. In IIH cases without papilledema (IIHWOP), this leads to a high rate of misdiagnosis with primary chronic migraine (CM). Mechanisms responsible for the shared migrainous presentation of CM and IIH/IIHWOP may rely on a pathologic CGRP release from the rich trigemino-vascular innervated dural sinuses, congested in the course of raised intracranial pressure. The possible role of IIHWOP as a powerful and modifiable risk factor for migraine progression is discussed. Further studies investigating the possible efficacy of anti CGRP/receptor antibodies in IIH/IIHWOP headache treatment are needed.

TI Noninvasive continuous monitoring of the effects of head position on
   brain hemodynamics in ventilated infants
SO PEDIATRICS
AB Hypothesis. Laying supine with the head in midline position improves cerebral venous return by preventing functional occlusion of the vessels of the neck.
   Objectives. To assess changes in cerebral blood volume (DeltaCBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) with the position of the head in ventilated patients using a non-invasive method. The influence of the type of ventilation and birth weight was evaluated.
   Methods. Thirteen conventionally ventilated and 8 high-frequency oscillatory ventilated infants, with mean gestational ages and birth weights of 31 +/- 5 weeks (24-38) and 1575 +/- 803 g (560-3000), respectively, were studied 5.8 +/- 7.8 days (1-33) after birth. DeltaCBV (mL/100 g) and CBF (mL/100 g/min) were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy with the head in supine midline position (DeltaCBVs, CBFs) and rotated 90degrees to one side (DeltaCBVlat, CBFlat). Heart rate, peripheral saturation, transcutaneous PCO2, and blood pressure were monitored continuously. Ventilatory settings remained constant throughout the study period.
   Results. Mean DeltaCBVs was lower than mean DeltaCBVlat, although no changes in blood pressure, transcutaneous PCO2, oxygenation, or heart rate occurred. This change in DeltaCBV was not associated with the type of ventilation or birth weight, but the differences tended to be greater (dDeltaCBV = DeltaCBVlat-DeltaCBVs) in the smallest infants (< 1200 g). In contrast, CBF did not vary.
   Conclusion. The supine midline position of the head favors cerebral venous drainage and helps to prevent elevation of CBV.
   Speculation. This finding may be important in the first days of life, particularly in tiny preterm infants recovering from lung disease with improving lung compliance, in which functional obstruction of cerebral venous drainage should be avoided.

TI Intercompartmental communication between the cerebrospinal and adjacent
   spaces during intrathecal infusions in an acute ovine in-vivo model
SO FLUIDS AND BARRIERS OF THE CNS
AB Introduction The treatment of hydrocephalus has been a topic of intense research ever since the first clinically successful use of a valved cerebrospinal fluid shunt 72 years ago. While ample studies elucidating different phenomena impacting this treatment exist, there are still gaps to be filled. Specifically, how intracranial, intrathecal, arterial, and venous pressures react and communicate with each other simultaneously. Methods An in-vivo sheep trial (n = 6) was conducted to evaluate and quantify the communication existing within the cranio-spinal, arterial, and venous systems (1 kHz sampling frequency). Standardized intrathecal infusion testing was performed using an automated infusion apparatus, including bolus and constant pressure infusions. Bolus infusions entailed six lumbar intrathecal infusions of 2 mL Ringer's solution. Constant pressure infusions were comprised of six regulated pressure steps of 3.75 mmHg for periods of 7 min each. Mean pressure reactions, pulse amplitude reactions, and outflow resistance were calculated. Results All sheep showed intracranial pressure reactions to acute increases of intrathecal pressure, with four of six sheep showing clear cranio-spinal communication. During bolus infusions, the increases of mean pressure for intrathecal, intracranial, arterial, and venous pressure were 16.6 +/- 0.9, 15.4 +/- 0.8, 3.9 +/- 0.8, and 0.1 +/- 0.2 mmHg with corresponding pulse amplitude increases of 2.4 +/- 0.3, 1.3 +/- 0.3, 1.3 +/- 0.3, and 0.2 +/- 0.1 mmHg, respectively. During constant pressure infusions, mean increases from baseline were 14.6 +/- 3.8, 15.5 +/- 4.2, 4.2 +/- 8.2, and 3.2 +/- 2.4 mmHg with the corresponding pulse amplitude increases of 2.5 +/- 3.6, 2.5 +/- 3.0, 7.7 +/- 4.3, and 0.7 +/- 2.0 mmHg for intrathecal, intracranial, arterial, and venous pulse amplitude, respectively. Outflow resistances were calculated as 51.6 +/- 7.8 and 77.8 +/- 14.5 mmHg/mL/min for the bolus and constant pressure infusion methods, respectively-showing deviations between the two estimation methods. Conclusions Standardized infusion tests with multi-compartmental pressure recordings in sheep have helped capture distinct reactions between the intrathecal, intracranial, arterial, and venous systems. Volumetric pressure changes in the intrathecal space have been shown to propagate to the intraventricular and arterial systems in our sample, and to the venous side in individual cases. These results represent an important step into achieving a more complete quantitative understanding of how an acute rise in intrathecal pressure can propagate and influence other systems.

TI Persistent neurological symptoms and elevated intracranial pressures in
   a previously healthy host with cryptococcal meningitis
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis can occur in both previously healthy and immunocompromised hosts. Here, we describe a 55 year-old HIV-negative male with no known prior medical problems, who presented with three months of worsening headaches, confusion, and memory changes without fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated bilateral enlargement/enhancement of the choroid plexi, with hydrocephalus, temporal and occipital horn entrapments, as well as marked periventricular transependymal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seepage. CSF analysis yielded a lymphocytic pleocytosis and cryptococcal antigen titer of 1:160 but sterile fungal cultures. Despite standard antifungal therapy and CSF drainage, the patient had worsening confusion and persistently elevated intracranial pressures. External ventricular drainage led to improved mental status but only with valve settings at negative values. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement could thus not be considered due to a requirement for drainage into the positive pressure venous system. Due to this persistent CSF inflammation and cerebral circulation obstruction, the patient required transfer to the National Institute of Health. He was treated for cryptococcal post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome with pulse-taper corticosteroid therapy, with resultant reductions in CSF pressures along with decreased protein and obstructive material, allowing successful shunt placement. After tapering of corticosteroids, the patient recovered without sequelae. This case highlights (1) the necessity to consider cryptococcal meningitis as a rare cause of neurological deterioration in the absence of fever even in apparently immunocompetent individuals and (2) the potential for obstructive phenomena from inflammatory sequelae and the prompt response to corticosteroid therapy.

TI Suspected Low-Pressure Hydrocephalus Caused by Spinal Drainage after
   Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
SO JOURNAL OF NIPPON MEDICAL SCHOOL
AB Hydrocephalus induced by low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure is extremely rare and sporadically re-ported. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, head trauma, and spinal drainage were reported to be causative fac-tors for surgical treatment. A 33-year-old man with subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by right vertebral artery aneurysm rupture developed headache. Trapping surgery was performed, and a spinal drain was inserted from L4/5 for subarachnoid hemorrhage washout. On postoperative day 3, subdural fluid ac-cumulation had increased at the posterior fossa craniotomy site and the cerebellar sulci had narrowed; the ventricles were slightly enlarged. The patient reported headache during head elevation. Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) was suspected. After the spinal drain was removed, headache resolved, and cerebral ventriculomegaly disappeared. The subsequent clinical course was good. The patient was discharged 3 weeks after surgery. LPH is a rare disease caused by various factors and is treated by cor-recting liquorrhea or overdrainage, when present. Otherwise, drainage at negative CSF pressure is nec-essary. The symptoms and image findings for LPH are similar to those for intracranial hypertension and normal-pressure hydrocephalus. This report describes a suspected case of LPH caused by spinal drainage after subarachnoid hemorrhage and reviews the literature. (J Nippon Med Sch 2022; 89: 238?243)

SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Brain herniation into a dural venous sinus is a rare entity of unknown clinical significance without a clear relationship to raised intracranial pressure. There are yet to be detailed reports of interventional neuroradiology procedures involving sinus stenting across brain herniations. The authors of this paper present the first case of a stent placed across a large brain herniation into the transverse sinus in a patient with a tectal plate lesion and features of chronically raised intracranial pressure. This case demonstrates objective resolution of papilloedema and venous sinus pressure gradient at six months without complication.

   INDOMETHACIN
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Albino rabbits with experimental brain edema produced by a combined cryogenic left hemisphere and a metabolic 6-aminonicotinamide lesion were given indomethacin (20 mg/kg) 15 min prior to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment (1 g/kg bolus). Intracranial pressure (ICP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and EEG were continuously measured while the animals were being mechanically ventilated at a constant PaCO2 [arterial CO2 tension] (38-42 torr). At the end of the run, brain H2O and electrolytes were measured. There was no significant reductionin ICP at 5 and 15 min after DMSO. This was strikingly different to what occurred when DMSO alone was administered, when a significant reduction was noted (P < 0.05). At 30 min there was a reduction in ICP in both the DMSO and the DMSO/indomethacin groups, but in the former it was 50% of the pretreatment values while in the latter it was only 24%. Because indomethacin is a proven prostaglandin inhibitor, these substances may play a role in the mechanism of action of DMSO.

TI Comparison of venous sinus manometry gradients obtained while awake and
   under general anesthesia before venous sinus stenting
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Introduction Venous sinus stenting is a popular treatment strategy for patients with high venous sinus pressure gradients across a site of outflow obstruction. Little is known about the effect of anesthesia on venous sinus pressure measurements.
   Objective To compare venous manometry performed in patients under general anesthesia and while awake.
   Methods A prospective database was accessed to retrospectively identify patients who had undergone venous sinus stenting. Pressure gradients were compared between those patients who underwent manometry while awake and before stenting under general anesthesia.
   Results Thirty patients with both general anesthesia and awake pressure recordings were identified. Pressure measurements were highly variable but overall were higher under general anesthesia by an average of 5.8 mm Hg (1.7; p=0.002). A significant difference between awake and general anesthesia pressure measurements was detected in the sigmoid sinus (5.8 mm Hg (2.0); p=0.005) and the jugular vein (8.1 mm Hg (3.9); p=0.040). Only 11/30 (36.7%) pressure gradients remained within 5 mm Hg of the original awake gradient when repeated under general anesthesia; 9/30 (30%) patients had gradients that were at least 10 mm Hg different across procedures.
   Conclusions Calculated pressure gradients were markedly affected by anesthesia. These findings suggest that candidacy for stenting should be determined with venous manometry while patients are awake owing to the unpredictable and highly variable effect of general anesthesia on pressure measurements and an apparent tendency to underestimate the degree of venous outflow obstruction.

TI THE EFFECT OF ROUTINE NURSING-CARE PROCEDURES ON THE ICP IN SEVERE
   HEAD-INJURIES
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB The intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored in a number of patients who were being treated by mechanical ventilation for head injury. The effect on the pressure of routine nursing procedures was studied. Of 33 cases, 14 (group 1) showed small reversible rises in ICP during suction, insertion of a N/G [nasogastric] tube, or i.m. injections. These were associated with similar small increases in intrathoracic pressure and small fluctuations in arterial blood pressure. These rises were effectively treated with additional doses of relaxants. In a small group of patients (group 2) irreversible intracranial hypertension was induced by some of these stimuli, but did not respond to the administration of more relaxants, although sedatives such as papaveretum reduced it in some cases, but only slightly.

   three unusual lesions
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Background. We describe a treatment protocol for patients who have a dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVF) not curable solely by an endovascular approach.
   Material and methods. Three patients suffering from neurological impairment due to a complex dAVM (intracranial haemorrhage 2, intracranial hypertension 1) were treated by a combination of arterial embolization treatment and subsequent surgery.
   Results. Marked reduction of flow was achieved by embolization of the main arterial feeders of the fistulae. Surgery eliminated the residual dAVFs completely and without permanent morbidity.
   Conclusion. It is necessary to eliminate a dural fistula completely, especially in a patient whose fistula had drainage or reflux into cortical veins, which have a high risk of intracranial haemorrhage and venous hypertension. We present an approach to treatment using transarterial embolization and early surgery which may offer a safe and effective way to achieve complete elimination of the lesion, avoiding increased risk to important venous drainage.

TI Intraocular and Intracranial Pressures During Head-Down Tilt with Lower
   Body Negative Pressure
SO AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE
AB BACKGROUND: Seven astronauts after 6-mo missions to the International Space Station showed unexpected vision problems. Lumbar punctures performed in the four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal fluid pressure after returning to Earth. We hypothesized that lower body negative pressure (LBNP) imposed during head-down tilt (HDT) would reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) and transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitude, a noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) surrogate.
   METHODS: Participating in this study were 25 normal healthy nonsmoking volunteers (mean age: 36 yr). Subjects were positioned supine (5 min), sitting (5 min), 15 degrees whole body HDT (5 min), and 10 min of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg). The order of HDT and HDT+LBNP tests was balanced. Right and left IOP, transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitude, arm blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the last minute (steady state) of each testing condition.
   RESULTS: IOP significantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg (mean +/- SD:N = 25), and increased by 0.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg from supine to the HDT position. LBNP during HDT significantly lowered IOP to supine levels. In addition, LBNP significantly reduced transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitudes by 38% as compared to the HDT condition (N 5 9). Sitting mean blood pressure (BP) was signifi cantly higher (+5 mmHg) than BP values after 10 min of LBNP during HDT. However, heart rate was not signifi cantly different across all conditions.
   DISCUSSION: These data suggest that short duration exposures to LBNP attenuate HDT-induced increases in IOP and ICP.

TI Utility of CT venography in monitoring stent patency in idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension: retrospective single-center study
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background
   Cerebral venous sinus stenting is an established treatment for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), refractory to medical management and with stenotic venous sinus on conventional cerebral venography. Currently, there are no clear guidelines on optimal noninvasive imaging modality for routine post-stenting follow-up. We investigated diagnostic yield of CT venography (CTV) for evaluation of stent patency.
   Methods
   We reviewed our clinical database of patients with a diagnosis of IIH, who underwent stenting of stenotic transverse or transverse/sigmoid sinus junction. Patients who had follow-up CTVs after more than 30 days were included in the final study group. All CTVs were reviewed by two readers for in-stent thrombosis, extrinsic stent compression, juxta-stent stenosis, and new contralateral venous sinus stenosis. Inter-observer agreement and association of stent patency with clinical outcomes (headache and papilledema) were assessed.
   Results
   In all 36 included patients with 38 cerebral venograms for stenting, follow-up CTVs demonstrated adequate opacifications of the venous sinuses and stents for confident evaluation for in-stent thrombosis, extrinsic stent compression, juxta-stent stenosis, and new contralateral venous sinus stenosis, with inter-observer agreement coefficient of 0.7, 1.0, 0.8, and 1.0 respectively. Association between abnormal CTV and higher rates of persistent headache and lower rates of headache improvement/resolution was statistically significant (P-value of 0.01).
   Conclusion
   CTV is a reliable noninvasive imaging modality for evaluation of cerebral venous sinuses and stent patency following treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension with venous sinus stenting and could be used as a routine follow-up study.

This review summarizes recent developments and insights from leading treatment trials, emerging treatment options, and evolving ways to evaluate IIH.Recent findingsThe Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial is the first large-scale, randomized, prospective study to evaluate medical treatment of patients with mild vision loss. These data have facilitated our understanding of baseline clinical manifestations, including impact on quality of life and treatment outcomes. Recent hypotheses and studies evaluating the role of cerebral venous sinus stenosis and stenting are discussed. Technological advances in optical coherence tomography are emerging to provide novel ways of evaluating and tracking optic disc swelling in IIH.SummaryRecent changes in defining IIH, understanding the impact and treatment of mild visual loss, and the roles that cerebral venous stenting and optical coherence tomography might have in clinical practice provide the framework to better treat patients with IIH.

TI Venous Sinus Stenting Using a Ledge-Reducing Catheter, 0.088-in.
   Catheter-Extender With an External Single Point of Control: Technique
   and Multicenter Clinical Experience
SO STROKE-VASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL NEUROLOGY
AB Background Venous sinus stenting (VSS) is increasingly performed for managing venous sinus stenosis associated with refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension and/or pulsatile tinnitus. The Monopoint System (MS; Route 92 Medical, San Mateo, CA) is a telescoping catheter system with a single point of control outside the body, consisting of an 8F Guide Catheter (Base Camp), a 0.088-in. inner diameter catheter-extender (HiPoint 88), and a ledge-reducing delivery catheter (Tenzing 8). In this study, we describe the MS technique for VSS and our multicenter clinical experience. Methods We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who underwent VSS with the MS from 2022 to 2023 for intracranial hypertension and/or pulsatile tinnitus at 13 sites. Base Camp is placed in the internal jugular bulb. HiPoint 88 is advanced over the Tenzing 8 through the stenosis. The stent-delivery system is placed across the stenosis (inside the HiPoint 88), then unsheathed by HiPoint pull-back, followed by successful stent deployment. Operators were also surveyed on MS performance. Results Seventy-one patients were included, 97% female, mean age 40 +/- 11 years, body mass index 35 +/- 11. The primary indication for venous stenting was intracranial hypertension (79%, 56/71) and/or debilitating pulsatile tinnitus (87%, 62/71). Visual changes were present in 74%, with papilledema in 63%. Hipoint 88 advanced beyond the stenosis over Tenzing 8 in all cases, and all stents (diameters 6-10 mm and lengths 30-80 mm) successfully deployed. Median stenosis decreased from 80% (interquartile range 75-87) to 0% (interquartile range 0-0) post stenting (P<0.001). There were no Monopoint-related complications. compared with the operators' typical VSS catheter setup/technique, MS was rated "better" in 93% and "slightly better" in 6%; operators cited ease of crossing the stenosis, improved trackability and support, as well as lack of stent-catheter length incompatibilities. Headache, pulsatile tinnitus, and papilledema improved in 81%, 95%, and 91%, respectively. Conclusion The MS is a safe and effective catheter platform for VSS.

AB Background: Intracranial pressure changes during head impact cause brain injuries such as vasogenic edema and cerebral contusion. However, the influence of impulsive pressure on endothelial function has not yet been fully studied in vitro. In this study, we developed a pressure loading device that produced positive and negative pressures by modifying an in vitro fluid percussion model and examined the effects of the amplitude and duration of the pressures on endothelial permeability.
   Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were subjected to three types of positive pressure (average amplitude/average duration of 352 kPa/23 ms, 73 kPa/27 ms, and 70 kPa/44 ms) and three types of negative pressure (-72 kPa/41 ms, -67 kPa/104 ms, and -91 kPa/108 ms), and the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured between 15 min and 24 h after pressure loading for quantifying the formation of an integral monolayer of endothelial cells. After loading, vascular endothelial-(VE-) cadherin, an endothelium-specific cell-cell adhesion molecule involved in endothelial barrier function, was stained and observed using fluorescence microscopy.
   Results: The pressure loading device could produce positive pressure pulses with amplitudes of 53-1348 kPa and durations of 9-29.1 ms and negative pressure pulses with amplitudes of -52-93 kPa and durations of 42.9-179.5 ms. The impulsive pressure reduced the TEER associated with the change in VE-cadherin localization. Additionally, TEER decreased considerably at 15 min and 6 h post-loading, with these changes being significant in positive pressure with larger amplitude and shorter duration and in all types of negative pressures compared to pre-loading.
   Conclusions: The changes in intracranial pressure during head impact impair endothelial barrier function by the disruption of the integrity of endothelial cell-cell junctions, and the degree of increase in endothelial permeability depends on the amplitude, duration, and direction (compressive and tensile) of the impulsive pressure.

TI Impact of positive end expiratory pressure on cerebral hemodynamic in
   paediatric patients with post-traumatic brain swelling treated by
   surgical decompression
SO PLOS ONE
AB Introduction
   The objective of our present study is to evaluate the impact of different PEEP levels on cerebral hemodynamic, gas exchanges and respiratory system mechanics in paediatric patients with post-traumatic brain swelling treated with decompressive craniectomy (DC).
   Materials and methods
   A prospective physiologic study was carried out on 14 paediatric patients presenting with severe traumatic brain swelling treated with DC. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was performed on the middle cerebral artery bilaterally after DC. After assessment at ZEEP, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and gas exchanges were recorded at PEEP 4 and PEEP 8.
   Results
   From ZEEP to PEEP 8, the compliance of respiratory system indexed to the weight of the patient significantly increased (P = 0.02) without ICP modifications. No significant variation of the MAP, CPP, Vmed, the total resistance of respiratory system and ohmic resistance of the respiratory system indexed to the weight of the patients was observed. CVP significantly increased between ZEEP and PEEP 8 (P = 0.005), and between PEEP 4 and PEEP 8 (P = 0.05).
   Conclusions
   PEEP values up to 8 cmH20 seem to be safe in paediatric patients with a severe post-traumatic brain swelling treated with DC.

TI INFLUENCE OF HIGH RESPIRATORY RATE ON INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE
SO ANAESTHESIST
AB The influence of respiratory frequency, tidal volume, respiratory flow and ratio of inspiratory/expiratory time on ventilator-related intracranial pressure (ICP) fluctuations was studied in six patients with severe brain trauma. ICP fluctuations were found to be markedly reduced at frequencies of 20/min and usually eliminated at 30/min. We found an exponential correlation between ICP fluctuations and respiratory frequency, but there was no correlation between tidal volume and ICP. Central venous pressure amplitudes were found to be in linear correlation with respiratory frequency and tidal volumes as well. The amplitude of respiratory ICP fluctuations correlates with the length of expiratory time. Our findings demonstrate that artificial ventilation without ventilator-related fluctuations in ICP ("brain-protective" ventilation) may be performed by conventional volume-constant, time-cycled ventilators. To assess the therapeutic relevance of eliminating respiratory-related fluctuations of the ICP course in brain-injured patients, we suggest that frequencies of 25-30/min and tidal volumes of 6-9 ml/kg bodyweight should be used.

TI Monitoring of cerebrospinal fluid pressure during embolization of AVM
SO MINIMALLY INVASIVE NEUROSURGERY
AB We experienced that therapeutic embolization of a large cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) led to venous outflow obstruction resulting in intracranial hypertension in a patient who had undergone external decompression. To evaluate hemodynamic changes after embolization, we monitored the cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the next four patients who underwent endovascular treatment. The embolization of a medium AVM resulted in a slight increase in the cerebrospinal fluid pressure. In two medium AVMs, embolization produced slight decreases in the cerebrospinal fluid pressure. In a small AVM, we did not observe any changes in the cerebrospinal fluid pressure during the endovascular treatment. We discuss the mechanism of changes in the intracranial pressure after embolization and conclude that monitoring of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure immediately yields useful information for hemodynamic changes during endovascular treatment.

TI Low- and Negative-Pressure Hydrocephalus: New Report of Six Cases and
   Literature Review
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB Low- or very-low-pressure hydrocephalus is a serious and rare phenomenon, which is becoming better known since it was first described in 1994 by Pang and Altschuler. Forced drainage at negative pressures can, in most cases, restore the ventricles to their original size, thus achieving neurological recovery. We present six new cases that suffered this syndrome from 2015 to 2020: two of them after medulloblastoma surgery; a third one as a consequence of a severe head trauma that required bifrontal craniectomy; another one after craniopharyngioma surgery; a fifth one with leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor; and, finally, a patient with a shunt for normotensive hydrocephalus. Before the development of this condition, four of them had mid-low-pressure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts. Four patients required cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage at negative pressures oscillating from zero to -15 mmHg by external ventricular drainage until ventricular size normalized, followed by the placement of a new definitive low-pressure shunt, one of them to the right atrium. The duration of drainage in negative pressures through external ventricular drainage (EVD) ranged from 10 to 40 days with concomitant intracranial pressure monitoring at the neurointensive care unit. Approximately 200 cases of this syndrome have been described in the literature. The causes are varied and superimposable to those of high-pressure hydrocephalus. Neurological impairment is due to ventricular size and not to pressure values. Subzero drainage is still the most commonly used method, but other treatments have been described, such as neck wrapping, ventriculostomy of the third ventricle, and lumbar blood patches when associated with lumbar puncture. Its pathophysiology is not clear, although it seems to involve changes in the permeability and viscoelasticity of the brain parenchyma together with an imbalance in CSF circulation in the craniospinal subarachnoid space.

TI Raised venous pressure as a factor in multiple sclerosis
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB It is hypothesised that the inflammatory condition seen in MS and the progressive myelopathy that is being successfully halted by obliteration of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs), may actually be two sides of the same coin. Excessive venous hypertension can stretch vein walls sufficiently to separate the tight junctions between endothelial cells forming the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Colloids, etc., but not necessarily erythrocytes, could then pass through the exposed porous basement membranes. The resulting changes in osmotic pressure, etc. would disrupt the axon and dendrite internal transport systems, leading to their disintegration. The normal inflammatory processes which would follow, might be indistinguishable from those associated with autoimmune disease.
   Ascending progressive myelopathy and disablement are associated with an intracranial DAVF when its outflow enters the spinal venous system and descends past the cervical region. This can be arrested, and some degree of recovery produced, if the DAVF can be successfully eliminated or blocked. However, if the DAVF outflow is entirety into the spine, intracranial venous pressure may be normal and so there is nothing to alert the clinician to the presence of an intracranial DAVF.
   It is suggested that where spinal MS has been diagnosed from clinical observations, patients should be referred for angiological investigation to search for DAVFs within the head to identify any treatable subjects. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Long-term Outcomes of Cerebral Venous Sinus Stenosis Corrected by
   Stenting
SO CURRENT NEUROVASCULAR RESEARCH
AB Background and Purpose: Cerebral Venous Sinus Stenosis (CVSS) usually results in severe Intracranial Hypertension (IH), which can be corrected by stenting immediately. However, there is a lack of evidence of the long-term good outcomes in patients with CVSS who underwent stenting.
   Methods: A total of 62 patients with imaging confirmed non-thrombotic and non-external compression CVSS were enrolled into this single center real-world cohort study after undergoing stenting, and were continuously followed up for more than 12 years. The symptoms and signs of IH prior to stenting and post-stenting and the incidence of restenosis after stenting were analyzed.
   Results: The mean age of the 62 patients (range, 13 to 62) was 40 years old, and the mean body mass index was 26 (range 23 to 40). Females accounted for 67.7% (42/62). Headache was the most common symptom (79%). Transient visual obscurations occurred in 69% of the patients. 42% of the patients suffered from visual loss, 11.3% pulsatile tinnitus, and 96.8% Papilledema before stenting. The mean trans-stenotic pressure gradients were 6-43 mml Ig prior to stenting and returned to 0-4 mm Hg after stent placement. During the following 12-126 months (the median was 62) after stenting of the follow-up, 91.9% (57/62) of the patients obtained good outcomes. Headaches disappeared in 96% (47/49) of the patients and papilledema was attenuated in 98.3% (59/60). However, There were still 8.0 % (5/62) of the patients with poor outcomes, including optic disc atrophy in 3 patients and stent-interior thrombosis in 2 patients, which occurred 6.3 months after stenting.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that stenting may be a promising therapy for CVSS correcting. Patients with CVSS may get long-term benefit from stenting, especially when they are accompanied with severe IH.

TI A Review of the Methods of Non-Invasive Assessment of Intracranial
   Pressure through Ocular Measurement
SO BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB The monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) is essential for the detection and treatment of most craniocerebral diseases. Invasive methods are the most accurate approach to measure ICP; however, these methods are prone to complications and have a limited range of applications. Therefore, non-invasive ICP measurement is preferable in a range of scenarios. The current non-invasive ICP measurement methods comprise fluid dynamics, and ophthalmic, otic, electrophysiological, and other methods. This article reviews eight methods of non-invasive estimation of ICP from ocular measurements, namely optic nerve sheath diameter, flash visual evoked potentials, two-depth transorbital Doppler ultrasonography, central retinal venous pressure, optical coherence tomography, pupillometry, intraocular pressure measurement, and retinal arteriole and venule diameter ratio. We evaluated and presented the indications and main advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Although these methods cannot completely replace invasive measurement, for some specific situations and patients, non-invasive measurement of ICP still has great potential.

TI Intracranial Venous Hypertension in Craniosynostosis: Mechanistic
   Underpinnings and Therapeutic Implications
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB Patients with complex, multisutural, and syndromic craniosynostosis (CSO) frequently exhibit intracranial hypertension. The intracranial hypertension cannot be entirely attributed to the craniocephalic disproportion with calvarial restriction because cranial vault expansion has not consistently alleviated elevated intracranial pressure. Evidence has most strongly supported a multi-factorial interaction, including venous hypertension along with other pathogenic processes. Patients with CSO exhibit marked venous anomalies, including stenosis of the jugular-sigmoid complex, transverse sinuses, and extensive transosseous venous collaterals. These abnormal intracranial-extracranial occipital venous collaterals might represent anomalous development, with persistence and subsequent enlargement of channels normally present in the fetus, either as a primary defect or as nonregression in response to failure of the development of the jugular-sigmoid complexes. It has been suggested by some investigators that venous hypertension in patients with CSO could be treated directly via jugular foraminoplasty, venous stenting, or jugular venous bypass, although these options are not in common clinical practice. Obstructive sleep apnea, occurring as a consequence of midface hypoplasia, can also contribute to intracranial hypertension in patients with syndromic CSO. Thus, correction of facial deformities, as well as posterior fossa decompression, could also play important roles in the treatment of intracranial hypertension. Determining the precise mechanistic underpinnings underlying intracranial hypertension in any given patient with CSO requires individualized evaluation and management.

TI Venous sinus stenting after repair of skull base spontaneous
   cerebrospinal fluid leaks: A single-center retrospective cohort series
   with case-control analysis
SO JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Background: Management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is recommended after surgical repair of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks (sCSF-leaks) of the skull base for prevention of recurrence.
   Purpose: To assess the feasibility of venous sinus stenting, a treatment commonly used for the treatment of IIH associated with intracranial venous sinus stenosis (VSS), after sCSF-leaks closure.
   Materials and methods: A single-center cohort series of consecutive patients who underwent sCSF-leak closure was retrospectively analyzed. Stenting was considered either for leak recurrence or in prophylactic manner after repair in patients with VSS as confirmed by cerebral venous imaging. Leak recurrence, need for new repair or adjunctive treatment of IIH, meningitis, and stenting complications were determined at the last follow-up. Cases who had prophylactic stenting were compared to historical controls before stenting option.
   Results: Twenty-two patients had intracranial venous stenting after sCSF-leak closure. Their median age was 58 years (Q1=45; Q3=68), BMI=31 kg.m(2) (Q1=27; Q3=36), and female rate=85%. The overall rate of successful repair after stenting was 95% (95% CI = 87-100%) at a median follow-up of 2.4 years (Q1=1.2; Q3=3.3). Adjunctive treatment for IIH was needed in 4 patients (4/22, 18%) including 2 patients without leak recurrence. No meningitis, permanent morbidity or mortality was observed after stenting. Compared to 18 controls, cases had significantly less recurrence (P = 0.03), and a trend for less adjunctive treatment for IIH (P = 0.06).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that stenting might be a valid option for prevention of sCSF-leak recurrences after repair in patients with intracranial venous sinus stenosis. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI The lesson of chronic migraine
SO NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB The hypothesis that central sensitization/allodynia is the common final mechanism responsible for the progression of migraine pain is supported by the possibility of tracing back to allodynic mechanisms the action of the main risk factors for chronic migraine validated by the recent literature. The comorbidity between migraine and idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema is emerging as a new, commonly overlooked risk factor for migraine progression whose putative mechanism might also converge on the sensitization of central pain pathways. If headache progression always occurs at the end of a pathogenetic sequence typical of an individual susceptibility to allodynia, then the primary character of chronic migraine might be debated. Allodynia is not specific to migraine but is implied in the progressive amplification of pain after repeated stimuli, a universal adaptive phenomenon. Being largely conditioned by the individual comorbidity profile, allodynia may only in part be defined as primary in itself. Many migraine comorbid conditions, including a hidden idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema, may emphasize susceptibility to allodynia and promote chronic migraine. These factors and comorbid conditions require to be individually assessed and adequately treated to optimize the therapeutic response.

SO ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Neuroanaesthesia is an expanding specialty that requires a good understanding of neurophysiology as well as the pathophysiology of raised intracranial pressure. Neuroanaesthetists need to ensure neurosurgical patients maintain an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure intraoperatively, whist providing optimum operating conditions. To achieve this, a balanced anaesthetic technique preventing hypertensive surges and optimizing cerebral venous drainage by careful patient positioning is important. Knowledge of the therapeutic options available to the anaesthetist for decreasing ICP intraoperatively is essential. As neurosurgery evolves, it provides neuroanaesthetists with new challenges including awake craniotomies, stereotactic neurosurgery and intraoperative MRI.

SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Case report: A 20-year-old female born with a thoracic level myelomeningocele, Chiari II malformation, and hydrocephalus treated at birth developed clinical features of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to shunt malfunction. The patient became comatose. Her ICP remained high despite a functioning shunt and even after the ventricular catheter was exteriorized. Diagnostic imaging consistently demonstrated slit-like ventricles, a Chiari II malformation, and a tethered spinal cord. We attributed her neurological condition either to brainstem compression or increased ICP related to venous outlet obstruction at the foramen magnum. Outcome: The patient improved rapidly after undergoing a Chiari II decompression and placement of a shunt from the cisterna magna and upper cervical subarachnoid space to the peritoneum connected by a "Y" connector to the ventricular catheter. Conclusion: The complex hydrocephalus was effectively treated by this concurrent ventricular and cisterna magna-to-peritoneum shunt.

TI Venous sinus stenting lowers the intracranial pressure in patients with
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Aims We report the cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure (CSF-OP) measurements obtained before and after venous sinus stenting (VSS) in 50 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
   Methods The CSF-OP was measured with a spinal tap 3 months before and 3 months after treatment. All data were prospectively collected and included patient demographics, weight (kg), body mass index (BMI), acetazolamide daily dosage (mg), procedural details, complications, venous sinus pressures (mm Hg), transstenotic pressure gradient (mm Hg), transverse sinus symmetry, and type of venous sinus stenosis.
   Results The average pretreatment CSF-OP was 37 cm H2O (range 25-77) and the average posttreatment CSF-OP was 20.2 cm H2O (range 10-36), with an average reduction of 16.8 cm H2O (P< 0.01). The post-treatment CSF-OP was less than 25 cm H2O in 40/50 patients. The average acetazolamide daily dose decreased from 950 mg to 300 mg at the time of 3-month follow-up (P< 0.01). No patient required an increase in acetazolamide dose 3 months after VSS. The average weight before treatment was 95.4 kg with an average BMI of 35.41. There was an average increase in body weight of 1.1 kg at the 3-month follow-up with an average increase in BMI of 0.35 (P= 0.03).
   Conclusions We provide evidence that there is a significant decrease in CSF-OP in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension 3 months after VSS, independent of acetazolamide usage or weight loss.

TI Epidural anesthesia and acutely increased intracranial pressure - Lumbar
   epidural space hydrodynamics in a porcine model
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Background: The effects of epidural injection on Intracranial pressure (ICP), lumbar epidural pressure, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) were studied after acutely increased ICP in swine.
   Methods: Twenty pigs, anesthetized with isoflurane and mechanically ventilated to maintain normocarbia, had two Tuohy needles placed in the lumbar epidural space, The ICP, lumbar epidural pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and central venous pressure were monitored. All animals had a Fogarty catheter pieced in the parietal epidural space. Six pigs were randomized to a normal ICP group (group N) and eight pigs to an increased ICP group by inflation of the Fogarty catheter balloon (group R). Each pig had 0.33 ml . kg(-1) of 2.0% carbonated lidocaine injected over 20 s via an epidural needle placed at L3. The ICP and lumbar epidural pressure mere then monitored continuously for 30 min. Pressure-time data were fit to traditional compartmental models. Epidural elastance and resistance were calculated using a derivation of the Windkessel theory. An additional six pigs bad ICP elevated as in group R and CBF and SCBF measured using radioactive microspheres at five time periods: baseline, 0-60 s, 100-160 s, 200-260 s, and at 30 min after epidural injection.
   Results: The animals did not differ with respect to heart rate, central venous pressure, or mean arterial pressure at baseline. The ICP was 10 +/- 2 mmHg in group N, and 24 +/- 2 mmHg after balloon inflation in group R. After epidural injection, peak ICP was significantly greater in group R (76 +/- 22 vs. 54 +/- 17 mmHg) but not different by 30 min (17 +/- 5 vs, 11 +/- 1 mmHg). Epidural elastance in group N was 8.3 +/- 3.1 mmHg . ml(-1) and 12.8 +/- 5.0 mmHg . ml(-1) in group R (P = 0.045). Epidural resistance was 1,330 +/- 590 mmHg . s . ml(-1) in group N and 2,220 +/- 600 mmHg . s . ml(-1) in group R (P = 0.038). The CBF and SCBF were less than 10% of baseline during the 0- to 60-s time period after epidural injection. Thereafter, CBF and SCBF did not differ from baseline values.
   Conclusions: in this porcine model, epidural injection increased ICP. With increased ICP at baseline, more pronounced increases in ICP followed epidural injection. With increased baseline ICP, both epidural elastance and resistance increased compared with controls. The CBF and SCBF were markedly reduced immediately after local anesthetic injection into the epidural space.

TI THE PSEUDOTUMOR SYNDROME - DISORDERS OF CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID CIRCULATION
   CAUSING INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION WITHOUT VENTRICULOMEGALY
SO ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY
AB We report a series of eight cases that show a close resemblance to, but are not identical with, pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) as normally defined. The majority of these cases are characterized by raised intracranial pressure without ventriculomegaly. They include two cases of cranial venous outflow obstruction in which clinical or radiologic abnormalities precluded the diagnosis of PTC proper (cases 1 and 2); one case of chronic meningitis in which an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition precluded the diagnosis of PTC (case 3); two cases without either papilledema or a measured increase of CSF pressure, which in other respects, particularly in response to treatment, resembled PTC (cases 4 and 5); and three cases of what is thought to represent an infantile form of PTC (cases 6 through 8). The purpose of the analysis of these cases is twofold. First, it is argued that these cases throw light on the mechanism of PTC itself, supporting a concept of a disturbance of CSF circulation in this condition, and that they are themselves illuminated by considerations of typical PTC. Second, the cases are used to frame a proposed classification of the pseudotumor syndrome aimed at broadening the diagnostic criteria applied currently to PTC. It is suggested that the pseudotumor syndrome has a single underlying mechanism (disturbed CSF circulation) and that recognition of this mechanism not only clarifies the pathophysiologic processes of PTC but also has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

TI Weight and Abdominal Pressure-Induced Shunt Trouble in Patients With
   Shunted Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus: A Comprehensive Study on Pressure
   Environment of Shunt System
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB ObjectivesWe identified a new type of shunt malfunction (SM) in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). It is induced by weight change and can be treated with valve readjustment. There were two types of SM as follows: Underdrainage induced by the weight gain and overdrainage induced by the weight loss. This study aims to elucidate this mechanism by assessing the shunt pressure environment. MethodsThe total pressure environment of the shunt system was prospectively studied in patients with shunted NPH at Osaka Medical College Hospital from 1999 to 2005. We measured the pressure environment during the initial pressure setting of the valve by the intracranial pressure (ICP) guide, after setting the valve, and when SM was suspected. We evaluated ICP, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), and hydrostatic and perfusion pressures of the shunt system in the sitting and supine positions. The target ICP for valve setting was empirically set at the range from -8 to -13 mm Hg in the sitting position, referring to the external auditory meatus. During the study period, we identified five cases of SM induced by weight change and assessed the changes in the pressure environment across pre-SM, SM, and post-SM. ResultsIn four cases of underdrainage, gait disturbance worsened with an average weight gain of 6.8 +/- 1.2 kg. With weight gain, IAP and ICP increased by 8.8 +/- 1.6 and 4.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, respectively. Consequently, ICP increased to -6.5 +/- 1.9 mm Hg. One overdrainage patient developed an asymptomatic chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) with a weight loss of 10 kg. With the weight loss, both IAP and ICP decreased by 5 mm Hg, and concomitantly, ICP decreased to -18 mm Hg. In all patients, the valve readjustment restored their ICP to the target pressure. After the valve readjustment, the gait disturbance improved immediately, and the CSDH disappeared after 1 month. ConclusionIn patients with shunts, the weight change was linked to ICP via IAP. Due to the weight change, the underdrainage occurred when ICP was above the target pressure, and the overdrainage occurred when ICP was below it. We named this SM as the weight and abdominal pressure-induced shunt trouble. The patients with SM along with weight changes should be the first to be tried for the valve readjustment.

TI Postural changes in intracranial pressure in chronically shunted
   patients
SO PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY
AB A subset of hydrocephalic patients with indwelling shunts become symptomatic when they are upright and active. Intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements in these patients have shown a significant drop in pressure when the patient is upright with return to normal levels when the patient is supine. In 20 chronically shunted hydrocephalic patients who previously had no siphon protection devices, ICP changes in supine and upright position were studied at the time when the patient had external ventriculostomy for treatment of shunt infection. Our hypothesis was that these patients might display rapid changes in ICP from fluid shifts occurring in non-CSF compartments, To minimize the effects of hysteresis, drift and zero-point error, measurements were made using a fluid manometer rather than a strain gauge pressure transducer, The pressure-volume index was estimated using the standard technique of bolus injection. Intracranial CSF volume was estimated on CT scans. The fluid shift was calculated using a mathematical model of the CSF compartment that incorporates negative pressure and volume components that permits simulation of siphoning. Sixteen patients had small, slit ventricles; 3 patients had moderate-sized ventricles and in 1 patient the ventricular size was normal. The average intracranial CSF volume estimated on CT scan was 12 cm(3), There was a mean drop in ICP in the upright position of 159 mm H2O. The mean PVI of 42 mi suggested a volume displacement out of proportion to the available intracranial CSF volume. Based on these findings, we conclude that even in the absence of drainage through the shunt, chronically shunted patients still display a fall in ICP when assuming the upright position. This raises the possibility of fluid shifts other than of CSF through nonshunt pathways. Possible mechanisms involving altered CSF-venous system interaction are discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 S.

TI NEGATIVE-PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Two cases of children with closed myelodysplasia, Arnold-Chiari malformation, and shunted hydrocephalus who underwent spinal arachnoid cystopleural shunting are presented. Postoperatively, both patients developed craniovertebral symptomatology accompanied by radiologically documented ventricular dilation in spite of negative intracranial pressure and functional ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. Both patients recovered after the cystopleural shunts were revised to increase the resistance to flow within the system. The authors believe that some communication between the arachnoid cyst and the subarachnoid space existed in both cases and that the negative pleural pressure was transmitted preferentially to the spinal and cerebral convexity subarachnoid spaces with relative sparing of the ventricular system. A transmantle pressure gradient was thereby established, leading to ventricular dilation. The authors further suggest that a craniospinal gradient was possibly established as well, leading to craniovertebral symptomatology in the patients. Return of flow in the VP shunts was obtained by correcting this iatrogenic transmantle pressure gradient.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension secondary to Superior Sagittal
   Sinus Stenosis: a case report
SO NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Introduction Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) without established etiology. Venous sinus stenosis contributes to IIH; however, it is still uncertain whether the stenosis is a primary cause of IIH or a secondary result in response to elevated ICP. Transverse sinus stenosis is frequently identified in patients with IIH and it is suggestive of raised ICP. Here, we report a case of IIH caused by intrinsic superior sagittal sinus stenosis (SSS). Case presentation A 43-year-old man suffered from IIH with headache, papilledema, and visual impairment. Angiography demonstrated isolated SSS stenosis with a pressure gradient of 30 mmHg. SSS stenosis was resistant to revascularization by stenting alone and intrastent balloon angioplasty was then performed to overcome such resistance. The rigidity of the vein wall suggests that the vein is not collapsed and the stenosis is intrinsic, secondary to idiopathic anatomical local changes. Post-procedure headache disappeared and visual acuity improved. Conclusion An isolated SSS stenosis could lead to intracranial hypertension and this condition should be taken into account in the diagnostic workup of IIH. By now, SSS stenosis is not mentioned in any current consensus guidelines or paper on the diagnostic workflow of intracranial hypertension.

TI Effect of regulating airway pressure on intrathoracic pressure and vital
   organ perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a
   non-randomized interventional cross-over study
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB Background: The objective of this investigation was to evaluate changes in intrathoracic pressure (Ppl), airway pressure (Paw) and vital organ perfusion pressures during standard and intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR)-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
   Methods: Multiple CPR interventions were assessed, including newer ones based upon IPR, a therapy that enhances negative intrathoracic pressure after each positive pressure breath. Eight anesthetized pigs underwent 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation followed by 2 min each of sequential interventions: (1) conventional standard CPR (STD), (2) automated active compression decompression (ACD) CPR, (3) ACD+ an impedance threshold device (ITD) CPR or (4) ACD+ an intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR) CPR, the latter two representing IPR-based CPR therapies. Intrapleural (Ppl), airway (Paw), right atrial, intracranial, and aortic pressures, along with carotid blood flow and end tidal CO2, were measured and compared during each CPR intervention.
   Results: The lowest mean and decompression phase Ppl were observed with IPR-based therapies [Ppl mean (mean +/- SE): STD (0.8 +/- 1.1 mmHg); ACD (-1.6 +/- 1.6); ACD-ITD (-3.7 +/- 1.5, p < 0.05 vs. both STD and ACD); ACD-ITPR (-7.0 +/- 1.9, p < 0.05 vs. both STD and ACD)] [Ppl decompression (mean +/- SE): STD (-6.3 +/- 2.2); ACD (-13.0 +/- 3.8); ACD-ITD -16.9 +/- 3.6, p < 0.05 vs. both STD and ACD); ACD-ITPR -18.7 +/- 3.5, p < 0.05 vs. both STD and ACD)]. Interventions with the lower mean or decompression phase Ppl also demonstrated lower Paw and were associated with higher vital organ perfusion pressures.
   Conclusions: IPR-based CPR methods, specifically ACD-ITPR, yielded the most pronounced reduction in both Ppl and Paw and resulted in the most favorable augmentation of hemodynamics during CPR.

TI Impedance threshold device as a countermeasure for spaceflight
   associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS): Mitigating mechanisms in
   proposed pathophysiology
SO LIFE SCIENCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
AB Long-duration spaceflight (LDSF) is associated with unique hazards and linked with numerous human health risks including Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). The proposed mechanisms for SANS include microgravity induced cephalad fluid shift and increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP). SANS is a disorder seen only after LDSF and has no direct terrestrial pathologic counterpart as the zero G environment cannot be completely replicated on Earth. Head-down tilt, bed rest studies however have been used as a terrestrial analog and produce the cephalad fluid shift. Some proposed countermeasures for SANS include vasoconstrictive thigh cuffs and lower body negative pressure. Another potential researched countermeasure is the impedance threshold device (ITD) which can reduce ICP. We review the mechanisms of the ITD and its potential use as a countermeasure for SANS.

TI Intracranial venous sinus stenosis: hemodynamic assessment with
   two-dimensional parametric parenchymal blood flow software on digital
   subtraction angiography
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Objective Intracranial venous sinus stenosis (IVSS) is the most common finding associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A pressure gradient >8-10 mm Hg across the stenosis is considered hemodynamically significant, and typically responds to endovascular stent treatment. Here we assess the venous hemodynamics with two-dimensional (2D) parametric parenchymal blood flow software (Siemens-Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany) and its ability to predict significant IVSS.
   Methods Patients with IVSS treated at our institution between 2013 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Measurements of contrast transit time on DSA were calculated with 2D parametric parenchymal blood flow software. Values were obtained proximally and distally to the stenotic region. Venous Stenosis Index (VSI) was defined as the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) in the pre-stenotic vessel to the AUC in the post-stenotic vessel. VSI was compared between the stenotic and control groups at baseline, and before and after stent deployment in the stenotic group. The accuracy of VSI was assessed using the non-parametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
   Results 11 patients with IVSS treated with venous stent deployment were included. Patients in the control group were similar in age, gender, and absence of major comorbidities. VSI in the IVSS group was significantly higher at baseline compared with the control group (1.42 vs 0.97, p=0.01). Area under the ROC was 0.82. After stent deployment, VSI decreased significantly compared with baseline (1.04 vs 1.42, p<0.01).
   Conclusion 2D parametric parenchymal blood flow software is a useful tool which can accurately evaluate significant hemodynamic venous stenosis without intracranial catheterization, added radiation exposure, additional contrast injection, and periprocedural risks.

TI Exertional headache: a new venous disease
SO CEPHALALGIA
AB Primary exertional headache is coded as a separate entity within the International Headache Society's (IHS) classification system (1), but the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this clinical headache subtype are unknown. The IHS criteria for this diagnosis require the exclusion of systemic or intracranial disorders (Table 1).
   Moreover, the significantly higher prevalence of venous outflow obstruction as an aetiological factor of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has been previously suggested, based on manometry and neuroradiological findings, and led to stent placement with promising results (2). These preliminary results were very recently confirmed (3). However, the safety and efficacy of this technique should be evaluated further in larger series with longer follow-up to be definitely validated.
   We report one case of severe exertional headache for which venous magnetic resonance (VMR) led to the discovery of bilateral transverse sinus stenosis.

TI Optimizing the circulation in the prone patient
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB Purpose of review
   Prone positioning is recommended as a rescue therapy to improve arterial oxygenation in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this review, we summarize the macro and the microcirculatory effects of prone positioning and emphasize which hemodynamic variables can be monitored when this therapy is applied.
   Recent findings
   Early and prolonged prone positioning sessions significantly decrease the mortality of patients with severe ARDS. Prone positioning increases cardiac preload and decreases right ventricular afterload in patients with ARDS under protective ventilation and maximal lung recruitment. This results in an increase in cardiac output only in patients with preload reserve, emphasizing the important role of preload in the hemodynamic effects of prone positioning. Prone positioning might also exert some effects on regional and/or local blood flows, which mainly result from the increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Because prone positioning does not produce a significant increase in intra-abdominal pressure, it does not exert deleterious effects on the microcirculation of intra-abdominal organs.
   Summary
   Prone positioning generally exerts beneficial macrocirculatory effects, which can result in increased cardiac output in patients with preload reserve without negatively altering regional circulations.

TI Low-pressure shunt 'malfunction' following lumbar puncture in children
   with shunted obstructive hydrocephalus
SO PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY
AB Most shunt malfunctions present with signs and symptoms of high intracranial pressure, and computed tomography scans demonstrate ventricular enlargement. However, several authors have described a rare 'low-pressure' hydrocephalic state in which ventricular enlargement can occur in the face of low, or even negative, intracranial pressures. We report 2 children with obstructive hydrocephalus in whom this 'low-pressure state' followed a lumbar puncture; in both children, the shunts were functioning properly despite increased ventricular size on computed tomography scans, and all symptoms resolved (and the ventricles returned to baseline) following a period of enforced recumbency without shunt revision. We hypothesize that subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid leakage through the puncture site in the lumbar theca decreases the intracranial pressures globally to a point below the opening pressures of the shunt valves. The ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, unable to be drained through either the subarachnoid space or the shunt, accumulates within the ventricular system under low pressure. One consistent feature in our 2 patients has been the postural nature of the headaches. We recommend enforced recumbency and, if necessary, a blood patch to seal the lumbar leakage. Shunt revision or prolonged external ventricular drainage appears to be unnecessary in these patients. Finally, neurosurgeons should be aware of this potential complication.

TI Improving the performance of salinity gradient power generation by a
   negative pressure difference
SO JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
AB Although salinity gradient power is a promising renemable energy source, its performance is limited by ion concentration polarization. We show that this problem can be alliviated effectively by applying a pressure gradient, the direction of which is opposite to the concentration gradient. The mechanisms involved are discussed in detail. Background: Ion concentration polarization (ICP) can lower appreciably the effective concentration gradient across a nanopore, thereby reducing significantly the power generated in salinity gradient power harvesting. Methods: Attempting to alleviate ICP, we propose applying a negative pressure difference across the nanopore. Significant findings: Due to the enhancement in nanopore selectivity, the power generated can be improved appreciably. For example, at a surface charge density of -60 mC/m2, the maximum power can be raised up to ca. 167% when a pressure difference of -6 bar is applied. We show, for the first time, that applying a negative pressure difference is indeed effective. (c) 2022 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Long-Term Outcomes of Stenting for Pulsatile Tinnitus Caused by Cerebral
   Venous Sinus Stenosis
SO OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY
AB ObjectiveTo investigate the long-term outcomes of stenting for isolated pulsatile tinnitus (PT) caused by cerebral venous sinus stenosis.Study DesignRetrospective study.SettingThe First Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital.PatientsPatients diagnosed to have isolated PT secondary to cerebral venous sinus stenosis at our institution between December 2009 and March 2023.InterventionCerebral venous sinus stenting.Main Outcome Measure(s)Morphological features of the cerebral venous sinus, endovascular technique, and clinical outcomes.ResultsThe study included 80 patients with a mean age of 39.4 +/- 9.6 years and an average body mass index of 23.9 kg/m. The mean age at symptom onset was 35.1 +/- 8.7 years. Seventy-five of the patients (93.8%) were women. PT was the primary symptom. All patients reported feeling anxious because PT had severely affected their day-to-day lives. The PT was right-sided in 52 cases (65%). All procedures were technically successful. The mean trans-stenotic pressure gradient decreased from 4.3 +/- 3.3 mm Hg before stenting to 0.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg after stent placement. Twenty-one patients (26.3%) experienced poststenting headache. The mean follow-up duration was 80.5 +/- 46.3 months, with 26 patients followed for over 120 months. PT resolved in all cases after stenting, and there were no recurrences. Follow-up radiographic examination of 23 patients (28.8%) at a mean of 71.2 +/- 43.1 months identified only one case of restenosis.ConclusionsLong-term follow-up of these patients confirmed the efficacy and safety of stenting for isolated venous sinus stenosis-related PT.

TI Abdominal compartment syndrome:: avoidance and treatment
SO CHIRURG
AB Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above 20 mmHg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria. in primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis, ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma. Secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery. The effects are decreased cardiac output, pulmonary atelectasis, oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion. Effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure. Normal values are between 0 and 7 cm H2O, after elective laparotomies 5-12 cm H2O. Above 25 cm H2O they are definitely pathological. For the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended. Between 1988 and 1999 we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in 377 patients. In 16% of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of 31 +/- 4 cm H2O preoperatively, which could be lowered to 17 +/- 4 cm H2O by laparostomy. An early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in 18% of the cases. Conclusions: The abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems. The temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in ail circumstances.

   after traumatic brain injury

   American-Association-for-the-Surgery-of-Trauma
CY SEP 11-13, 2004

AB Introduction: Increases in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) can cause increases in intracranial pressure (ICP). Recently, we noticed that abdominal fascial release could be useful in treating intracranial hypertension (ICH) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We added this as an option in our treatment of TBI.
   Methods: In our institution, ICH is treated with an algorithm using osmolar therapy, CSF drainage and barbiturates. Patients with refractory ICH have routine measurement of IAP. If elevated, consideration is given to decompressive laparotomy. We retrospectively reviewed all patients admitted from January 2000 through July 2003 who had abdominal decompression to treat refractory ICH.
   Results: From 1/00 to 7/03, 17 patients underwent decompressive laparotomy for intractable ICH. Thirteen male and 4 females all sustained blunt injury. All had failed maximal therapy including 14 who had had decompressive craniectomy. Mean ICP was 30 +/- 8.1 mm Hg (range 20-40 mm Hg) before decompression. No patients had evidence of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Before decompression mean IAP was 27.5 (+/- 5.2) mmHg (range 21-35 mm Hg). After abdominal decompression ICP dropped precipitously by at least 10 mm Hg to a mean of 17.5 (+/- 3.2) mmHg (range 10-25 mm Hg). In 6 patients the decrease in ICP was transient. All died. The remaining 11 had sustained decreases in ICP. All survived, made neurologic recovery and were discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
   Conclusion: Decompressive laparotomy can be a useful adjunct in the treatment of ICH failing maximal therapy following TBI. More work will need to be done to precise the exact indications for this therapy.

TI Modelling idiopathic intracranial hypertension in rats: contributions of
   high fat diet and testosterone to intracranial pressure and
   cerebrospinal fluid production
SO FLUIDS AND BARRIERS OF THE CNS
AB BackgroundIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP), impaired vision, and headache. Most cases of IIH occur in obese women of childbearing age, though age, BMI, and female sex do not encompass all aspects of IIH pathophysiology. Systemic metabolic dysregulation has been identified in IIH with a profile of androgen excess. However, the mechanistic coupling between obesity/hormonal perturbations and cerebrospinal fluid dynamics remains unresolved.MethodsFemale Wistar rats were either fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 21 weeks or exposed to adjuvant testosterone treatment for 28 days to recapitulate IIH causal drivers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood testosterone levels were determined with mass spectrometry, ICP and CSF dynamics with in vivo experimentation, and the choroid plexus function revealed with transcriptomics and ex vivo isotope-based flux assays.ResultsHFD-fed rats presented with increased ICP (65%), which was accompanied by increased CSF outflow resistance (50%) without altered CSF secretion rate or choroid plexus gene expression. Chronic adjuvant testosterone treatment of lean rats caused elevated ICP (55%) and CSF secretion rate (85%), in association with increased activity of the choroid plexus Na+,K+,2Cl(-) cotransporter, NKCC1.ConclusionsHFD-induced ICP elevation in experimental rats occurred with decreased CSF drainage capacity. Adjuvant testosterone, mimicking the androgen excess observed in female IIH patients, elevated the CSF secretion rate and thus ICP. Obesity-induced androgen dysregulation may thus contribute to the disease mechanism of IIH.

TI Simple depressed skull fracture causing sagittal sinus stenosis and
   increased intracranial pressure: case report and review of the
   literature
SO SURGICAL NEUROLOGY
AB The surgical management of depressed skull fractures is determined in part by whether a fracture is open or closed. Open fractures are usually elevated surgically, but closed fractures are most often treated nonoperatively, and the only 2 indications commonly described for operative treatment of closed fractures are hematoma evacuation and correction of cosmetic deformity. There is another indication, however, that is occasionally encountered when a depressed skull fracture injures a venous sinus. This injury can result in venous sinus stenosis, leading to venous hypertension and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). A case is presented of closed depressed fracture of the midline skull, causing compressive stenosis of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), venous hypertension, and encephalopathy. The fracture was surgically elevated to relieve the compression of the SSS and the encephalopathy resolved. The clinical identification, the imaging, and the risks and benefits of operative repair of this condition are reviewed. Increased ICP secondary to venous sinus injury is not commonly described in association with closed depressed skull fractures, but should always be considered in patients with the appropriate clinical findings when a fracture overlies a venous sinus, even in the absence of a hematoma.

SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB The study was performed on 81 cats with 3 models of experimental brain edema: sudden decompression, surgical wound and cold injury. During the experiments blood pressure, central venous pressure and intracranial pressure were recorded. The blood-brain-barrier was tested with Evans blue solution. The gray and white matter tissue was sampled at the end of the experiment, and the water content and Na and K concentrations were determined. The animals with the same experimental model were divided into 3 groups: untreated, treated with the vasoprotective agents, and treated with the protease inhibitor Trasylol. In the sudden decompression model after balloon deflation, white matter hemorrhages and edema development were found in gray matter and basal nuclei. In animals treated with the vasoprotective drugs, hemorrhages were not observed, and edematous changes were less pronounced. The Trasylol effect on edema development was not significant in this model. In the surgical wound model, edematous changes were observed after 24 h following the lesion. Edema occurred in the white matter, as in the animals with cold lesions. In both models.sbd.surgical wound and cold lesion.sbd.the beneficial effect of Trasylol was shown, while the effect of Aescorin was less evident. The results obtained seemed to testify to the usefulness of both Trasylol and vasoprotective drugs in the prevention and treatment of brain edema in neurosurgical patients.

TI Dynamic Association between Intraocular Pressure and Spontaneous
   Pulsations of Retinal Veins
SO CURRENT EYE RESEARCH
AB Purpose: The amplitude of spontaneous retinal venous pulsations (SRVP) is known to be affected by intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal venous pressure, and intracranial pressure (ICP). This study characterized SRVPs adjacent to the disc and quantified changes in the amplitude of these pulsations during IOP manipulation in normal subjects.
   Methods: The study included 12 subjects (40 +/- 15, 4 females, 8 males). Baseline IOP (range 10-25 mmHg) was measured and SRVP recorded using the dynamic retinal vessel analyzer (DVA). IOP was lowered using aproclonidine 0.5% and measured every 15 min, followed by dynamic recording of SRVP. Two subjects were also tested with timolol 0.5%, and three were treated with a placebo drop. Mean amplitude of SRVP was determined within each sample at the same site. Blood pressure and heart rate were tracked continuously.
   Results: Amplitude of SRVP decreased in all subjects with reduction of IOP with aproclonidine and timolol. Mean SRVP amplitude was 8.5 +/- 6 mu m at baseline and reduced to 2.5 +/- 1.8 mu m after 45 min (p < 0.0001). IOP fell from 14.4 +/- 2.6 mmHg to 10.2 +/- 2.9 mmHg over the same period (p < 0.001). Venous diameter, blood pressure, and heart rate did not change significantly from the baseline. Analysis of waveforms showed a slight phase shift only (150 +/- 78.5 ms, p = 0.93) between disc veins and adjacent retinal vein.
   Conclusion: SRVPs in the peripapillary retina have similar waveform characteristics to those at the disc. SRVP amplitudes are reduced by manipulation of IOP downwards with pharmacological intervention. The relationship was consistent in all individuals tested for two classes of drugs and was independent of BP or heart rate changes.

TI High Intracranial Pressure Induced Injury in the Healthy Rat Brain
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objectives: We recently showed that increased intracranial pressure to 50 mm Hg in the healthy rat brain results in microvascular shunt flow characterized by tissue hypoxia, edema, and increased blood-brain barrier permeability. We now determined whether increased intracranial pressure results in neuronal injury by Fluoro-Jade stain and whether changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen suggest nonnutritive microvascular shunt flow.
   Design: Intracranial pressure was elevated by a reservoir of artificial cerebrospinal fluid connected to the cisterna magna. Arterial blood gases, cerebral arterial-venous oxygen content difference, and cerebral blood flow by MRI were measured. Fluoro-Jade stain neurons were counted in histologic sections of the right and left dorsal and lateral cortices and hippocampus.
   Setting: University laboratory.
   Subjects: Male Sprague Dawley rats.
   Interventions: Arterial pressure support if needed by IV dopamine infusion and base deficit corrected by sodium bicarbonate.
   Measurements and Main Results: Fluoro-Jade stain neurons increased 2.5- and 5.5-fold at intracranial pressures of 30 and 50 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressures of 57 +/- 4 (mean +/- sem) and 47 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively (p < 0.001) (highest in the right and left cortices). Voxel frequency histograms of cerebral blood flow showed a pattern consistent with microvascular shunt flow by dispersion to higher cerebral blood flow at high intracranial pressure and decreased cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen.
   Conclusions: High intracranial pressure likely caused neuronal injury because of a transition from normal capillary flow to nonnutritive microvascular shunt flow resulting in tissue hypoxia and edema, and it is manifest by a reduction in the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen.

TI Pathogenesis of hydrocephalus in achondroplastic dwarfs: a review and
   presentation of a case followed for 22 years
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Object The purpose of this work is to review the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of hydrocephalus in patients with achondroplasia as a guide to its management throughout life.
   Methods A review of the literature related to neurosurgical issues in achondroplasia with specific focus on cerebrospinal fluid physics, clinical management, and outcome of affected individuals. Issues involved in this review are highlighted by a case report of a patient shunted for achondroplasia first shunted in infancy and followed for 22 years. Each of the management issues is explored with respect to this patient.
   Findings Head circumferences in achondroplasia are abnormally large in this condition usually caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid in the cortical subarachnoid space. Increase in ventricular size (hydrocephalus) is not rare but should not be treated unless rapidly progressive or symptomatic. The underlying cause of the abnormalities of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics relates to abnormal venous drainage at the skull base. Patients shunted in infancy for hydrocephalus usually remain dependent on the shunt for life, and crises of high intracranial pressure may occur with no distention of the ventricles.
   Conclusions In infants with achondroplasia, large heads and enlarged ventricles without symptoms should be watched initially for progression. If hydrocephalus progresses or if symptoms of intracranial hypertension occur, endoscopic third ventriculostomy can be tried. If shunt is necessary, it should have a high opening pressure and a device to retard siphoning. In the case of recurrent ventricular catheter blockage, it may be necessary to create a communication between the ventricles and the cortical subarachnoid space.

TI Abdominal compartment syndrome
SO SURGERY TODAY
AB Compartment syndrome is a pathophysiological term, comprising a variety of tissues and organ alterations, due to a higher than normal pressure in an anatomically detached space (compartment). In the human body, areas denoted as compartments include the orbital globe, the sub and epidural space, the abdomen, pleura, pericardium, and others. Compartment syndrome was described initially in limbs. Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined as an intra-abdominal pressure above 20 mHg with evidence of organ failure. Abdominal compartment syndrome develops when the intra-abdominal pressure rapidly reaches certain pathological values, within several hours (intra-abdominal hypertension is observed), and lasts for 6 or more hours. The key to recognizing abdominal compartment syndrome is the demonstration of elevated intra-abdominal pressure which is performed most often via the urinary bladder, and it is considered to be the "gold standard." Multiorgan failure includes damage to the cardiac, pulmonary, renal, neurological, gastrointestinal, abdominal wall, and ophthalmic systems. The gut is the most sensitive to intra-abdominal hypertension, and it develops evidence of end-organ damage before alterations are observed in other systems. The surgical decompression of the abdomen remains the treatment of choice of abdominal compartment syndrome; this usually improves the organ changes, and is followed by one of the temporary abdominal closure techniques in order to prevent secondary intra-abdominal hypertension.

TI Sudden onset of complete ophthalmoplegia and blindness after resection
   of large frontal convexity meningioma: Case report
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY NEUROSURGERY-ADVANCED TECHNIQUES AND CASE MANAGEMENT
AB Background: Meningiomas are the most common benign intracranial tumors. Standard treatment of symptomatic meningiomas is microsurgical resection. Surgically, convexity meningiomas are simple to remove with low complication rate. This paper describes a rare and unexpected postoperative complication - orbital compartment syndrome, including blindness after convexity meningioma resection. We believe it to be caused by unintended interruption of atypical venous outflow route from the orbit which was formed due to meningioma presence.Case Description: We present the case of a 53-year-old woman with a history of approximately 10 years of cognitive impairment and worsening prefrontal syndrome. MRI scan revealed right-sided frontal convexity meningioma (7x6x6.5 cm) with significant expansive behaviour. The patient underwent microsurgical resection with no intraoperative complications. In the immediate postoperative period, there was a rapid development of orbital compartment syndrome: complete ophthalmoplegia, vision loss, periorbital edema, exophthalmos, and chemosis.Conclusions: Large frontal convexity meningiomas, long term clinically silent, can cause chronically increased intracranial pressure which may lead to the formation of alternative routes for venous drainage from the orbit. If such created veins run through diploe of cranium above the meningioma, they might be interrupted during the craniotomy, and this may result in orbital compartment syndrome. Awareness of this rare complication may help to avoid it, since treatment options are limited.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension VISION (venous intervention versus
   shunting in IIH for optic nerve disc swelling) trial: patient
   perspective questionnaire
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Introduction: Headaches, visual problems and tinnitus are symptoms of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) which resolve with reduction of CSF pressure. Impaired cranial venous outflow has been implicated in the pathogenesis and there is evidence of good treatment results in IIH using venous sinus stenting. We are currently initiating a multi-centre randomised controlled trial, the VISION study (Venous Intervention versus Shunting in IIH for Optic Disc Swelling) comparing radiological (venous sinus stenting) to surgical intervention (CSF shunting). As part of the preparations for VISION we made a basic questionnaire available to members of the website IIH UK (). Methods: 10-point questionnaire pertaining to IIH diagnosis, symptoms and management using . Results: 250 questionnaires were returned. 95.6% of respondents were female, mostly <= 40 years of age. 70% were diagnosed in the last 5 years, but only 35% were diagnosed less than a year after onset of symptoms. 59.4% of patients had not undergone any radiological/surgical intervention, 34.9% had had CSF diversion, 3.6% venous stenting and 2.0% had stent plus shunt. 16.8% indicated their lives were most affected by tinnitus and 18.1% by visual problems, but 49.6% said they were most affected by their headaches. 81% of patients indicated they would be happy to participate in a randomised trial comparing the two treatment options of venous stenting and CSF shunting. Conclusion: IIH patients want to be actively involved in their treatment and are favourably disposed towards clinical research. Variation exists in treatment modalities offered. There are individual differences regarding impact of symptoms.

TI Endovascular treatment of intracranial venous sinus stenosis in
   intracranial hypertension: three case reports and a discussion of the
   literature
SO REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA
AB Introduction. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is an entity with an incidence of approximately 1.2: 100,000 inhabitants/year. It affects in a greater proportion obese women and women of childbearing age. Headache is the most characteristic symptom, followed by visual disturbances. In recent years, the diagnosis of dural sinus stenosis has increased in cases of intracranial hypertension resistant to conventional treatment. For this reason, the development of endovascular therapy as a therapeutic option in selected patients is booming.
   Case reports. We present three cases of intracranial hypertension secondary to dural sinus stenosis, diagnosed and treated in our hospital. Despite the establishment of adequate diuretic treatment and the performance of invasive procedures to bypass the cerebrospinal fluid, they persisted with neurological symptoms and visual deficits. After verifying that they fulfilled the requirements described in the literature, they underwent intracranial stenting, with satisfactory results in all of them, achieving the disappearance of the headache and recovery of visual acuity.
   Conclusion. Stenting of dural sinus stenosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension is an increasingly used technique, which has presented favorable results. Studies are necessary to know its long-term impact.

TI Impact of positive end-expiratory pressure on cerebral injury patients
   with hypoxemia
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB Background: Traumatic brain injury or intracranial hemorrhage patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome need mechanical ventilation. The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in this situation remains controversial. This study explored the impact of PEEP on intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), central venous pressure (CVP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in cerebral injury patients.
   Methods: Nine cerebral injury patients with lung injury who needed mechanical ventilation and met the criteria for ICP monitoring were included in this study. Intraventricular catheters were positioned in 1 of the bilateral ventricles and connected to pressure transducers. Invasive arterial pressure and CVP were monitored continuously. Pressure control ventilation was applied during this clinical trial in a stepwise recruitment maneuver (RM) with 3 cm H2O intermittent increments and decrements of PEEP.
   Results: A total of 28 RMs were completed in 9 patients. Mean values of MAP, CVP, ICP, and CPP 5 minutes after RMs showed no significant differences compared with baseline (P > 0.05). Correlation analysis of all the mean values of MAP, CVP, ICP, and CPP showed significant correlation between MAP and CPP, PEEP and CVP, PEEP and ICP, and PEEP and CPP with all P values less than 0.05.
   Conclusion: The impact of PEEP on blood pressure, ICP, and CPP varies greatly in cerebral injury patients. Mean arterial pressure and ICP monitoring is of benefit when using PEEP in cerebral injury patients with hypoxemia. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Advances in Surgical Approaches to Dural Fistulas
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB Dural arteriovenous fistulas are abnormal connections of dural arteries to dural veins or venous sinuses originating from within the dural leaflets. They are usually located near or within the wall of a dural venous sinus that is frequently obstructed or stenosed. The dural fistula sac is contained within the dural leaflets, and drainage can be via a dural sinus or retrograde through cortical veins (leptomeningeal drainage). Dural arteriovenous fistulas can occur at any dural sinus but are found most frequently at the cavernous or transverse sinus. Leptomeningeal venous drainage can lead to venous hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage. The various treatment options include transarterial and transvenous embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery, and open surgery. Although many of the advances in dural arteriovenous fistula treatment have occurred in the endovascular arena, open microsurgical advances in the past decade have primarily been in the tools available to the surgeon. Improvements in microsurgical and skull base approaches have allowed surgeons to approach and obliterate fistulas with little or no retraction of the brain. Image-guided systems have also allowed better localization and more efficient approaches. A better understanding of the need to simply obliterate the venous drainage at the site of the fistula has eliminated the riskier resections of the past. Finally, the use of intraoperative angiography or indocyanine green videoangiography confirms the complete disconnection of fistula while the patient is still on the operating room table, preventing reoperation for residual fistulas.

SO BRAZILIAN NEUROSURGERY-ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE NEUROCIRURGIA
AB Introduction New physiopathological concepts regarding idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) recommend the endovascular treatment in refractory patients with transverse sinus stenosis.
   Objectives To assess the role of the transverse sinus stenting treatment in the symptomatology of patients with IIH.
   Method Clinically refractory patients with impaired venous drainage of the transverse sinus were submitted to cerebral angiographies. Patients with pre and poststenotic pressure gradients > 8 mmHg were submitted to endovascular treatment.
   Results Seven patients underwent cerebral angiography with manometry. Stenting was performed in six cases after pressure gradient assessment. All cases showed improvements in headache and resolution of papilledema.
   Discussion and Conclusion Although the role of endovascular therapy should be further studied, our data suggest it may improve the clinical symptoms and signs of IIH in selected patients.

AB Cerebral contusion is one of the symptoms observed when a human receives a heavy impact on the head, and considered to be caused by the negative pressure fluctuation inside a cranium. In order to know the mechanism of cerebral contusion, the impact experiment and finite element analysis of a water-filled acrylic container was carried out. In the analysis, mass and velocity of the impactor were changed, so as to keep the energy constant and intracranial pressure fluctuation inside the container was obtained. The frequency analyses were performed for the pressure fluctuations. It was shown that the higher frequency was excited and the negative pressure occurred at the impact side when the force duration was short, and consequently coup contusion was caused. 11 autopsied cases which had in-depth data were reconstructed by using finite element model of a human head. The autopsy reports included the data of the impact object, impact region, skull fracture region and lesion area of a brain. In analysis, the impact velocity was estimated so that the negative pressure could occur only at the lesion area of a brain. As a result of analysis, the force duration was short when the impact object was light weight with high velocity, the negative pressure occurred at the impact side and the positive pressure occurred at the opposite side of impact, and consequently coup contusion was obtained, the force duration was long when the impact object was heavy weight with low velocity, the positive pressure occurred at the impact side and the negative pressure occurred at the opposite side of impact, and consequently contrecoup contusion was obtained.

TI Interventional and surgical management of internal jugular venous
   stenosis: a narrative review
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background A small subset of patients with presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension are found to have isolated internal jugular vein stenosis (IJVS). Objective To review the current interventions used in patients who present with intracranial hypertension secondary to IJVS. Methods In December 2020, we performed a literature search on Pubmed/Medline and Scopus databases for original articles studying surgical and endovascular interventions used for intracranial hypertension in the setting of internal jugular vein stenosis. No date, patient population, or study type was excluded. Results All studies that included at least one case in which a surgical or endovascular intervention was used to treat IJVS were included. Selection criteria for patients varied, most commonly defined by identification of compression of the internal jugular vein. The 17 studies included in this review ranged from case reports to large single-center cohort studies. The most used surgical intervention was styloidectomy. Styloidectomy had an overall better outcome success rate (79%) than angioplasty/stenting (66%). No complications were recorded in any of the surgical cases analyzed. Outcome measures varied, but all studies recorded clinical symptoms of the patients. Conclusion Few current large cohort studies analyze surgical and endovascular interventions for patients with IJVS. Notably, the most common intervention is styloidectomy, followed by internal jugular vein stenting. By understanding the trends and experience of interventionalists and surgeons, more focused and larger studies can be performed to determine effective strategies with the best clinical outcomes.

TI Effect of Nightly Lower Body Negative Pressure on Choroid Engorgement in
   a Model of Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome A Randomized
   Crossover Trial
SO JAMA OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB IMPORTANCE Astronauts returning from long-duration spaceflight experience ocular remodeling related to cephalad fluid shifts induced by microgravity. It is hypothesized that the absence of diurnal reductions in intracranial pressure in microgravity creates a low but persistent pressure gradient at the posterior aspect of the eye, which results in ocular remodeling and space-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) over many months.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether partial reintroduction of footward fluid shifts during simulated microgravity via lower body negative pressure (LBNP) during sleep attenuates choroid engorgement, an early marker of ocular remodeling related to SANS.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between May 2019 and February 2020, participants with no major cardiovascular, kidney, or ophthalmic disease completed 3 days of supine (0 degrees) bed rest with and 3 days without 8 hours of nightly LBNP in a randomized, crossover design. This single-center investigation took place at the UT Southwestern Medical Center. All analyses were conducted blinded to condition and time point.
   INTERVENTIONS Eight hours of nightly LBNP (-20 mm Hg) vs no LBNP.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the change in choroid area and volume after 3 days of bed rest measured by optical coherence tomography.
   RESULTS Of 10 participants, 5 were female, the mean (SD) age was 29 (9) years, and the age range was 18 to 55 years. Central venous pressure increased from the seated to supine position (mean [SD], seated: -2.3 [2.0] vs supine: 6.9 [2.0] mm Hg; P < .001), leading to choroid engorgement over 3 days of bed rest (Delta area: +0.09 mm(2) [95% CI, 0.04-0.13]; P = .001; Delta volume: +0.37 mm(3) [95% CI, 0.19-0.55]; P = .001). Nightly LBNP caused a sustained reduction in supine central venous pressure (mean [SD], 5.7 [2.2] mm Hg to 1.2 [1.4 mm Hg]; P < .001) and attenuated the increase in choroid area (74%) (Delta: 0.02 mm(2) [95% -0.02 to 0.06]; P = .01) and volume (53%) (Delta: 0.17 mm(3) [95% CI, 0.01-0.34]; P = .05) compared with control.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Nightly LBNP reinstated a footward fluid shift and mitigated the increase in choroid area and volume. LBNP during sleep may be an effective countermeasure for ocular remodeling and SANS during long-duration space missions.

AB Monitoring of severely head-injured patients is essential to optimize cerebral haemodynamics and thus to limit intracranial hypertension and to prevent the occurrence of secondary systemic cerebral injuries. It includes continuous measurement of intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure and venous jugular oxygen saturation. Assessment of circulatory velocity in the arteries of the polygon of Willis allows identification of intracranial hypertension, and later, a vasospasm in case of subarachnoid haemorrage. Near infrared spectroscopy is an indirect indicator of cerebral oxygenation. This technique has not yet been validated. Direct tissue measurement of cerebral oxygen content is the most recently developed monitoring tool. Its clinical range of application has still to be specified. These basic monitoring techniques are a standard. They are essential for an undelayed and efficient treatment of complications occurring in head trauma patients.

TI Case report: Simultaneous measurement of intracranial pressure and

   spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome. Spontaneous intracranial
   hypotension or spontaneous intraspinal hypovolume?
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Objectives Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is frequently complicated by subacute subdural hematoma (SDH) and more rarely by bilateral thalamic ischemia. Here, we report a case of SIH-related SDH treated with three epidural patches (EPs), with follow-up of the intracranial pressure and lumbar intrathecal pressure.Methods A 46-year-old man presented bilateral thalamic ischemia, then a growing SDH. After failure of urgent surgical evacuation, he underwent three saline EPs, two dynamic myelography examinations and one digital subtraction angiography-phlebography examination. However, because of no dural tear and no obstacle to the venous drainage of the vein of Galen, no therapeutic procedure was available, and the patient died.Results The case exhibited a progressive increase in the transmission of lumbar intrathecal pressure to intracranial pressure during the three EPs. The EPs may have successfully treated the SIH, but the patient did not recover consciousness because of irreversible damage to both thalami.Conclusion Clinicians should be aware of the bilateral thalamic ischemia picture that may be the presenting sign of SIH. Moreover, the key problem in the pathophysiology of SIH seems to be intraspinal and intracranial volumes rather than pressures. Therefore, intracranial hypotension syndrome might actually be an intraspinal hypovolume syndrome.

TI Dural venous sinus stenting in the treatment of idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension: A systematic review and critique of literature
SO SURVEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is increased intracranial pressure without a known cause. Dural venous sinus stenting (DVSS) is a relatively new intervention for treatment of IIH refractory to medical therapy and lifestyle modifications. In this review, we outline various hypotheses of IIH pathogenesis and describe the role of venous sinus stenosis and the technical details of DVSS. We also present a summary and critique of the available evidence describing the outcomes of DVSS in IIH and review the evidence-based guidelines for this procedure. We conclude that, although many studies have shown generally favorable outcomes of DVSS in patients with IIH, most have serious limitations, the most common one being paucity of pre-and postprocedure ophthalmological data. Thus, there is not enough available evidence to conclude whether DVSS is an effective procedure for treatment of IIH. We also present the most commonly used indications for DVSS as described in the literature and stress the importance of neuro-ophthalmological assessment before and after the procedure to monitor response and potential complications.

TI Anomalous venous drainage preventing safe posterior fossa decompression
   in patients with Chiari malformation Type I and multisutural
   craniosynostosis - Report of two cases and review of the literature
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB The authors report on two children in whom an anomalous posterior fossa venous drainage pattern prevented safe posterior fossa decompression. Both patients had Chiari malformation Type I, multisutural craniosynostosis, and crowded posterior fossa structures. Both patients had been treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts for hydrocephalus. Pfeiffer syndrome had been diagnosed in one of the patients, and the other was suspected to have osteogenesis imperfecta. Although both patients were believed to have symptoms resulting from brainstem compression, posterior fossa decompression was not offered due to profound venous anomalies noted on imaging studies that greatly increased the expected risks associated with surgery. These cases are presented to alert neurosurgeons to carefully evaluate the posterior fossa venous anatomy prior to considering posterior fossa decompression with or without occipitocervical fusion or calvarial vault remodeling procedures in patients with multisutural craniosynostosis.

TI Endovascular Treatment for Venous Sinus Stenosis in Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension: An Observational Study of Clinical
   Indications, Surgical Technique, and Long-Term Outcomes
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by increased intracranial pressure. IIH causes significant morbidity marked by incapacitating headaches and visual disturbances. This study investigated the long-term outcomes of venous sinus stenting in a large group of patients with IIH.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients at our institution who underwent venous sinus stenting for IIH over 6 years (July 1, 2012-June 30, 2018). A particular focus was dedicated to collecting demographic, clinical, radiologic, and outcomes data. All patients had failed medical management.
   RESULTS: Of the 110 patients evaluated for IIH, 42 underwent venous sinus stenting, with a mean follow-up of 25.6 months (range, 8.7-60.7 months). The mean age was 32 years (range, 15-52 years), 38 (90%) were women, and the mean body mass index was 35.6 kg/m(2) (range, 18.6-47.5 kg/m(2)). Prior to the stenting procedure, all patients had headaches, visual disturbances, and papilledema. Of the 39 patients who had an ophthalmologic evaluation poststenting, 29 (74%) had resolution of their papilledema. Eighteen patients (43%) had complete resolution of their headaches after the stenting procedure, whereas 22 patients (52%) remained under a neurologist's care for chronic migraine and other types of headaches. Two patients underwent a restenting procedure for disease progression, and 1 patient experienced an in-stent thrombosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary approach involving neurosurgeons, ophthalmologists, radiologists, and neurologists is integral in the management of patients with IIH to prevent the complications of papilledema. Venous sinus stenting offers a safe and effective means of treating IIH.

TI Inspiratory resistance as a potential treatment for orthostatic
   intolerance and hemorrhagic shock
SO AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Loss of consciousness due to central hypovolemia can occur clue to sudden cardiovascular decompensation in normal individuals or hypovolemic shock in Wounded patients. A variety of devices have been developed to sustain perfusion to the brain including anti-G suits worn by pilots and returning astronauts and applied to patients as "shock trousers." However, all countermeasures developed to date suffer from problems that limit their utility in the field. An "impedance threshold device" (ITD) has recently been developed that acutely increases central blood volume by forcing the thoracic muscles to develop increased negative pressure, thus drawing venous blood from extrathoracic cavities into the heart and lungs. We review here a series of experiments that demonstrate the application of the ITD to a variety of experimental conditions, including its use to: 1) increase heart rate, stroke volume, and arterial BP in normovolemia and hypovolemia; 2) increase cerebral blood flow velocity; 3) reset cardiac baroreflex function to a higher operating range for BP; 4) lower intracranial pressure; and 5) reduce orthostatic symptoms. In this brief review, we present evidence which supports further consideration of using inspiratory resistance as a countermeasure against circulatory collapse associated with orthostatic instability and hemorrhagic shock.

TI Cerebrovascular disease in pregnancy and puerperium: perspectives from
   neuroradiologists
SO QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB Pregnancy-related cerebrovascular disease is a serious complication of pregnancy and puerperium. The etiology and pathological mechanisms of cerebrovascular disease are complex, involving changes in the cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems. Vascular risk factors during pregnancy and puerperium may cause vasospasm and endothelial cell damage leading to cerebral ischemia, hemorrhage, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Arterial or venous obstruction may damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and impede venous return, resulting in cerebral edema, hemorrhage, and intracranial hypertension. Pregnancy with hypercoagulability may threaten the lives of both the mother and the developing fetus.

TI Endovascular balloon angioplasty for treatment of posttraumatic venous
   sinus thrombosis Case report
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB In severe cases, posttraumatic cerebral sinus thrombosis can result in venous congestion and persistent intracranial hypertension refractory to both conventional medical therapy and surgical decompression. The authors report a unique case of a patient Successfully treated with endovascular mechanical thrombolysis using balloon angioplasty for clinically significant posttraumatic venous sinus thrombosis and review the reported treatments for cerebral venous sinus occlusive disease.
   This 18-year-old man Suffered severe closed head injury from a fall while skateboarding. A head CT scan demonstrated basilar skull fractures involving the left jugular foramen. A CT angiogram revealed thrombosis of the left transverse sinus and occlusion of the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein. Despite treatment with anticoagulation therapy and decompressive hemi- and suboccipital craniectomies, intracranial hypertension remained refractory. Serial angiography demonstrated progressive sinus Occlusion. Endovascular balloon thrombolysis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses resulted in immediate reduction of intracranial pressures and improved sinus patency. Intracranial pressure measurements remained low after the procedure. The patient eventually improved neurologically, was able to follow commands and walk, and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further recovery.
   Anticoagulation therapy, Surgical decompression, and endovascular thrombolysis have been reported as treatment modalities for clinically significant posttraumatic venous sinus thrombosis. In this case, endovascular mechanical thrombolysis with balloon angioplasty resulted in resolution of thrombus and successful immediate reduction of intracranial pressure. This treatment may be considered in patients with critically elevated intracranial pressure from posttraumatic venous sinus occlusion refractory to other treatment measures.

TI Report of Dramatic Improvement after a Lumboperitoneal Shunt Procedure
   in a Case of Anticoagulation Therapy-Resistant Cerebral Venous
   Thrombosis
SO JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
AB Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), which typically progresses from either acute or subacute onset, presents with symptoms related to intracranial hypertension (e.g., headache and papilledema) and brain parenchymal lesions (e.g., aphasia and hemiplegia). Anticoagulation therapy is generally accepted as a treatment for CVT and often leads to good clinical outcomes. However, we experienced a case of CVT with an uncommon clinical course. The patient was a 63-year-old man who presented with headache, papilledema, visual loss, and diplopia; his condition gradually deteriorated, and he was diagnosed with CVT via cerebral angiography. The sinus thrombus was extensive and resistant to anticoagulation therapy, and lumbar puncture revealed a progressive increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. We performed a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt procedure, which yielded marked improvement in the symptoms. The main mechanism of neurological dysfunction in CVT is venous outflow obstruction caused by venous thrombus, which results in brain edema, and/or venous infarction, which induces focal neurological signs. Another mechanism is impaired CSF absorption in the thrombosed sinuses, resulting in intracranial hypertension. We speculated that the latter mechanism strongly influenced our case, thus explaining the uncommon clinical course and effectiveness of the LP shunt procedure. Although LP shunting is not a common treatment for CVT, this case report could indicate the usefulness of this procedure for CVT with chronic progression and resistance to anticoagulation therapy.

AB Hydrostatic pressure is a force applied by a liquid on the surface of an immersed body. Inside the circulatory system it depends on the weight of the blood column between the heart and a given level. In neurosurgical patients, the hydrostatic pressure plays an important role in cerebral perfusion, transcapillary fluid movements and venous air embolism. The mean arterial pressure (PaBAR), the CSF pressure (CSFP) and the pressure in the jugular vein (JVP) are the hydrostatic determiners of the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The hydrostatic pressure gradient associated with head raising decreases PaBAR, cerebral venous pressure and JVP, decreases or increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and decreases CPP. The consequences of the resulting hypoperfusion depend on the status of autoregulation. When the skull is open, the pressure under the cerebral retractors determines the transmural pressure and cerebral perfusion. The transcapillary fluid movements depend on a permeability coefficient, a hydrostatic pressure gradient and an osmotic pressure gradient. In case of a rupture of blood brain barrier (BBB), the increase of PaBAR and the decrease of ICP (craniotomies) favour the development of vasogenic oedema. When the PaBAR stands higher than the upper limit of autoregulation, the hydrostatic capillary pressure increases. It results in a vasodilation, an increase of cerebral blood flow and oedema, the lesion of BBB being initiated by an increase of the amount and the activity of the pinocytotic vesicles in endothelial cells. The syndrome of BBB rupture at a normal CPP is the consequence of an increase in hydrostatic pressure in the dilated capillary territory and can make more difficult the surgical treatment of arterio-venous malformations. Finally, the occurrence of venous air embolism depends on a negative pressure gradient between the head and the right heart, favouring the penetration of air through a venous opening. This gradient is maximal in the conventional sitting position, however air embolism has been described in other neurosurgical postures. The compression of the jugular veins increases the cerebral venous pressure above the atmospheric pressure and has therefore been advocated for decreasing the risk of venous air embolism.

TI A comparison of non-invasive versus invasive measures of intracranial
   pressure in hypoxic ischaemic brain injury after cardiac arrest
SO RESUSCITATION
AB Aim: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in hypoxic ischaemic brain injury (HIBI) can cause secondary ischaemic brain injury and culminate in brain death. Invasive ICP monitoring is limited by associated risks in HIBI patients. We sought to evaluate the agreement between invasive ICP measurements and non-invasive estimators of ICP (nICP) in HIBI patients.
   Methods: Eligible consecutive adult (age >18) cardiac arrest patients with HIBI were included as part of a single centre prospective interventional study. Invasive ICP monitoring and nICP measurements were undertaken using: a) transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD), b) optic nerve sheet diameter ultrasound (ONSD) and c) jugular venous bulb pressure (JVP). Multiple measurements applied in linear mixed-effects models were considered to obtain the correlation coefficient between ICP and nICP as well as their predictive abilities to detect intracranial hypertension (ICP >= 20 mm Hg).
   Results: Eleven patients were included (median age of 47 [range 20-71], 8 males and 3 females). There was a linear relationship between ICP and nICP with ONSD (R=0.53 [p 0.0001]), JVP (R = 0.38 [p 0.001]) and TCD =0.30 [p 0.01]). The ability to predict intracranial hypertension was highest for ONSD and TCD (area under the receiver operating curve (AUC)= 0.96 [95% CI: 0.90-1.00] and AUC =0.91 [95% CI: 0.83-1.00], respectively). JVP presented the weakest prediction ability (AUG = 0.75 [95% CI: 0.56-0.94]).
   Conclusions: ONSD and TCD methods demonstrated agreement with invasively-monitored ICP, suggesting their potential roles in the detection of intracranial hypertension in HIBI after cardiac arrest.

TI Progressive Functional Underdrainage in Cerebrospinal Fluid
   Shunt-Dependent Women During Pregnancy: Case Report and Review of the
   Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Since the 1950s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt dependency has no longer been a contradiction to normal life, including sexuality and pregnancy in women, because of advances in the understanding of hydrocephalus and shunt technology. Although pregnancy in shunt-dependent women is rare, it causes uncertainty among treating physicians.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 34-year-old pregnant woman with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Throughout her pregnancy she experienced progressive symptoms of CSF underdrainage without any signs of other pregnancy-related complications. After the delivery of a healthy infant, shunt resistance had to be readjusted to prepregnancy levels. A comprehensive review of the literature reports in English, listed in PubMed, is provided.
   CONCLUSIONS: Conservative treatment of pregnancy-related functional underdrainage by consecutive valve pressure adjustment is possible, easy, and safe.

TI Traumatic open depressed cranial fracture causing occlusion of posterior
   superior sagittal sinus Case report
SO MEDICINE
AB Rationale: The superior sagittal sinus (SSS) is the major dural sinuses that receive a considerable amount of venous drainage. Interruption of its posterior third has been suggested to cause intracranial hypertension and lead to potentially fatal consequences.
   Patient concerns: We presented a 22-year-old man with a severe headache and scalp bleeding after a head chop wound. Physical examination identified a 20-cm straight laceration in his parietooccipital scalp. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a depressed cranial fracture (DCF) in the left parietooccipital bone, a fracture line across the midline to the right side, and penetrations of bone fragments into the brain parenchyma.
   Diagnoses: Traumatic open DCF in left parietooccipital bone.
   Interventions: An emergent left parietooccipital craniotomy, followed by cranioplasty to restore the depressed bone flap, was delivered to the patient. Postoperative CT confirmed successful elevation of the DCF and removal of intracerebral bone fragments. However, postoperative CT angiography (CTA) demonstrated an absence of venous flow distal to the fracture, suggesting occlusion of the posterior third of SSS. MRV revealed a persistent absence of venous flow in the posterior third of SSS with dilated cortical venous drainage. Anticoagulation treatment was initiated 3 days after surgery, and follow-up CTA and digital subtraction angiography showed gradually improved patency in the anterior and middle two-thirds of SSS.
   Outcomes: Despite occlusion of the posterior third of SSS, patient's symptoms resolved after the operation and he was discharged without complications.
   Lessons: The favorable clinical outcome after complete occlusion of the posterior third of the SSS has rarely been reported and it might be explained by our timely surgical intervention and development of compensatory cerebral collateral circulation.

TI Hemodynamic and respiratory effects of negative tracheal pressure during
   CPR in pigs
SO RESUSCITATION
AB Background: A new device, the intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR), was developed to generate continuous negative intrathoracic pressure during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and allow for intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Use of the ITPR has been shown to increase vital organ perfusion and short-term survival rates in pigs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic and blood gas effects of more prolonged (15 min) use of the ITPR during CPR in a porcine model of cardiac arrest.
   Methods: After 8 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation (VF), 16 female pigs were anaesthetized with propofol, intubated, and randomized prospectively to 15 min of either ITPR-CPR or standard (STD) CPR. Compressions were delivered at a rate of 100/min with a compression to ventilation ratio of 15:2. Ventilations were delivered with a resuscitator bag. Tracheal, aortic, right atria[, intracranial pressures (ICP), common carotid blood flow and respiratory variables were recorded continuously. Arterial and venous blood gases were collected at baseline, and after 5, 10, and 15 min of CPR. Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated as diastolic aortic pressure-right atrial pressure. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP) was calculated as mean arterial pressure (MAP)-intracranial pressure. Statistical analysis was performed with unpaired t-test and Friedman's Repeated Measures Analysis. Results: ITPR-CPR when compared to STD-CPR resulted in a significant decrease in mean decompression phase (diastolic) tracheal pressure (-9 +/- 0.6mmHg versus -3 +/- 0.3 mmHg, p < 0.001), diastolic right atria[ pressure (DRAP) (-0.1 +/- 0.2 mmHg versus 2.3 +/- 0.2 mmHg, p < 0.001) and intracranial pressure (20.8 +/- 0.6 mmHg versus 23 +/- 0.5 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.04) and a significant increase in total mean aortic pressure, coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures and end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), (p < 0.001). Common carotid artery blood flow was increased by an average of 70%, p < 0.001. ABGs showed progressive metabolic acidosis in the ITPR-CPR group, but PaCO2 remained stable at 34 mmHg for 15 min. In the STD-CPR group, pseudorespiratory alkalosis was observed with PaC02 values remaining < 20 mmHg (p < 0.001). PaO2 was not different between groups. Following 23 min of cardiac arrest (115 min of CPR) ROSC was achieved in 5/8 ITPR-CPR animals versus 2/8 STD-CPR animals p = 0.3.
   Conclusion: ITPR-CPR significantly improved hemodynamics, vital organ perfusion pressures and common carotid blood flow compared to STD-CPR in a porcine model of prolonged cardiac arrest and basic life support. The beneficial hemodynamic effects of ITPR-CPR were sustained at least 15 min without any compromise in oxygenation. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Basilar skull fracture: A risk factor for transverse/sigmoid venous
   sinus obstruction
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB In trauma practice, basilar skull fracture is an extremely common finding while transverse/sigmoid venous sinus thrombosis is generally considered quite a rare complication. During evaluation of cervical computed tomography (CT) angiography after trauma, we identified five patients in just three months with unexpected transverse/sigmoid venous sinus obstruction ipsilateral to a basilar skull fracture. This number represented a surprisingly high percentage of our neurosurgical trauma consults for the study period (31%). Three of the five patients were found to have sinus thrombosis: two with right transverse/sigmoid sinus thrombosis experienced significant neurological deficits and prolonged hospital courses even with anti-coagulation therapy; one patient with a left transverse/sigmoid sinus thrombosis had a good outcome with anti-coagulation therapy. The other two of the five patients had outflow obstruction, likely from focal epidural bleeding and extrinsic compression: one patient with partial obstruction in the right transverse-siginoid junction, due to epidural bleeding, experienced a difficult recovery; one patient with a right sigmoid sinus obstruction presented and remained asymptomatic and experienced a benign hospital course. Two of the five patients had a posterior temporal hemorrhagic area ipsilateral to the affected sinus, suggesting that this finding may have represented hemorrhagic venous infarction rather than traumatic contusion. We propose that a basilar skull fracture in the region of temporal or occipital bone should be considered as a significant risk factor for the development of transverse/sigmoid venous sinus obstruction and may be an under-recognized and treatable cause of increased intracranial pressure. Failure to detect this complication may explain, in part, unexpected clinical outcomes.

TI Normal pressure "herniation"
SO NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB Introduction: Hydrocephalus with normal intracranial pressure has rarely been reported to result in herniation.
   Methods: Case report.
   Results: A 52-year-old man became acutely comatose with extensor posturing and ventriculomegaly 17 days after experiencing a primary ventricular hemorrhage. An external ventricular drain revealed normal intracranial pressure. After 24 hours without improvement with the drain set at a level of 5 mm H2O, negative-pressure siphoning (50 mL of cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] removed) reduced ventricular size and led to dramatic clinical recovery.
   Conclusion: Normal pressure hydrocephalus can result in delayed brainstem herniation after ventricular hemorrhage. CSF siphoning in these patients can reverse the syndrome.

TI Fluid management in subarachnoid hemorrhage
SO NEUROLOGIST
AB BACKGROUND- Disturbances of water and sodium balance occur frequently after subarachnoid hemorrhage and can have a major impact on outcome. With proper intravenous fluid management, these complications are almost completely preventable.
   REVIEW SUMMARY- Hyponatremia and intravascular volume contraction occur most frequently and reflect homeostatic derangements that favor excessive free water retention and sodium loss. Hypovolemia can predispose to cerebral ischemia from vasospasm and is best prevented by administering large volumes of isotonic fluid (0.9% saline, with or without 5% albumin). Infusion rates should be titrated to maintain positive fluid balance, normal body weight, and elevated central venous pressure. Although hypervolemic therapy does not prevent hyponatremia in all patients, the severity of hyponatremia can be greatly minimized by avoiding intravenous solutions containing excess free water (e.g., D5W or 0.45% saline). Hyponatremia and hypoosmolality can be particularly detrimental in patients with cerebral edema or increased intracranial pressure and should be corrected with furosemide, mannitol, or hypertonic saline. Hypertensive hypervolemic therapy is the first line of treatment for symptomatic vasospasm and, in most cases, requires monitoring with the use of a pulmonary artery catheter. Because colloids expand intravascular volume more effectively than crystalloid, 5% albumin may be advantageous to 0.9% saline for rapid correction of ischemic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS- Abnormalities of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis after subarachnoid hemorrhage favor free water retention and sodium loss. Accordingly, proper fluid management is based on two guiding principles: maintenance of normal or increased intravascular volume using isotonic fluids, and strict avoidance of all potential sources of free water.

TI JUGULAR LIGATION DOES NOT INCREASE INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE BUT DOES
   INCREASE BIHEMISPHERIC CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW AND METABOLISM
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objectives: To answer the following questions: a) Does jugular venous ligation (simulating venovenous extracorporeal life support) alter proximal jugular venous pressure, intracranial pressure, hemispheric cerebral blood flow, or cerebral metabolism? b) Does release of ligation reverse these effects? and c) What are the comparative effects of venous ligation alone vs. venous ligation in combination with arterial ligation?
   Design: Prospective, randomized, laboratory investigation.
   Setting: Multidisciplinary laboratory setting.
   Subjects: Sixteen swine, weighing 8.1 to 12.1 kg, 3 to 4 wks of age.
   Interventions: Sixteen swine were randomly assigned to two groups, utilizing a random sequence of vessel ligation. Nine swine underwent occlusion of the right internal and external jugular veins alone (venovenous ligation) followed by release of the occlusion and then occlusion of the right common carotid artery and the right internal and external jugular veins together (venoarterial ligation). The remaining seven swine underwent venoarterial ligation, followed by release of the occlusion and then venovenous ligation. In the experimental group in which venovenous ligation was performed first, the 5, and 30-min release periods after ligation were taken to represent the effects of draining the right jugular vein during venovenous extracorporeal life support.
   Measurements and Main Results: Data were obtained at baseline, 5, and 30 mins after each ligation/release period. Intracranial pressure, right and left internal jugular pressures/flow rates, and cerebral sinus lactate concentrations were measured. Cerebral blood flow was determined using Xe-133 clearance methodology, and the cerebral metabolic rate was calculated. There were no significant differences between the ipsilateral internal jugular pressure or extracorporeal life support at 5 or 30 mins after venovenous or venoarterial ligation compared with baseline values or compared with the release of the ligation at 5 or 30 mins. There was a significant increase in right-side (44.7 +/- 2.0 vs. 38.8 +/- 2.4 mL/kg/min; p < .05) and left-side (42.9 +/- 2.3 vs. 38.7 +/- 1.9 mL/ kg/min; p < .05) cerebral blood flow 5 mins after venovenous ligation when compared with baseline values. Similarly, after venoarterial ligation, there was a significant increase in right-side (44.6 +/- 2.2 vs. 38.8 +/- 2.4 mL/ kg/min; p < .05) and left-side (43.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 38.7 +/- 1.9 mL/kg/min; p < .05) cerebral blood flow. Cerebral oxygen consumption was significantly increased after venovenous (2.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 mL/kg/min; p < .05) and venoarterial (2.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.1 +/- 0.2 mL/kg/min; p < .05) ligation at 5 mins after ligation, This increase persisted at the 30-min period and after release of ligation.
   Conclusions: Ligation of the right jugular veins alone (venovenous ligation) or jugular veins and right carotid artery (venoarterial ligation) does not increase jugular venous pressures or intracranial pressure, However, this procedure does increase cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption. These findings demonstrate that there is adequate decompression of the venous system by the cerebrovascular system and retrograde decompression during extracorporeal life support appears unwarranted.

TI Cerebral venous thrombosis: an unanticipated consequence of unilateral
   internal jugular vein ligation
SO BMJ CASE REPORTS
AB Retrograde cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare complication following internal jugular vein (IJV) ligation. The patient described in this report is a male in his 30s with locally advanced carcinoma tongue. He underwent near-total glossectomy and bilateral neck dissection. Due to heavy nodal burden, his right IJV had to be sacrificed. The patient presented with features of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) postoperatively. Magnetic resonance venogram of the brain revealed CVT involving sigmoid and transverse sinus. This case report describes a perplexing case of right-sided IJV ligation giving rise to CVT, resulting in raised ICP. Although the contralateral cerebral venous system was found to be normal, it failed to compensate for the obstructed outflow on the affected side. In this case report, we have elucidated the possible mechanism for the development of raised ICP and described the management in the light of existing evidence.

TI Combined surgical repair and venous sinus stenting for patients with
   skull base encephaloceles secondary to dural venous sinus stenosis
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB BackgroundChronically elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) seen in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can cause the development of skull base encephaloceles and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. Surgical repair and ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement are mainstays of treatment. Venous sinus stenting (VSS) is a newly accepted treatment modality. The goal of this study was thus to determine if VSS can be used to treat symptoms and prevent recurrence after surgical encephalocele repair.MethodsRetrospective chart review of patients that had surgical repair of encephaloceles followed by VSS for symptomatic stenosis with elevated pressure gradient.ResultsA total of 13 patients underwent a combined encephalocele repair and VSS. Seventy-two percent were female; 46% had headaches, 69% pulsatile tinnitus, and 92% CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea. One had seizures. Mean lumbar opening pressure was 23.3 & PLUSMN; 2.6 cm H2O; the average sagittal-to-jugular pressure gradient was 12.7 & PLUSMN; 1.8 cmH(2)O and was elevated in all patients. Four patients had middle fossa craniotomy for repair of tegmen defect (one bilateral); one had a retrosigmoid craniotomy for repair of a sigmoid plate defect. Eight had an endoscopic endonasal repair for sphenoid or cribriform plate encephalocele. There were no VSS procedural complications or complications associated with dual antiplatelet therapy. One patient had meningitis after endoscopic repair that was treated with antibiotics. One patient had recurrence of both CSF leak and venous stenosis adjacent to the stent requiring repeat repair and VSS. There was no further recurrence.ConclusionIn patients with dural sinus stenosis and encephaloceles requiring repair, VSS can be performed safely within weeks of surgery for relief of symptoms, resolution of underlying pathology, and prevention of CSF leak recurrence.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF ARTERIAL CARBON-DIOXIDE ON CEREBRAL OXYGENATION AND
   HEMODYNAMICS DURING ECMO IN NORMOXAEMIC AND HYPOXEMIC PIGLETS
SO ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB Objective. To investigate the cerebrovascular response to changes in arterial CO2 tension during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in normoxaemic and hypoxaemic piglets,
   Methods. Four groups of six anaesthetized, paralysed and mechanically ventilated piglets: group 1 - normoxaemia without ECMO, group 2 - ECMO after normoxaemia, group 3 - hypoxaemia without ECMO, and group 4 - ECMO after hypoxaemia, were exposed successively to hypercapnia and hypocapnia. Changes in cerebral concentrations of oxyhaemoglobin (cO(2)Hb), deoxyhaemoglobin (cHHb), (oxidized - reduced) cytochrome aa(3) (cCyt.aa(3)) and blood volume (CBV) were continuously measured using near infrared spectrophotometry. Heart rate, arterial O-2 saturation, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure (ICP) and left common carotid artery blood flow (LCaBF) were measured simultaneously.
   Results. Hypercapnia resulted in increased CBV, cO(2)Hb and ICP in ail groups, while cHHb was decreased. No changes in LCaBF were found. Hypocapnia resulted in decreased cO(2)Hb and increased cHHb except in group 3. LCaBF decreased in all groups except group 2. CBV decreased only in groups 2 and 4. No effect on ICP was observed in any of the groups. The other variables showed no important changes either during hypercapnia or hypocapnia. ECMO after hypoxaemia resulted in a greater response of cO(2)Hb and cHHb during hypocapnia. The effect of hypercapnia on CBV while on ECMO was greater than without ECMO.
   Conclusion. Since cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 remains intact during ECMO in piglets, it is important to keep arterial CO2 tension stable and in normal range during clinical ECMO.

AB Bedrest studies of normal subjects provide opportunities to understand physiologic responses to supine posture and inactivity.  Furthermore, head-down tilt has been a valuable procedure to investigate adaptation to microgravity and development of countermeasures to maintain the health and well-being of humans during spaceflight.  Recent bedrest experiments at NASA have ranged in duration from a few hours to 17 weeks.  Acute studies of 6-degrees head-down tilt indicate that elevation of capillary blood pressure from 28 to 34 mm Hg and increased capillary perfusion in tissues of the head cause facial and intracranial edema.  Intracranial pressure increases from 2 to 17 mm Hg going from upright posture to 6-degrees head-down tilt.  Microvessels of the head have a low capacity to constrict and diminish local perfusion.  Elevation of blood and tissue fluid pressures/flow in the head may also explain the higher headward bone density associated with long-term head-down tilt.  These mechanistic studies of head-down tilt, along with a better understanding of the relative stresses involved with upright posture and lower body negative pressure, have facilitated development of suitable physiologic countermeasures to maintain astronaut health during microgravity.  Presently no exercise hardware is available to provide a blood pressure gradient from head to feet in space.  However, recent studies in our laboratory suggest that treadmill exercise using a graded lower-body compression suit and 100 mmHg lower body negative pressure provides equivalent or greater physiologic stress than similar upright exercise on Earth.  Therefore, exercise within a lower body negative pressure chamber may provide a cost-effective and simple countermeasure to maintain the cardiovascular and neuro-musculoskeletal systems of astronauts during long-duration flight.

TI The polycompartment syndrome: a concise state-of-the-art review
SO ANAESTHESIOLOGY INTENSIVE THERAPY
AB A compartment syndrome is defined as an increase in the compartmental pressure to such an extent that the viability of the tissues and organs within the compartment are threatened. The term describes a syndrome and not a disease, and as such there are many diseases and underlying pathophysiological processes that may lead to such a scenario. The aim of this review is to give a state-of-the-art overview on the current knowledge on different compartment syndromes and how they may interact. Suggested definitions are included. There are four major compartments in the human body: the head, chest, abdomen, and the extremities. Initially, the term multicompartment syndrome was suggested when more than one compartment was affected. But this led to confusion as the term multi-or multiple compartment syndromes is mostly used in relation to multiple limb trauma leading to compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. Only recently was the term 'polycompartment syndrome' coined to describe a condition where two or more anatomical compartments have elevated pressures. When more than one compartment is affected, an exponential detrimental effect on end-organ function to both immediate and distant organs can occur. Within each compartment, the disease leading towards a compartment syndrome can be primary or secondary. The compliance of each compartment is the key to determining the transmission of a given compartmental pressure from one compartment to another. The intra-abdominal pressure helps to explain the severe pathophysiological condition occurring in patients with cardiorenal, hepatopulmonary and hepatorenal syndromes. Initial treatment of a compartment syndrome should be focused on the primary compartment and is based on three principles: lowering of compartmental pressure, supporting organ perfusion, and optimisation and prevention of specific adverse events. Clinicians need to be aware of the existence of the polycompartment syndrome and the interactions of increased compartmental pressures between compartments.

TI Reversible dementia due to dural arteriovenous fistula: A simple
   surgical option
SO NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW
AB Dural AVMs can produce a wide variety of symptoms related to raised intracranial pressure, venous congestion, and cerebral ischaemia. We present a unique case of reversible dementia. due to venous hypertension. The cerebral ischaemia was caused by extensive bilateral arteriovenous malformations of the external carotid system, which drained into the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses and resulted in venous hypertension. Although partial occlusion by endovascular embolization and ligation procedures had some effect, only 'scalping and silastic implantation' gave satisfactory amelioration of symptoms.

TI Quantitative Phase-Contrast MR Angiography to Measure Hemodynamic
   Changes in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a syndrome of raised intracranial pressure of unknown etiology. Few MR imaging-based studies have investigated arterial and venous blood flow in these patients. Results are inconclusive, and to our knowledge, no comparison of the hemodynamic parameters before and after CSF pressure reduction has been published. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term effects of normalizing CSF pressure on intracranial flow to better understand the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we performed quantitative MR imaging-derived flow measurements of brain-supplying arteries and draining veins/dural sinuses to visualize hemodynamic changes in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension before and after therapy by lumbar puncture in comparison with a healthy control group.
   RESULTS: We found differences in patients before and after lumbar puncture in the calculated resistance and pulsatility indices in the superior sagittal sinus. Venous pulsatility showed a negative correlation with CSF pressure in untreated patients. Additionally, there was a trend toward lower flow in the superior sagittal sinus in patients compared with healthy controls. Flow in the internal jugular veins was significantly reduced by lumbar puncture, and the resistance and pulsatility indices differed in patients and controls. The arterial flow was not influenced by pressure normalization.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate that venous but not arterial blood flow differs in patients compared with controls and that calculating resistance and pulsatility indices may contribute to assessing short-term hemodynamic changes in patients with diagnosed idiopathic intracranial hypertension before and after CSF diversion.

TI Cerebrospinal fluid flow waveforms: effect of altered cranial venous
   outflow - A phase-contrast MR flow imaging study
SO NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Our purpose was to assess the effect of alterations in the cranial venous outflow on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow waveforms using phase-contrast MRI. Thirteen healthy subjects were assessed for CSF flow and cerebral vascular flow at the C2-3 level, both before and after jugular venous compression (JVC). The flow waveforms were assessed both as an aggregate, and after dividing subjects in two groups based on percent jugular venous flow (PJVF) i. e. jugular outflow expressed as percent of cerebral arterial inflow Group 1:7 subjects with PJVF more than and including median (predominantly jugular outflow); Group 2:6 subjects with PJVF less than median (predominantly extra-jugular outflow). CSF waveforms: JVC produced rounding of contours and flattening of dicrotic waves, with the effect being greater in group 1 than group 2, In group 1, systolic upslopes of the waveforms increased. No significant aggregate amplitude changes were noted; amplidutes increased in group 1 (P = 0.001), and decreased in group 2 (P = 0.03). Temporal interval to the maximum CSF systolic flow significantly increased in group 1. Vascular flow: Arterial flow significantly decreased in group 1. Jugular flow significantly decreased in both groups. The results suggest that CSF flow waveforms are sensitive to alterations in the cranial venous outflow. Changes in group 1 are most likely because of an elevation in intracranial pressure. Analysis of CSF flow waveforms appears a promising noninvasive tool for assessment of cranial compartment.

TI Long-term prognosis of idiopathic chronic adult hydrocephalus: I. The
   University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla diagnostic and therapeutic
   protocol
SO NEUROCIRUGIA
AB Introduction: Despite the existence of published guidelines for more than a decade, there is still a substantial variation in the management of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus due to its diagnostic and therapeutic complexity.
   Development: The diagnostic and therapeutic protocol for the management of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus in use at the Department of Neurosurgery of the University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla is presented. The diagnostic process includes neuropsychological testing, phase contrast cine MRI, urodynamic evaluation, continuous intracranial pressure monitoring, cerebrospinal fluid hydrodynamics by means of lumbar infusion testing, and intra-abdominal pressure measurement. A patient is considered a surgical candidate if any of the following criteria is met: mean intracranial pressure > 15 mmHg, or B-waves present in > 10% of overnight recording; pressure-volume index < 15 ml, or resistance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow (R-OUT) > 4.5 mmHg/ml/min in bolus infusion test; R-out, > 12 mmHg/ml/min, intracranial pressure > 22 mmHg, or high amplitude B-waves in the steady-state of the continuous rate infusion test; or a clinical response to high-volume cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal.
   Conclusions: The implementation of a diagnostic and therapeutic protocol for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus management could improve various aspects of patient care. It could reduce variability in clinical practice, optimise the use of health resources, and help in identifying scientific uncertainty areas, in order to direct research efforts in a more appropriate way.

AB Objective - To quantify the course of papilledema using the OCT 3 Stratus (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA) after lateral sinus stent placement in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)
   Methods - Ten consecutive patients with a diagnosis of IIH underwent OCT examination before and after lateral sinus stenting, between March 2006 and April 2008, in Timone Hospital's Ophthalmology Department (Marseille France) All patients had criteria for IIH (International Headache Society, 2004) and sinus abnormalities were diagnosed using three dimensional rotational gadolinium enhanced MR venography In all cases, a direct retrograde cerebral venography with manometry was performed We used the Cord's PRECISE (R) RX Nitinol Stent system (ref 10136245 3, Johnson & Johnson), 30-40 mm in length and 8 mm in diameter, all placed by a single operator via a femoral venous puncture
   For each eye, the mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was noted using the RNFL Thickness (3 4) strategy, before stenting, and three times after stent placement The other parameters considered were age, sex, weight, height and body mass index
   Results - A significant decrease in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was observed after stent placement This parameter was considered normal 3 months after stent placement for eight of ten patients
   Conclusion - Even though this pathology remains misunderstood, we observed a significant decrease in papilledema in IIH after lateral sinus stent placement, suggesting that high intra cranial venous pressure could play a role in this pathology (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS All rights reserved

TI THE CEREBRAL AND SYSTEMIC EFFECTS OF MOVEMENT IN RESPONSE TO A NOXIOUS
   STIMULUS IN LIGHTLY ANESTHETIZED DOGS - POSSIBLE MODULATION OF CEREBRAL
   FUNCTION BY MUSCLE AFFERENTS
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Background: Afferentation theory predicts that agents or maneuvers that stimulate muscle stretch receptors (i.e., muscle afferents) will produce cerebral stimulation. From this theory it follows that, regardless of the source (e.g., drug effect, active muscle movement), increases in stretch receptor activity should result in a similar effect on the brain. The present study tested the hypothesis that active muscle movement in lightly anesthetized subjects would result in cerebral stimulation. Methods: Studies were conducted in six dogs who were lightly anesthetized with halothane (0.70% end-expired). The following physiologic variables were quantified before and for 6 min after the initiation of a standardized (1-min duration) noxious stimulus to the trachea and the skin overlying the hind limb: cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMIRO(2)), cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral vascular resistance, electroencephalogram activity, electromyogram activity, arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2), central venous pressure, and serum epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations. Response to stimulation was evaluated initially in unparalyzed dogs and later was evaluated in the same dogs after they were paralyzed with intravenous pancuronium (0.2 mg/kg). Results: In unparalyzed dogs, stimulation produced episodes of coughing plus head and limb movement during the 6-min study period. Accompanying the movement was activation of the electromyogram, an increase in electroencephalogram frequency, and a reduction in electroencephalogram amplitude. There also was a 35% increase in cerebral blood flow, a 25% decrease in cerebral vascular resistance, and a 7% increase in CMRO(2) versus the baseline values for each variable. There were no significant increases in either cerebral perfusion pressure, central venous pressure, PaCO2, or serum norepinephrine concentration to account for the cerebral effects; however, serum epinephrine concentrations increased by 61%. In pancuronium-paralyzed dogs, noxious stimulation resulted in a 5% increase in cerebral blood flow, a 7% decrease in cerebral vascular resistance, and an 5% Increase hn CMRO(2) versus baseline levels. Electroencephalogram frequency was increased, but amplitude was unchanged. Central venous pressure, electromyogram activity, and serum norepinephrine concentration were unaffected. The serum epinephrine response was similar to that observed when the dogs were not paralyzed. Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that active muscle movement in lightly anesthetized subjects has an effect on the brain that is mediated in part by muscle afferent receptors. This cerebral response was manifested as electroencephalogram activation, cerebral vasodilation unrelated to central venous pressure changes, and an increase in cerebral blood flow greater than that required to meet metabolic demands. Paralysis with pancuronium abolished movement induced by stimulation (and, thus, the muscle afferent response) and also attenuated the cerebral blood flow, cerebral. vascular resistance, and electroencephalogram responses.

TI Transverse sinus stenting without surgical repair in idiopathic CSF
   rhinorrhea associated with transverse sinus stenoses: a pilot study
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE Based on their clinical and radiological patterns, idiopathic CSF rhinorrhea and idiopathic intracranial hypertension can represent different clinical expressions of the same underlying pathological process. Transverse sinus stenoses are associated with both diseases, resulting in eventual restriction of the venous CSF outflow pathway. While venous sinus stenting has emerged as a promising treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, its efficiency on idiopathic CSF leaks has not been very well addressed in the literature so far. The purpose of this study was to report the results of transverse sinus stenting in patients with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea associated with transverse sinus stenoses. METHODS From a prospectively collected database, the authors retrospectively collected the clinical and radiological features of the patients with spontaneous CSF leakage who were treated with venous sinus stenting. RESULTS Five female patients were included in this study. Transverse sinus stenoses were present in all patients, and other radiological signs of idiopathic intracranial hypertension were present in 4 patients. The median transstenotic pressure gradient was 6.5 mm Hg (range 3-9 mm Hg). Venous stenting resulted in the disappearance of the leak in 4 patients with no recurrence and no subsequent meningitis during the follow-up (median 12 months, range 6-63 months). CONCLUSIONS According to the authors' results, venous sinus stenting may result in the disappearance of the leak in many cases of idiopathic CSF rhinorrhea. Larger comparative studies are needed to assess the efficiency and safety of venous stenting as a first-line approach in patients with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea associated with transverse sinus stenoses.

TI Management of moderate and severe head injury in neurosurgical units in

SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB A survey of the 31 neurosurgical units in Australia and Ne tv Zealand was undertaken by the Trauma Committee of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia to determine areas of common practice and areas of divergence in management protocols in the treatment of moderate and severe head injury, Intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement was a fundamental component of care in the majority of units with rises in ICP being treated by sedation, mild hyperventilation (p(a)CO(2) of 30-35 mm Hg) and osmotherapy or cerebrospinal fluid drainage as first choices, Where the ICP was measured selectively following a severe head injury, the computed tomography appearance was used as the criterion for initiation of measurement, All units used at least an arterial line, a central venous pressure monitor and end-tidal CO2 measurement routinely to monitor progress, Attention to the cerebral perfusion pressure with volume support and pressors, together with less intense hyperventilation, were the most common alterations to managmeent protocols made over the preceding 2 years.

   and Pressure Reporting
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING
AB BACKGROUND
   Previous studies have demonstrated that cerebral dural sinus stenosis (DSS) may be a potential patho-physiological cause of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Endovascular therapy for DSS is emerging as a potential alternative to treat IIH. Here, we present the results of our case series.
   METHOD
   We prospectively collected angiographic and manometric data on patients that underwent angioplasty/stenting for IIH. All patients had failed maximal medical therapy (MMT) and had confirmed sinus stenosis. Demographic, clinical and radiological presentation, and outcomes were collected retrospectively.
   RESULTS
   A total of 18 patients underwent 25 procedures. Demographics revealed a mean age of 30 (range 15-59), 83% (15/18) were female, 72% (13/18) were white, and mean body mass index of 36 (range 23-59.2). All patients presented with classic IIH. Symptom improvement or resolution was reported in 94% (17/18) of patients. All patients had resolution and/or stabilization/improvement of their papilledema. Headaches related to increased pressure improved in 56% (10/18). Re-stenosis and retreatment occurred in 33% (6/18). No procedural related complications were reported.
   CONCLUSION
   Dural sinus angioplasty and stenting is relatively safe, feasible, and clinically efficacious for patients with symptomatic sinus stenosis who have failed standard therapy. The long-term durability of patency and clinical improvement remains unknown.

TI Transverse venous sinus stenosis in idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension: a prospective pilot study
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY-JOURNAL CANADIEN D OPHTALMOLOGIE
AB Objective: Whether transverse venous sinus stenosis (TVSS) causes idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or is an effect of the increased intracranial pressures is controversial. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of serial imaging in patients with IIH on medical management.
   Design and Participants: Patients found to have IIH and TVSS on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography (CEMRV) were recruited in a prospective cohort study. Patients were medically managed and followed with a CEMRV immediately after lumbar puncture, 3-6 months after diagnosis with resolution of IIH symptoms, and 1 year after diagnosis. Ophthalmological data were collected at the time of diagnosis, 3-6 months after diagnosis, and 1 year after diagnosis. Feasibility data, including patient recruitment rate, barriers, and logistical issues, were recorded.
   Results: Twenty patients with suspected IIH were screened, and 5 of 7 (71.4%; 95% confidence interval: 36.21-100) eligible patients were enrolled in 1 year, at completion. All recruited patients had clinical resolution of their IIH on medical therapy, and none of them had any obvious change in their TVSS.
   Conclusions: Prospective examination of TVSS with serial magnetic resonance imaging in patients with IIH is feasible. TVSS in patients with IIH did not show any change, despite clinical improvement on medical management in all participants.

TI A narrative review of magnetic resonance imaging findings in pediatric
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS
AB Background and AimsIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare neurological disorder in the pediatric population which is defined as an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) without the presence of brain parenchymal lesions, hydrocephalus, or central nervous system infection. In this study, we have determined the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in IIH patients.MethodsA comprehensive literature search was conducted using the electronic databases including Web of Sciences, Scopus, and Pubmed to identify suitable and relevant articles using keyword search methods. The search included keywords such as "idiopathic intracranial hypertension," "pseudotumor cerebri," "MRI," and "pediatrics." The search was limited to the available publications up to January 2024.ResultsMRI plays a crucial role in diagnosing IIH by excluding secondary causes and revealing neuroimaging findings associated with elevated ICP. Despite fewer studies in children compared to adults, MRI serves as a cornerstone in identifying traditional neuroradiological markers such as empty sella turcica, posterior globe flattening, optic nerve tortuosity, optic nerve sheath distension, and transverse venous sinus stenosis. Additional subtle markers include increased Meckel's cave length, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, and slit-like ventricles, although these are less reliable. Diffusion-weighted imaging does not typically show cerebral ADC value changes indicative of cerebral edema in pediatric IIH.ConclusionMRI findings provide valuable non-invasive diagnostic indicators that facilitate early detection, clinical management, and potential surgical intervention in pediatric IIH. The reliability of these MRI markers underscores their importance in clinical practice.

TI Endovascular stenting of the superior sagittal sinus to alleviate venous
   compression caused by a parasagittal meningioma
SO BMJ CASE REPORTS
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a challenging disease with unclear pathophysiology. Recognition of venous sinus stenting to improve intracranial pressure is increasing. We present a 56-year-old man diagnosed with IIH. A parasagittal meningioma abutting the sagittal sinus causing venous compression was found. Venous sinus stenting via endovascular approach using a WALLSTENT was performed. Intravascular pressures recorded after stenting demonstrated resolution of the pressure gradient. The patient had no complications from the procedure and reported substantial symptomatic improvement. Subsequent ophthalmologic exam demonstrated resolution of the bilateral papilledema noted prior to stenting. Endovascular treatment of venous sinus stenosis in the treatment of IIH is an emerging technique. Treatment of venous compromise due to a mass lesion with stenting is a rarely described concept. For our patient, endovascular stenting was the primary treatment modality, allowing the tumour to be followed with serial imaging.

TI Idiopathic Intracranial Venous Hypertension: Toward a Better
   Understanding of Venous Stenosis and the Role of Stenting in Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Background:Venous sinus stenosis, typically at the junction of the transverse and sigmoid sinus, is increasingly recognized as a contributor to the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), whether it be the intrinsic type that does not reverse with normalization of intracranial pressure or the extrinsic type, which does. Efforts to treat the stenosis and reduce the associated transstenotic gradient through placement of a stent at the site of stenosis have been studied over the past 2 decades, primarily through retrospective studies, with variable emphasis on formal visual testing and direct assessment of poststent opening pressure. Most studies have presented evidence for utilization of stenting as an alternative to cerebrospinal fluid shunting or optic nerve sheath fenestration in patients with IIH who harbor the stenosis and are refractory to or intolerant of intracranial pressure-lowering medications, but an assessment of the current data is needed to better understand the role of stenting for this patient population.Evidence Acquisition:A search in PubMed was made for "IIH," "papilledema," and "venous stenting." Data pre and post stenting, including symptoms attributable to IIH, intracranial pressure, papilledema, retinal nerve fiber layer thickening on optical coherence tomography, and visual field assessment (mean deviation), were collected. Need for retreatment and complications were assessed among all studies. Studies using stenting for special circumstances, such as cerebrospinal leaks or for stenosis along anomalous vessels, were reviewed.Results:In total, 49 studies (45 retrospective and 4 prospective) and 18 case reports (with 3 or less patients) were found and included in the analysis, for a total of 1,626 patients. In 250 patients in whom poststent intracranial pressure was measured, the mean value was 19.7 cm H2O, reduced from a mean of 33 cm H2O. Transient visual obscurations resolved in 79.6% of 201 patients who complained of it, pulsatile tinnitus resolved in 84.7% of 515, diplopia resolved in 93% of 86 patients, and nonspecific visual symptoms such as "blurry vision" improved in 76.2% of 537 patients. Headaches resolved in 36% and improved in a further 40.7% of 1,105 patients in whom they were documented before stenting. Of 1,116 with papilledema, 40.8% demonstrated resolution and 38.2% improvement. The mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness improved from 170.2 mu m to 89.2 mu m among 402 eyes in which optical coherence tomography was used to measure it. Among 135 eyes in which formal visual fields were performed pre and post stenting, the prestent average mean deviation of -7.35 dB improved to -4.72 dB after stenting. Complications associated with stenting included in-stent stenosis or thrombosis, subdural hematoma, intracerebral hematoma, cerebral edema, stent migration, and death. A recurrence of symptoms requiring a follow-up surgical intervention occurred in 9%.Conclusions:A growing body of evidence supports the use of venous sinus stenting as a viable option for medically refractory IIH, especially when papilledema threatens visual function. Complication and failure rates seem to be similar to alternative surgical approaches, although serious neurological sequalae can rarely occur. Emerging studies evaluating stent type, including novel stents designed for use in the venous system, may help improve ease of the procedure and long-term success rates. Prospective head-to-head studies are needed to better understand the performance of stenting compared with other interventions.

TI Successful treatment of negative pressure hydrocephalus using timely
   titrated external ventricular drainage: a case series
SO CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
AB Objective: Negative-pressure hydrocephalus (NegPH) is a rare clinical entity characterised by enlarged ventricles and symptoms consistent with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in the setting of negative ICP. Little has been published regarding appropriate treatment and outcomes of negative-pressure hydrocephalus patients, and no data have been published demonstrating successful therapy producing acceptable long-term outcomes. Here we present 8 cases successfully treated by titrated external ventricular drainage (TEVD), including drainage at negative (subatmospheric) pressure, and subsequent low-pressure ventriculoperitoneal shunting.
   Methods. A retrospective audit of all cases of negative-pressure hydrocephalus occurring at a university teaching hospital between 2006 and 2012 was undertaken. The clinical features of these cases, results of radiological investigations, treatment, and outcome were drawn from the patients' records.
   Results: Eight cases of NegPH were identified. All patients had at least one preceding intracranial procedure (mean number of procedures 3.0). All cases were treated using TEVD, titrated to produce between 5 and 15 mL per hour of CSF drainage, including drainage under subatmospheric pressure if this was required to maintain CSF flow. Mean delay from first negative ICP to TEVD was 1.8 days. All 8 patients demonstrated clinical improvement. TEVD resulted in improvement in Glasgow Coma Scale (mean increase 4.6, p = 0.003), and increases in ICP (mean increase 8.5, p < 0.001). Mean length of follow-up was 471.8 days. At follow-up, four patients had returned to pre-morbid functioning, three had a reduction in functioning attributable to their initial presentation (not NegPH), and one had died of unknown cause. Illustrative case descriptions are included.
   Conclusions: Negative-pressure hydrocephalus is a rare but underrecognised syndrome that can be successfully treated by timely external ventricular drainage titrated to maintain CSF flow, and subsequent low-Pressure ventriculoperitoneal shunting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI NEUROGENIC PULMONARY-EDEMA IN CHILDHOOD
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
AB Patients (3) presenting pulmonary edema associated with head trauma and increased intracranial pressure are described. Pulmonary edema is a clearly recognized complication of head trauma; the pathogenic mechanisms appear to be regulated by increased intracerebral pressure, sympathetically induced vascular hypertension and increased pulmonary capillary permeability. If there is evidence that neurogenic pulmonary edema is the underlying etiology, therapeutic modalities should be directed at reducing intracranial pressure and strict attention paid to the interaction between intrathoracic and intracranial pressures to avoid the high mortality rate associated with this condition.

TI Modulation of renal sympathetic nerve activity during pneumoperitoneum
   in rats
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB To examine neural control of renal function during pneumoperitoneum, renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) was measured in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats that had their entire nervous system intact or that had undergone lower thoracic dorsal rhizotomy or abdominal vagotomy. During pneumoperitoneum with intraabdominal pressure (IAP) of 10 mmHg, the mean arterial pressure did not change, but central venous pressure increased by 10 mmHg in all groups. In intact rats, the RSNA increased to 285 +/- 22% during pneumoperitoneum and gradually recovered after release of the insufflation. The RSNA responses decreased during pneumoperitoneum in rats with dorsal rhizotomy or vagotomy compared to responses in intact rats. In intact rats the urine volume and Na+ excretion decreased during pneumoperitoneum and increased just after insufflation release. Dorsal rhizotomy, vagotomy, or renal denervation did not alter the antidiuretic and antinatriuretic responses during pneumoperitoneum; however, diuretic and natriuretic responses were completely abolished by either of these denervations following insufflation release. These results suggest that oliguria during pneumoperitoneum was not due to neural control of renal function but probably to a mechanical influence induced by the elevated LAP. On the other hand, diuretic and natriuretic responses after insufflation release were thought to be a neurally mediated response.

TI Mathematical Modeling of CSF Pulsatile Hydrodynamics Based on
   Fluid-Solid Interaction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Intracranial pressure (ICP) is derived from cerebral blood pressure and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulatory dynamics and can be affected in the course of many diseases. Computer analysis of the ICP time pattern plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of those diseases. This study proposes the application of Linninger et al.'s [IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., vol. 52, no. 4, pp. 557-565, Apr. 2005] fluid-solid interaction model of CSF hydrodynamic in ventricular system based on our clinical data from a group of patients with brain parenchyma tumor. The clinical experiments include the arterial blood pressure (ABP), venous blood pressure, and ICP in the subarachnoid space (SAS). These data were used as inputs to the model that predicts the intracranial dynamic phenomena. In addition, the model has been modified by considering CSF pulsatile production rate as the major factor of CSF motion. The approximations of ventricle enlargement, CSF pressure distribution in the ventricular system and CSF velocity magnitude in the aqueduct and foramina were obtained in this study. The observation of reversal flow in the CSF flow pattern due to brain tissue compression is another finding in our investigation. Based on the experimental results, no existence of large transmural pressure differences were found in the brain system. The measured pressure drop in the ventricular system was less than 5 Pa. Moreover, the CSF flow pattern, ICP distribution, and velocity magnitude were in good agreement with the published models and CINE (phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging) experiments, respectively.

TI A Rare Case of Negative-Pressure Hydrocephalus: A Plausible Explanation
   and the Role of Transmantle Theory
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Negative-pressure hydrocephalus is a rare condition with the development of symptomatic hydrocephalus despite subnormal intracranial pressure (ICP). The etiology remains unclear. Some authors proposed that the differential pressure between the ventricular space and the subarachnoid space over cerebral convexity leads to the development of ventriculomegaly, namely as the transmantle pressure theory.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old patient with a left Sylvian fissure arachnoid cyst underwent several surgeries including cystoperitoneal shunts and fenestrations of the cyst. The patient developed a cerebrospinal fluid fistula from the cranial wound was complicated by bacterial meningitis. Consequently, the shunt was removed, and external cyst drainage was placed. After 9 days, the patient developed acute hydrocephalus requiring external ventricular drainage (EVD). Two days later, after overdrainage of the external cyst drain, the patient suffered neurologic deterioration. The ICP measured by the EVD was -4 cm H2O, and a computed tomography scan demonstrated progression of the hydrocephalus. The external cyst drainage was shut off and the EVD level was adjusted to produce between 5 and 10 mL/hour of cerebrospinal fluid under a subatmospheric pressure set at -5 cm H2O, and gradually raised in increments of 1 cm every 3 days until a positive ICP occurred. Once clinical and radiographic stability was accomplished, a programmable ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted set to 30 mm H2O. A marked clinical and radiologic improvement was observed in the follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: This negative-pressure hydrocephalus case report supports the main role of the transmantle pressure theory. The subatmospheric EVD method and a low-pressure valve resulted in excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes.

The main goal of treatment is to prevent visual loss, and often patients report resolution of headache and visual symptoms within 21 mo of mean follow-up.(-) We present the case of a 57-yr-old woman with medically refractory IIH, bilateral sinus stenosis, and a mass lesion causing stenosis on the left. Venous angiogram with pressure monitoring was completed with the patient awake, which showed a significant pressure gradient on the right (19 mm Hg) and borderline gradient on the left (8 mm Hg). Options were reviewed and decision was made to proceed with the treatment of the right-sided stenosis with stenting and continue with the observation of the lesion on the left to prevent further visual deterioration. The patient consented for the procedure, and she tolerated the procedure well. Neurological exam remained at baseline, and she was discharged home on post-operative day #1. At 2 mo's follow-up, the patient reported improvement in headaches and remained intact neurologically.

TI Cerebral venous overdrainage: an under-recognized complication of
   cerebrospinal fluid diversion
SO NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB Understanding the altered physiology following cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion in the setting of adult hydrocephalus is important for optimizing patient care and avoiding complications. There is mounting evidence that the cerebral venous system plays a major role in intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics especially when one takes into account the effects of postural changes, atmospheric pressure, and gravity on the craniospinal axis as a whole. An evolved mechanism acting at the cortical bridging veins, known as the "Starling resistor," prevents overdrainage of cranial venous blood with upright positioning. This protective mechanism can become nonfunctional after CSF diversion, which can result in posture-related cerebral venous overdrainage through the cranial venous outflow tracts, leading to pathological states. This review article summarizes the relevant anatomical and physiological bases of the relationship between the craniospinal venous and CSF compartments and surveys complications that may be explained by the cerebral venous overdrainage phenomenon. It is hoped that this article adds a new dimension to our therapeutic methods, stimulates further research into this field, and ultimately improves our care of these patients.

TI Endoscopic third ventriculostomy in hydrocephalus associated with
   achondroplasia Report of 3 cases
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB Hydrocephalus in patients with achondroplasia is thought to be due to increased dural sinus venous pressure resulting from narrowing of the jugular foramen. In this setting, where hydrocephalus is presumed to be "vascular" in origin and therefore communicating, endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) would seem contraindicated. The authors describe 3 patients in whom ETV was successfully performed, resulting in MR imaging-documented decreases in ventricle size. The patients were 11 months, 33 months, and 13 years at the time of surgery. All patients had serial preoperative MR images demonstrating progressive hydrocephalus in a "triventricular" pattern with a small fourth ventricle but an open aqueduct. All patients had undergone suboccipital decompression for foramen magnum stenosis prior to the treatment of hydrocephalus. Preoperative retrograde venography revealed variable pressure gradients across the jugular foramen. It is postulated that the increase in intracranial venous pressure resulting from jugular foramen stenosis may lead to disproportionate venous engorgement of the cerebellum and some degree of obstructive hydrocephalus amenable to ETV. The authors discuss the role of suboccipital decompression in the progression of hydrocephalus in patients with achondroplasia. (http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2011.10.PEDS1169)

TI Reviving lower body negative pressure as a countermeasure to prevent
   pathological vascular and ocular changes in microgravity
SO NPJ MICROGRAVITY
AB Mitigation of spaceflight-related pathologies such as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) and the recently discovered risk of venous thrombosis must happen before deep space exploration can occur. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) can simulate gravitational stress during spaceflight that is likely to counteract SANS and venous thrombosis, but the ideal dose and method of delivery have yet to be determined. We undertook a review of current LBNP literature and conducted a gap analysis to determine the steps needed to adapt LBNP for in-flight use. We found that to use LBNP in flight, it must be adapted to long time duration/low pressure use that should be compatible with crew activities. A lack of understanding of the etiology of the pathologies that LBNP can counteract hinders the application of LBNP as a countermeasure during spaceflight. Future research should aim at filling the knowledge gaps outlined in this review.

TI Ten physiological commandments for severe head injury
SO REVISTA ESPANOLA DE ANESTESIOLOGIA Y REANIMACION
AB Advances in multiparametric brain monitoring have allowed us to deepen our knowledge of the physiopathology of head injury and how it can be treated using the therapies available today. It is essential to understand and interpret a series of basic physiological and physiopathological principles that, on the one hand, provide an adequate metabolic environment to prevent worsening of the primary brain injury and favour its recovery, and on the other hand, allow therapeutic resources to be individually adapted to the specific needs of the patient.
   Based on these notions, this article presents a decalogue of the physiological objectives to be achieved in brain injury, together with a series of diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for achieving these goals. We emphasise the importance of considering and analysing the physiological variables involved in the transport of oxygen to the brain, such as cardiac output and arterial oxygen content, together with their conditioning factors and possible alterations. Special attention is paid to the basic elements of physiological neuroprotection, and we describe the multiple causes of cerebral hypoxia, how to approach them, and how to correct them. We also examine the increase in intracranial pressure as a physiopathological element, focussing on the significance of thoracic and abdominal pressure in the interpretation of intracranial pressure. Treatment of intracranial pressure should be based on a step-wise model, the first stage of which should be based on a physiopathological reflection combined with information on the tomographic lesions rather than on rigid numerical values.

TI Anaesthesia for neurosurgery
SO ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Neuroanaesthesia is an expanding speciality that requires a good understanding of neurophysiology as well as the pathophysiology of raised intracranial pressure. Neuroanaesthetists need to ensure neurosurgical patients maintain an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure intraoperatively, while providing optimum operating conditions. To achieve this, a balanced anaesthetic technique preventing hypertensive surges and optimizing cerebral venous drainage by careful patient positioning is important. Knowledge of the therapeutic options available to the anaesthetist for decreasing ICP intraoperatively is essential. As neurosurgery evolves, it provides neuroanaesthetists with new challenges including awake craniotomies, stereotactic neurosurgery and intraoperative MRI.

TI Dural venous sinus thrombosis after lumbar puncture in a patient with
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Introduction: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is one of the most common causes of papilloedema seen by ophthalmologists and neurologists. Patients with IIH routinely undergo lumbar puncture (LP) for diagnosis. Dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST) is a rare complication of cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSF)-lowering procedures such as lumbar puncture and epidural and may be an intracranial complication of IIH. Case Description: A 29-year-old obese woman was diagnosed with severe idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) after she presented with new-onset headache, pulsatile tinnitus and blurred vision. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and venography (MRV) were normal apart from signs of intracranial hypertension. Lumbar puncture (LP) revealed an opening pressure of 40 cm of water. Due to the severity of the papilloedema and vision loss, she was referred for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and found to have venous sinus thrombosis involving the superior sagittal sinus on the pre-operative computed tomography (CT) head 5 days after the LP. CT venography (CTV) one day later and MRV 3 days later showed significant worsening as the thrombosis extended into the deep venous system. She was started on therapeutic heparin and her symptoms and vision improved and she did not develop any neurological complications. Conclusions: DVST should be considered in IIH patients who have worsening papilloedema or symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Repeat venous imaging can prevent devastating consequences such as venous infarcts of haemorrhage in these patients.

TI CT evaluation of sigmoid plate dehiscence causing pulsatile tinnitus
SO EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
AB To evaluate the characteristics of sigmoid plate dehiscence (SPD) causing pulsatile tinnitus (PT) on CT arteriography and venography (CTA + V).
   Thirty PT patients treated successfully with SPD reconstruction were enrolled. Sixty asymptomatic patients were matched. The location, extent, number of SPD cases and concomitant signs, including venous outflow dominance, transverse sinus stenosis, high jugular bulb, temporal bone pneumatization, height of pituitary gland and pituitary fossa, abnormal mastoid emissary vein, were detected and compared using CTA + V.
   More than one SPD was found on the symptomatic side in 13/30 PT patients (43.3 %). The upper segment of the sigmoid plate was involved in 29/44 SPDs in the vertical direction (65.9 %); the lateral wall was involved in 38/44 SPDs in the horizontal direction (86.4 %). Singular SPD was detected in 3/60 asymptomatic patients (1.67 +/- 0.35 mm(2)), less so in PT patients (7.97 +/- 5.17 mm(2)). Compared with the control group, ipsilateral venous outflow dominance, high jugular bulb and bilateral transverse sinus stenosis were more common in the PT group, together with deeper pituitary fossa and flatter pituitary glands.
   SPD causing PT has characteristic CT findings. It may be generated by vascular or intracranial pressure abnormalities and act as a common key to triggering PT's perception.

TI Surgical and endovascular interventions in idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension
SO CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY
AB Purpose of reviewIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a potentially blinding disease and may require surgical management when maximal medical treatment has failed. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current literature on surgical and endovascular treatments for IIH.Recent findingsThe most commonly performed surgical treatments for IIH are cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures (e.g. ventriculo- and lumbo-peritoneal shunts) and optic nerve sheath fenestration. Controversy still exists about which is the preferred initial surgical treatment for IIH. Emerging procedures include venous sinus stenting in cases with venous sinus stenosis, and bariatric surgery for weight loss. Cranial (suboccipital or subtemporal) decompression was a more popular surgical procedure in the past, but can still have a role in selected cases with impaired cerebrospinal flow dynamics (e.g. Chiari malformation) or after multiple failed conventional surgical procedures.SummaryThis review compares and contrasts the surgical management options for IIH.

TI Issues in the Diagnosis and Management of the Papilledema Shunt
SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Background: Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) that shunt blood into the transverse or superior sagittal venous sinuses cause papilledema by raising intracranial pressure ("the papilledema shunt"). Such fistulas pose unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
   Methods: Case report and literature review.
   Results: In a patient presenting with papilledema, non-invasive brain vascular imaging disclosed subtle signs of a DAVF. Digital angiography delineated the DAVF and revealed cortical venous reflux. After three transarterial embolizations with ethylene vinyl alcohol, the DAVF was closed and papilledema resolved.
   Conclusions: The imaging features of a DAVF that cause papilledema may be subtle on non-invasive vascular imaging. If overlooked, and lumbar puncture is performed, there is a substantial risk of brain herniation. Cortical venous reflux, which may be relatively common in these DAVFs, impels the need for endovascular closure. The transvenous route, often employed for closing cavernous sinus DAVFs, should be avoided because of the dangers of dural venous sinus thrombosis.

TI Stent Survival and Stent-Adjacent Stenosis Rates following Venous Sinus
   Stenting for Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: A Systematic Review
   and Meta-Analysis
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEUROLOGY
AB Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by an elevated intracranial pressure without any identifiable causative factor such as an intracranial mass. Dural venous sinus stenosis (DVSS) has been suggested to be associated with IIH. Objective: We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to determine clinical outcomes as well as stent survival and stent-adjacent stenosis rates in patients undergoing DVSS for the management of medically refractory IIH. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to identify prospective or retrospective cohorts or case series of patients with IIH treated with DVSS between 2000 and 2017. Results: A total of 473 patients were included from 24 studies. Headache was present in 429 (91.8%) patients and resolved or improved in 319/413 (77.2%) after the procedure. Headache, papilledema, visual acuity, and tinnitus improved in 256/330 (77.6%), 247/288 (85.8%), 121/172 (70.3%), and 93/110 (84.5%) patients following DVSS at the final follow-up (mean of 18.3 months). In a meta-analysis of 395 patients with available follow-up data on stenting outcome (mean of 18.9 months), the stent survival and stent-adjacent stenosis rates were 84% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7987%) and 14% (95% CI 11-18%), respectively. The rate of major neurological complications was less than 2%. Conclusion: Stent-adjacent stenosis is an important complication following venous stenting in patients with DVSS and IIH. Further studies are needed to identify determinants of stent-adjacent stenosis and stent nonsurvival. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI Ventriculo peritoneal shunted patient undergoing laparoscopic procedure
   - A case report and review of the literature
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
AB Introduction and importance: It has been more than century since the establishment of relationship between the intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraabdominal pressure (IAP) was suspected and confirmed backed up by several studies. The studies clearly demonstrate a link and the positive correlation between the two. Case summary: 18 years old lady with previous history of ventricular peritoneal shunt during 6 months of age was planned for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively free flow of CSF was observed without any intraoperative and post-operative complications. Discussion: Pneumoperitoneum created during laparoscopic procedures may lead to the rise in ICP and thus, lead to serious consequences. This has been of a growing concern in a patient with Ventriculo Peritoneal Shunt (VP Shunt) in situ. The uncertainty regarding the safety of laparoscopic procedures in VP shunted patients thus, has been a subject of debate over the years. Conclusion: Our aim therefore is to depict similar case we encountered in our department and based on it, we reviewed the literature in the quest of determining the safety of Laparoscopic procedure in patients with VP shunt.

TI MRI-based investigation on outflow segment of cerebral venous system
   under increased ICP condition
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB Objective: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is responsible for causing most nervous system diseases to progress seriously, till death. Recently, volume-targeted therapeutic strategy against increased ICP, which works by releasing excessive intracranial liquid especially from the venous compartment, attracted a great deal of attention. Previous research by us found a structurally special "outflow segment cuff" that is located at the juncture of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the brain-bridging veins in porcine model. Sequential observation demonstrated that this special structure appeared to have functional abnormalities. Based on these findings, it was proposed to try and prove a further hypothesis that there exists a similar structure in human beings that might be of importance for cerebral venous system to intervene in volume-initiated ICP regulation. Meanwhile, the diameters of bridging veins under either increased or normal ICP are compared by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Method: Forty patients who presented with increased ICP were selected to undergo 2D time of flight (TOF) venography and ten normal volunteers were taken as the control group. Increased intracranial pressure status was evaluated by using flash visual evoked potential (fVEP) technique. All the patients and volunteers underwent 2D-TOF MRI imaging for the following parameters: repetition time/echo time, 50/4.9 milliseconds; flip angle, 45 degrees; field of view, 250x250 mm; matrix, 256x256 pixels; section thickness, 1.5 mm. Syngo fastview imaging system was used to process and analyze the targeted brain-bridging venous section.
   Results: By using 2D-TOF method in vivo, most bridging venous profiles as well as SSS and vicinal cortical veins could be clearly visualized. A short and narrow section, as previously described, obviously emerged because of MRI signal weakness even disappearing at the juncture of SSS and bridging veins in increased ICP patients. In combination with previous animal morphological findings we believe that this section with abnormal MRI signal could stand for the human counterpart of "outflow segment cuff" in porcine. Such a special structure could be observed within a majority of increased ICP patients (32/40 cases), whereas only one case presented the existence of similar imaging signal weakness. Furthermore, the diameters of the bridging veins in increased ICP group are statistically larger than the control group.
   Conclusion: Intracranial venous compartment occupies about 70 to 80% blood volume inside the inflexible cranial cavity. Following volume-targeted rationale, ICP can be regulated effectively by the fluctuation of venous blood volume based on different aspects of morphology, biomechanics, and hemodynamics. In the present study, the coincidence of animal model and human venography in vivo offers strong evidences to support the hypothesis that venous hemodynamics, although passively, influences intracranial pressure environment through a possible key regulator - outflow segment narrow structure. The fact that this narrow formation and proximal vascular dilation appears more in patients under high ICP condition rather than in patients with normal pressure. Both narrow formation and proximal vascular dilation indicate its significant contribution to intracranial venous congestion, resulting from difficult drainage and the close relationship between intracranial venous volume and ICP.

TI What is new about idiopathic intracranial hypertension? An updated
   review of mechanism and treatment
SO CEPHALALGIA
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is the syndrome of raised intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory or radiological evidence of intracranial pathology. IIH is a relatively rare disease but rapidly increasing incidence is reported due to a global increasing incidence of obesity. Disease course is generally said to be self-limiting within a few months. However, some patients experience a disabling condition of chronic severe headache and visual disturbances for years that limit their capacity to work. Permanent visual defects are serious and not infrequent complications. The pathophysiology of IIH is still not fully understood. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have facilitated the exclusion of associated conditions that may mimic IIH. No causal treatment is yet known for IIH and existing treatment is symptomatic and rarely sufficient. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of this potentially disabling disease which may show a future escalating incidence due to obesity. Theories of pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies are discussed.

TI The effects of superimposed tilt and lower body negative pressure on
   anterior and posterior cerebral circulations
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB Steady-state tilt has no effect on cerebrovascular reactivity to increases in the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2). However, the anterior and posterior cerebral circulations may respond differently to a variety of stimuli that alter central blood volume, including lower body negative pressure (LBNP). Little is known about the superimposed effects of head-up tilt (HUT; decreased central blood volume and intracranial pressure) and head-down tilt (HDT; increased central blood volume and intracranial pressure), and LBNP on cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses. We hypothesized that (a) cerebral blood velocity (CBV; an index of CBF) responses during LBNP would not change with HUT and HDT, and (b) CBV in the anterior cerebral circulation would decrease to a greater extent compared to posterior CBV during LBNP when controlling PETCO2. In 13 male participants, we measured CBV in the anterior (middle cerebral artery, MCAv) and posterior (posterior cerebral artery, PCAv) cerebral circulations using transcranial Doppler ultrasound during LBNP stress (-50mmHg) in three body positions (45 degrees HUT, supine, 45 degrees HDT). PETCO2 was measured continuously and maintained at constant levels during LBNP through coached breathing. Our main findings were that (a) steady-state tilt had no effect on CBV responses during LBNP in both the MCA (P=0.077) and PCA (P=0.583), and (b) despite controlling for PETCO2, both the MCAv and PCAv decreased by the same magnitude during LBNP in HUT (P=0.348), supine (P=0.694), and HDT (P=0.407). Here, we demonstrate that there are no differences in anterior and posterior circulations in response to LBNP in different body positions.

   with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO PLOS ONE
AB Objective
   Evaluate the role of venous sinus stenting in the treatment of pulsatile tinnitus among patients with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) and significant venous sinus stenosis.
   Subjects and Methods
   A written informed consent approved by the Weill Cornell institutional review board was signed and obtained from the study participants. Thirty-seven consecutive patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis who were treated with venous sinus stenting between Jan. 2012-Jan. 2016 were prospectively evaluated. Patients without pulsatile tinnitus were excluded. Tinnitus severity was categorized based on "Tinnitus Handicap Inventory" (THI) at pre-stent, day-0, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, 18-month and 2-year follow-up. Demographics, body-mass index (BMI), pre and post VSS trans-stenotic pressure gradient were documented. Statistical analysis performed using Pearson's correlation, Chi-square analysis and Fischer's exact test.

   29 patients with a mean age of 29.5 +/- 8.5 years M:F = 1:28. Median (mean) THI pre and post stenting were: 4 (3.7) and 1 (1) respectively. Median time of tinnitus resolution post VSS was 0-days. There was significant improvement of THI (Delta Mean: 2.7 THI [95% CI: 2.3-3.1 THI], p<0.001) and transverse-distal sigmoid sinus gradient (Delta Mean:-15.3 mm Hg [95% CI: 12.7-18 mm Hg], p<0.001) post-stenting. Mean follow-up duration of 26.4 +/- 9.8 months (3-44 months). VSS was feasible in 100% patients with no procedural complications. Three-patients (10%) had recurrent sinus stenosis and tinnitus at mean follow-up of 12 months (6-30 months).
   Conclusion Venous sinus stenting is an effective treatment for pulsatile tinnitus in patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis.

TI Spontaneous thrombosis of vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation
SO PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY
AB Two cases of aneurysmal malformations of the vein of Galen (AVG) with spontaneous th rom bos is are reported. Angiogram and MRI before thrombosis demonstrated AVGs with stow arteriovenous shunts and associated stagnation of contrast in the venous sac secondary to severe outflow restriction. Based on these findings, one patient was managed conservatively, and the other underwent placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Surveillance of the lesions with subsequent MRIs revealed spontaneous thrombosis of the AVGs with excellent clinical outcomes. Proposed mechanisms of spontaneous thrombosis include slow flow shunts, obstruction of the venous outflow or obstruction of the feeding artery. Similar cases in the literature are reviewed with special emphasis on diagnostic tests, symptomatology, mechanisms of thrombosis and therapeutic options.

TI Indomethacin for treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension
   secondary to acute liver failure
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY
AB Purpose. Successful use of i.v. indomethacin for urgent management of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to acute liver failure is reported.
   Summary. A 42-year-old woman receiving intensive care for fulminant hepatic failure secondary to acetaminophen toxicity developed cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension refractory to standard pharmacotherapy and respiratory support measures. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's head was ordered as part of an evaluation for liver transplantation, but the patient's severely elevated ICP precluded supine positioning for the CT study (throughout the hospital stay, the head of the patient's bed was kept at a 30 degrees angle to optimize cerebral venous outflow). With administration of indomethacin 10 mg by i.v. injection, the ICP decreased from 29 to 13 mm Hg and remained at goal after the patient was placed in a fully supine position for a period long enough to permit the CT scan. Indomethacin was used a second time to facilitate CT imaging several days later. No adverse effects attributable to indomethacin use were documented. Although the patient underwent successful liver transplantation, her mental status and overall clinical status continued to deteriorate and she died on postoperative day 12.
   Conclusion. Despite the poor overall patient outcome in this case, i.v. indomethacin was successfully used to decrease ICP in order to facilitate CT imaging as part of a transplantation eligibility workup.

TI Correlation of Positive End-Expiratory and Intracranial Pressure Using
   the Ultrasonographic-Guided Measurement of Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter
   in Traumatic Brain Injury Patients
SO NEUROLOGY INDIA
AB Background: In brain injury patients, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may potentially increase the intracranial pressure (ICP). ICP can be noninvasively assessed from the sonographic measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). Herein, we aim to evaluate the association between PEEP and ICP via measuring ONSD in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.
   Methods: TBI patients with age >= 18 years, severe brain injury (GCS 8 or less), receiving mechanical ventilation, initial PEEP <= 4 mmHg and no history of severe cardiopulmonary disease were included in this study. Patients with intracranial hypertension (defined as ICP >20 mmHg) and already receiving PEEP >15 cm H2O at enrollment were excluded from the study. ONSD measurement was performed when hemodynamic parameters were most stable. Variables included central venous pressure, invasive blood pressure, heart rate, saturation, and ventilator parameters.
   Results: The ONSD and ICP did not increase significantly while PEEP increased from 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm H2O. However, ONSD and ICP significantly increased when PEEP increased from 10-15 cm H2O. There was no significant difference noted while comparing measurements of optic nerve sheath (ONS) diameter in both eyes at all PEEP values in cases as well as control patients. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased with an increase in PEEP value. Highly significant decrease occurred in MAP change from PEEP 10-15 in cases (P < 0.001) and control (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The PEEP up to 10 cm H2O can be safely applied in patients with TBI. In addition, the increment of PEEP might further increase the oxygenation, at the cost of ICP accentuation.

TI Hospital infectious disease emergency preparedness: A survey of
   infection control professionals
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
AB Background: Hospital preparedness for infectious disease emergencies is imperative for local, regional, and national response planning.
   Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted of a survey administered to Infection Control Professionals (ICPs) in May, 2005.
   Results: Most hospitals have ICP representation on their disaster committee, around-the-clock infection control support, a plan to prioritize health care workers to receive vaccine or antivirals, and non-health care facility surge beds. Almost 20% lack a surge capacity plan. Some lack negative pressure rooms for current patient loads or any surge capacity. Less than half have a plan for rapid set-up of negative pressure, and Midwest hospitals are less likely than other areas to have such plans. Smaller hospitals have less negative pressure surge capacity than do larger hospitals, About half have enough health care workers to respond to a surge that involves 50 patients; few can handle 100 patients. Many do not have sufficient ventilators or can handle <= 10 additional ventilated patients. Most do riot have enough National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved respirators, and less than half have sufficient surgical masks to handle a significant surge.
   Conclusions: United States hospitals lack negative pressure, health care worker, and medical equipment/supplies surge capacity Hospitals must continue to address gaps in infectious disease emergency planning.

TI Primary stabbing headache: a new dural sinus stenosis-associated primary
   headache?
SO NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Primary stabbing headache (PSH) is a primary syndrome of unknown aetiology, characterised by brief, jabbing stabs predominantly felt in the orbital, temporal and parietal areas, whose frequency may vary from one to many per day, usually responding to indomethacin. PSH frequency in the general population is not well defined, but recent evidence suggests it could be more frequent than previously thought. In clinical series, PSH incidence was 33/100,000 per year, while in a population study 35.2 % prevalence was found. PSH was previously described as isolated or associated to other headache syndromes, most frequently with migraine. There is evidence that an idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema, a condition usually associated to significant stenosis of dural sinuses (93 % sensitivity and specificity), is much more prevalent than believed and may run asymptomatically in up to 11 % of otherwise healthy individuals. In migrainous prone people, a sinus stenosis-associated intracranial hypertension without papilledema (ss-IHWOP) comorbidity may represent a powerful risk factor for progression of pain. Besides migraine, significant sinus stenosis has been found over-represented also in chronic tension type headache as well as in exertional, cough, sexual activity-associated headaches (all indomethacin responsive primary headaches) and in altitude headache (an acetazolamide responsive condition). To explore the possible association between venous outflow disturbances and PSH, we retrospectively investigated the co-occurrence of sinus venous stenosis in patients referring to our headache centre since 2004 diagnosed with PSH who completed the diagnostic protocol. Out of 50 consecutive patients reporting PSH as the main or as accessory complaint, 8 (6 females, 2 males) performed MR venography (MRV). All MRV revealed significant unilateral or bilateral sinus stenosis. Mean age at PSH onset was 35.3 +/- 18.9 years (range 11-67 years). Duration of attacks ranged 1-3 s. Median daily frequency of attacks was 4 (range 2-20); median number of days per month with PSH presentation was 14 (range 4-30). Six patients described attacks in temporal or parietal areas, one at the top of the head, and one in the occipital area. Only one patient had isolated PSH; all the others were diagnosed also with migraine without aura. Seven out of eight patients responded to indomethacin 75 mg/die, and one to topiramate 100 mg/die. Interestingly, both drugs share with acetazolamide a CSF pressure lowering effect. Our findings indicate that PSH is associated with central sinus stenosis and suggest that an undiagnosed ss-IHWOP might be involved in PSH pathogenesis.

TI Complex craniosynostoses: a review of the prominent clinical features
   and the related management strategies
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB The protocols for clinical evaluation and management of children with complex craniosynostoses are significantly different from those used in single suture forms. The time at which the various anatomical and functional anomalies observed in the affected subjects become clinically relevant varies from patient to patient, consequently requiring a tailored approach. The clinical course is variable and influenced by multiple factors, acting at different steps of the children growth. Intracranial hypertension is a major concern already in the first months of life; active cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics disorders, venous hypertension, and progressive craniocerebral disproportion are considered the main pathogenetic factors. Cranial vault and skull base sutures synostoses account for the frequently observed increased venous pressure. Skull base abnormalities lead to upper airways obstruction, which, on one side, might create significant upper airways obstructive problems and, on the other, contribute to the increase in the intracranial pressure. Secondary Chiari malformation is common and considered as a progressive disorder, mainly due to progressive craniocerebral disproportion, venous hypertension, and CSF dynamics disorders. Optic nerve and orbit-related eye-globe diseases are also a major concern. Papilledema is mostly related to increased intracranial pressure. The skull base synostotic process is the base of significant abnormalities of the orbital space, ending in the common feature of significant proptosis with the consequent risk of corneal ulcers. Aims of this paper are to analyze the physiopathogenetic mechanisms at the base of the clinical manifestations presented by children with complex craniosynostoses, and the therapeutic options currently available.

TI Optic nerve sheath decompression for visual loss in intracranial
   hypertension: Report from a tertiary care center in South India
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Aim: Severe visual loss is the only serious complication of intracranial hypertension secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and some cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). Optic nerve sheath decompression (ONSD) has been shown to improve or stabilize visual function in patients with IIH, while its role in CVT is yet to be established. We report our experience with optic nerve sheath decompression for visual loss in IIH and CVT.
   Materials and Methods: In this prospective noncomparative, interventional study, 41 eyes of 21 patients with IIH and CVT and visual loss underwent ONSD. The main outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), visual fields, pupillary light reflex, optic nerve sheath diameter on B-scan and resolution of papilledema which were evaluated preoperatively and at follow-up at four days, two weeks, one month, three months and final follow-up. In 7/41 eyes with absent light perception preoperatively, the functional outcome was analyzed separately.
   Results: Following ONSD BCVA and visual fields stabilized or improved in 32/34 (94%) eyes. Statistically significant improvement in BCVA, visual fields and pupillary light reflex occurred over the three month follow-up period. Surgical success was indicated by reduction in optic nerve diameter and papilledema resolution occurred in all patients. The outcome in the IIH and CVT groups was comparable. Four eyes with absent light perception showed marginal improvement in visual acuity Four eyes had transient benign complications.
   Conclusion: Optic nerve sheath decompression is an effective and safe procedure to improve or stabilize vision in patients with visual loss caused by IIH and CVT.

TI Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: Review of Clinical Syndrome,
   Imaging Findings, and Treatment
SO CURRENT PROBLEMS IN DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a syndrome of unknown cause that is increasing in frequency. Patients who are typically women of childbearing age and obese present with headaches and may also present with visual changes that may become chronic. The purpose of this review is to describe the possible mechanisms for this disease and also to illustrate the ever increasing role of imaging in the diagnosis of this disorder. In addition, the various methods of treatment including medical and surgical will be reviewed. The fact that idiopathic intracranial hypertension has undergone many name changes over the years serves as a reminder that the underlying mechanism is still not well understood. Although there are only several possible mechanisms that can cause increased intracranial pressure, it is still not certain which of these mechanisms is involved. The role of imaging has significantly changed in the evaluation of patients with possible IIH. First, it is involved in ruling out secondary causes of increased intracranial pressure. In addition, there is now ample evidence that the previously held belief that imaging of patients with IIH should be normal is incorrect but rather that there are several subtle findings that radiologists need to look for. These findings include a partially empty sella, flattening of the posterior globe, cupping of optic disks and distension of the optic nerve sheaths. In addition, the role of intracranial venography is playing an ever increasing role due to the finding that a very high percentage of patients have dural venous sinus stenoses. It is becoming clear that there is potentially true morbidity associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The earlier the disease can be diagnosed, the earlier treatment can be started to minimalize permanent visual changes including blindness. Treatment varies from institution to institution due to the fact that multiple specialists with different perspectives treat these patients. Knowledge of subtle imaging features associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension can help radiologists establish the diagnosis earlier and potentially prevent complications of this disorder. However imaging has not as of yet been shown to be beneficial in managing patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Intracranial Pressure and Cerebral Hemodynamics in Infants Before and
   After Glenn Procedure
SO CRITICAL CARE EXPLORATIONS
AB OBJECTIVES:This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral hemodynamics in infants with congenital heart disease undergoing the Glenn procedure, focusing on the relationship between superior vena cava pressure and estimated ICP.DESIGN:A single-center prospective cohort study.SETTING:The study was conducted in a cardiac center over 4 years (2019-2022).PATIENTS:Twenty-seven infants with congenital heart disease scheduled for the Glenn procedure were included in the study, and detailed patient demographics and primary diagnoses were recorded.INTERVENTIONS:Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound examinations were performed at three time points: baseline (preoperatively), postoperative while ventilated (within 24-48 hr), and at discharge. TCD parameters, blood pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure were measured.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:TCD parameters included systolic flow velocity, diastolic flow velocity (dFV), mean flow velocity (mFV), pulsatility index (PI), and resistance index. Estimated ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were calculated using established formulas. There was a significant postoperative increase in estimated ICP from 11 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR], 10-16 mm Hg) to 15 mm Hg (IQR, 12-21 mm Hg) postoperatively (p = 0.002) with a trend toward higher CPP from 22 mm Hg (IQR, 14-30 mm Hg) to 28 mm Hg (IQR, 22-38 mm Hg) postoperatively (p = 0.1). TCD indices reflected alterations in cerebral hemodynamics, including decreased dFV and mFV and increased PI. Intracranial hemodynamics while on positive airway pressure and after extubation were similar.CONCLUSIONS:Glenn procedure substantially increases estimated ICP while showing a trend toward higher CPP. These findings underscore the intricate interaction between venous pressure and cerebral hemodynamics in infants undergoing the Glenn procedure. They also highlight the remarkable complexity of cerebrovascular autoregulation in maintaining stable brain perfusion under these circumstances.

TI Low-Pressure Hydrocephalus and Shunt Malfunction Following a Lumbar
   Puncture in an Adult Reversed by an Epidural Blood Patch
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is a relatively rare condition, and its presentation is similar to the classically seen high-pressure hydrocephalus, with headaches, cranial nerve dysfunction, ataxia, and disturbances of consciousness. Cerebral cerebrospinal fluid loss in the presence of altered brain viscoelastic properties has previously been suggested as the pathophysiologic process leading to ventriculomegaly, despite low or negative intracranial pressures and patent shunts. More recently, cerebral venous overdrainage has been proposed as a possible explanation in the pathogenesis of LPH, although its connection to lumbar punctures in patients with shunts has not been contemplated yet. The effectiveness of epidural blood patch in the management of post-lumbar puncture LPH has been shown in children but has not been reported in adults.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein we detail 2 episodes of shunt malfunction in a 30-year-old female patient with a history of hydrocephalus related to a posterior fossa tumor diagnosed during childhood. In both instances, imaging studies demonstrated ventricular dilation along with perimedullary cistern enlargement and brainstem distortion, which occurred following a lumbar puncture despite a patent shunt. A lumbar blood patch was effective in both episodes, enabling resolution of the ventriculomegaly and a good outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: A blood patch can be efficient in adults with post-lumbar puncture LPH. Some symptoms may be explained by brainstem compression caused by enlarged cerebrospinal fluid spaces at the skull base. The role of cerebral venous overdrainage in the setting of post-lumbar puncture LPH is further supported.

AB The main goal at the acute phase of head injury is to prevent a decrease in blood pressure, which promotes cerebral ischemia. Volume loading is therefore frequently indicated. A normal or increased plasma osmolarity should be maintained. Thus hypotonic fluids should be avoided. Hyperglycaemia is also a risk factor for brain injury and glucose use has to be restricted in the first hours after trauma. Isotonic saline 0.9% is the first solution to be infused. Lactated Ringer solutions are mildly hypotonic as approximately 114 mL of free water is contained in each litre of the solution. Isotonic colloids are indicated to replace blood losses, but have no advantage over cristalloids, concerning the development of cerebral oedema. Fluid restriction minimally affects cerebral edema. Because of the severe consequences of hypovolaemia and hypotension, fluids should not be restricted until haemodynamic stability is achieved. Hypertonic fluids rapidly restore intravascular volume and decrease intracranial pressure. Although they probably have a place in prehospital intensive therapy, the demonstration of their benefit is still lacking. Monitoring of intravascular volume is essential. Continuous arterial pressure and central venous pressure monitoring are mandatory. New monitoring techniques as the measurement of systolic pressure variations or transoesophageal Doppler echocardiophy will probably find a place in the management of trauma patients in the near future.

TI Association of post-intervention pressure gradient with symptom-free at
   6 months in idiopathic intracranial hypertension with venous sinus
   stenosis treated by stenting
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Objective This study aimed to identify the key factors that might affect the clinical outcome of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and Venous sinus stenting (VSS). Methods We performed an analysis of a prospectively collected database of patients with IIH and VSS who underwent stenting. The trans-stenotic pressure gradient was measured before and after intervention. In additional, patients' baseline characteristics, procedure details and clinical outcomes at 6-month follow-up (including changes in headache, visual impairment, papilledema, etc.) were recorded. The effects of post-intervention pressure gradient on symptom-free at 6 months were explored using logistic regression analysis, generalized additive model and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Of 101 patients included in this study, the median pressure gradient across stenosis decreased from 19 mmHg before intervention to 2 mmHg after intervention. At 6 months, symptom-free was observed in 58 cases (57.4%). Multivariable logistic analysis and generalized additive model showed that post-intervention pressure gradient (increased by 1 mmHg) was independently and linearly correlated with symptom-free (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67-0.94). Moreover, the post-intervention pressure gradient revealed moderate discrimination with an area under ROC curve of 0.68 (95% CI = 0.57-0.78). Similar associations were observed for the disappearance of headache and papilledema, but not for the visual recovery. Conclusion The post-intervention pressure gradient may be a valid and reliable predictor of 6-month clinical outcome in patients with IIH and VSS treated by stenting. Nevertheless, external validation with blinded outcome is still needed to confirm its performance before clinical application.

   Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is an uncommon presentation of neuropsychiatric SLE, In this patient several risk factors of BIH (obesity; steroid therapy, and SLE) assembled and elicited a severe presentation of the disorder which became more resistant to therapy, Several pathogenic pathways tie BIH with SLE as thrombotic obliteration of cerebral arteriolar and venous systems and immune complex deposition within the arachnoid villi (that are responsible for CSF absorption), As shown in this case report of BIH, clinical findings do not always parallel various imaging techniques as MRI and CT brain scans.

TI Pulsatile tinnitus neuroradiological diagnosis and treatment -: A review
   of 84 patients
SO RIVISTA DI NEURORADIOLOGIA
AB Pulsatile tinnitus can be annoying for a patient and also the only hint to a potentially devastating and life-threatening neurological disease. In order to better understand its clinical spectrum and management we analyzed the files of 84 patients seen at our hospital suffering from this entity.
   We reviewed the records of 84 consecutive patients with pulsatile tinnitus. The mean age was 51 years (range front 3 to 82 years, 58 women and 26 men). The evaluation of tinnitus was on average 13 months after onset. Non-invasive techniques (ultrasound, CT, MRI, MRA, First-pass-Gadolinium-MRA) and angiography were employed for work-up tailored to the individual patient. Endovascular treatment was performed using a biplane interventional angiography system (1024 x 1024 matrix) by arterial and transvenous approach.
   A vascular pathology was found in 36 (42%) patients (dural arteriovenous fistulla: 17; carotid-cavernous-fistula: 6; arteriosclerotic carotid stenosis: 7; dissection of the ICA: 5; fibromuscular dysplasia with ICA stenosis: 5; cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: 2; cerebral venous sinus stenosis: 1; ICA aneurysm: 1; abnormal loop of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery: 1). In 12 patients (14%) nonvascular pathologies such as glomus tumor or intracranial hypertension due to different reasons caused the tinnitus (paraganglioma: 5, meningioma: 1, sarcoidosis: 1, intracranial hypertension due to intracranial tumors: it, intracranial I hypertension due to aqueduct stenosis: 1).
   We conclude that patients with pulsatile tinnitus should be worked-up primarily with non-invasive techniques, e.g. first-pass gadolinium MRA, MRI and doppler sonography. If these are negative or to clarify abnormal findings further selective angiography is needed for diagnosis and treatment.

TI INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE DURING DILTIAZEM-INDUCED HYPOTENSION IN
   ANESTHETIZED DOGS
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB The effect of diltiazem-induced hypotension on intracranial pressure (ICP) was studied in dogs with normal and elevated ICP. Eight dogs were anesthetized with intravenous pentobarbital, intubated, and ventilated with N2O:O2. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), central venous pressure (CVP), and cardiac output (CO) were recorded. A ventriculostomy was performed for measurement of ICP. Baselines were established, and diltiazem was infused to reduce MAP 40 .+-. 1% for 10 min. After recording the effects of diltiazem-induced hypotension during normal ICP, ICP was elevated by infusion through a ventriculostomy cannula of pH-adjusted Ringer''s lactate, baselines were reestablished, and MAP was again reduced by 40 .+-. 1% with diltiazem. When baseline ICP was normal, diltiazem-induced hypotension produced a statistically significant increase in ICP (4.8 .+-. 0.6 mm Hg) and a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). When baseline ICP was elevated, a smaller increase in ICP occurred (1.3 .+-. 0.5 mm Hg). Although these increases in ICP were not clinically significant, the dose of diltiazem required to lower MAP 40% caused significant alterations in HR, systemic vascular resistance, CO, and PCWP. Serious cardiac rhythm disturbances occurred in five of eight dogs when baseline ICP was normal and in six of eight dogs when baseline ICP was elevated. The relatively long duration of diltiazem''s hemodynamic effect and the high incidence of cardiac rhythm disturbances make it an unsuitable drug for inducing deliberate hypotension.

TI Subacute vision loss after microvascular decompression for trigeminal
   neuralgia
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Microvascular decompression is the surgery of choice for typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN) that fails conservative medical management. Visual loss after MVD is a rare complication that has not been reported. In this article, we present a patient who developed delayed visual loss and papilledema from transverse sinus stenosis resulting from bone wax compression after MVD for TN. While waxing the edges of a retrosigmoid craniotomy may seem mundane, meticulous care should be taken to ensure that there is no compression of the venous sinuses, as this could lead to intracranial hypertension.

TI Treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension with 23.4% saline
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: To evaluate the effect of intravenous bolus administration of 23.4% saline (8008 mOsm/L) on refractory intracranial hypertension (RIH) in patients with diverse intracranial diseases.
   Design: Retrospective chart review.
   Setting: A neurosciences intensive care unit in a university hospital.
   Patients: We present eight patients and a total of 20 episodes of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) resistant to standard modes of therapy. Five patients had subarachnoid hemorrhage, one patient had traumatic brain injury, one had a brain tumor, and another had spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage. Seven patients had intraventricular catheters, and one had a subarachnoid pressure screw placed. We monitored continuously mean ICP, serum sodium concentrations, mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), central venous pressure, and urine output before and after the administration of hypertonic saline (HS). Post mortem examination of the brain was performed in two patients.
   Intervention: Intravenous bolus administration of 30 mt of 23.4% saline.
   Measurements and Main Results: There was a significant (p <.05) decrease in ICP from a median of 41.5 mm Hg before HS to 17 mm Hg at 1 hr, 16 mm Hg at 2 hrs, and 14 mm Hg at 3 hrs after HS administration. In 80% of cases, ICP decreased by >50% of the pretreatment value over a duration of 21.2 +/-: 10.3 mins. ICP decreased to <20 mm Hg in 65% of all cases and the mean time for it to again exceed 20 mm Hg was 6.3 +/- 4.9 hrs. There was a significant improvement in CPP, from 64.7+/-19 (SD) mm Hg before HS to 85.6 +/- 18 mm Hg (1 hr) and 83 +/- 18 mm Hg (3 hrs) after HS. There were no significant differences in the other variables measured. The post mortem examinations showed no white matter changes or subdural collections.
   Conclusions: This preliminary case series suggests that the intravenous bolus administration of 23.4% saline reduces ICP and augments CPP in patients with resistant increased ICP. This reduction can be maintained for several hours while other therapeutic measures are being considered. The patient population most likely to respond to this therapy needs to be further defined. Although more research is needed, this treatment is promising as a new modality for RIH because of its ICP-lowering effect without intravascular volume depletion.

TI Changes in Optic Nerve Head and Retinal Morphology During Spaceflight
   and Acute Fluid Shift Reversal
SO JAMA OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB IMPORTANCE Countermeasures that reverse the headward fluid shift experienced in weightlessness have the potential to mitigate spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome. This study investigated whether use of the countermeasure lower-body negative pressure during spaceflight was associated with changes in ocular structure.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether changes to the optic nerve head and retina during spaceflight can be mitigated by brief in-flight application of 25-mm Hg lower-body negative pressure.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICiPANTS In the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's "Fluid Shifts Study," a prospective cohort study, optical coherence tomography scans of the optic nerve head and macula were obtained from US and international crew members before flight, in-flight, and up to 180 days after return to Earth. In-flight scans were obtained both under normal weightless conditions and 10 to 20 minutes into lower-body negative pressure exposure. Preflight and postflight data were collected in the seated, supine, and head-down tilt postures. Crew members completed 6- to 12-month missions that took place on the International Space Station. Data were analyzed from 2016 to 2021.
   INTERVENTIONS OR EXPOSURES Spaceflight and lower-body negative pressure.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in minimum rim width, optic cup volume, Bruch membrane opening height, peripapillary total retinal thickness, and macular thickness.
   RESULTS Mean (SD) flight duration for the 14 crew members (mean [SD] age, 45 [6] years; 11 male crew members [79%]) was 214 (72) days. Ocular changes on flight day 150, as compared with preflight seated, included an increase in minimum rim width (33.8 mu m; 95% CI, 27.9-39.7 mu m; P < .001), decrease in cup volume (0.038 mm(3); 95% CI, 0.030-0.046 mm(3); P < .001), posterior displacement of Bruch membrane opening (-9.0 mu m; 95% CI, -15.7 to -2.2 mu m; P = .009), and decrease in macular thickness (fovea to 500 mu m, 5.1 mu m; 95% CI, 3.5-6.8 mu m; P < .001). Brief exposure to lower-body negative pressure did not affect these parameters.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this cohort study suggest that peripapillary tissue thickening, decreased cup volume, and mild central macular thinning were associated with long-duration spaceflight. Acute exposure to 25-mm Hg lower-body negative pressure did not alter optic nerve head or retinal morphology, suggesting that longer durations of a fluid shift reversal may be needed to mitigate spaceflight-induced changes and/or other factors are involved.

TI Dural sinus malformation in the early childhood: case report
SO BRAZILIAN NEUROSURGERY-ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE NEUROCIRURGIA
AB Background: Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are rare disease in pediatric age group and dural sinus malformation (DSM) has even a lower incidence rate. DSMs are associated with a mild male dominance and onset symptoms appear around 5 months of age. The most common clinical presentation is macrocrania, seizures, psychomotor delay, intracranial hemorrhage, congestive heart failure and brain ischemia. Early recognition of these lesions is essential to prevent brain injury for ischemia and intracranial hypertension. Case description: We discuss the case of a 4 month-old boy presenting with macrocrania and signs of intracranial hypertension secondary to a transverse sinus dural arteriovenous malformation. This case was successfully treated by endovascular procedure reaching the goal of the treatment that is to obliterate the arterial portion of the fistula while preserving cerebral venous drainage to reduce the pial reflux in order to prevent venous hypertension and ischemic complications.

TI Interrelation Between Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure, Intracranial
   Morphology and Venous Hemodynamics Studied by 4D Flow MRI
SO CLINICAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB PurposeTo quantify the effects of CSF pressure alterations on intracranial venous morphology and hemodynamics in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) and assess reversibility when the underlying cause is resolved.MethodsWe prospectively examined venous volume, intracranial venous blood flow and velocity, including optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) as a noninvasive surrogate of CSF pressure changes in 11 patients with IIH, 11 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls and 9 SIH patients, before and after neurosurgical closure of spinal dural leaks. We applied multiparametric MRI including 4D flow MRI, time-of-flight (TOF) and T2-weighted half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo-spin echo (HASTE).ResultsSinus volume overlapped between groups at baseline but decreased after treatment of intracranial hypotension (p = 0.067) along with a significant increase of ONSD (p = 0.003). Blood flow in the middle and dorsal superior sagittal sinus was remarkably lower in patients with higher CSF pressure (i.e., IIH versus controls and SIH after CSF leak closure) but blood flow velocity was comparable cross-sectionally between groups and longitudinally in SIH.ConclusionWe were able to demonstrate the interaction of CSF pressure, venous volumetry, venous hemodynamics and ONSD using multiparametric brain MRI. Closure of CSF leaks in SIH patients resulted in symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure and caused a subsequent decrease of intracranial venous volume and of blood flow within the superior sagittal sinus while ONSD increased. In contrast, blood flow parameters from 4D flow MRI did not discriminate IIH, SIH and controls as hemodynamics at baseline overlapped at most vessel cross-sections.

TI Brain shift is central to the pathogenesis of intracerebral haemorrhage
   remote from the site of the initial neurosurgical procedure
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB Intracerebral haemorrhage remote from the site of surgery is an uncommon and poorly understood complication after neurosurgicat procedures. Although patients under anticoagulant therapy or with perioperative elevated blood pressure are usually considered potentially at high risk of postoperative intracerebral haemorrhage, the aetiology is stilt unclear for patients without these predisposing factors. In this paper, we suggest that brain shift, unavoidably occurring during all neurosurgicat procedures, might play a central role in the aetiology of postoperative remote intracerebral haemorrhage. Brain shift is mainly caused by gravity, aggressive intraoperative dehydration, and cerebrospinal fluid aspiration. Brain shift produces stretching and transient occlusion of the corticodural bridging veins draining into the peripheral dural sinus. Consequently, venous infarcts occur in the venous; drainage territories and haemorrhagic transformation results when perfusion is re-established within ischemic tissue. To minimize brain shift and consequent risk of remote intracerebrat haemorrhage, we recommend avoiding the use of hyperosmotic agents and cerebrospinal fluid drainage systems during neurosurgicat procedures. Moderate head elevation during and immediately after surgery may improve cerebral venous drainage and reduces the risks of this life-threatening complication. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Endovascular treatment of debilitating tinnitus secondary to cerebral
   venous sinus abnormalities: a literature review and technical
   illustration
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background and objective Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) can be debilitating and lead to significant morbidity. Cerebral venous sinus lesions, such as venous sinus stenosis, diverticula, and high-riding jugular bulb, are uncommon causes of PT, for which there is no standard treatment. Endovascular interventions have shown promising results for PT secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and may be a valid therapeutic option for isolated venous PT.
   Methods We conducted a systematic literature review on the outcome and safety of endovascular treatment for patients with isolated, debilitating venous PT. The venous lesion characteristics, endovascular techniques, complications, and clinical outcomes were assessed. In addition, an illustrative case of endovascular stenting for PT caused by venous sinus stenosis was included.
   Results A total of 41 patients (90.2% female) from 26 papers were included. The median age was 46 years (IQR 23; range 25-72 years). Focal venous sinus stenosis (20 patients) and sinus diverticula (14 patients) were the most common culprit lesions. Endovascular treatment included venous sinus stenting in 35 patients, 11 of whom had adjuvant coil embolization, and coil embolization alone in six patients. Complete resolution of the tinnitus was achieved in 95.1% of patients. There was one complication of cerebellar infarct, and no procedure-related mortality.
   Conclusions In patients with debilitating PT secondary to venous sinus lesions, endovascular treatment by stenting and/or coil embolization appears to be safe and effective. Prospective randomized studies with objective outcome assessments are needed to confirm the treatment benefits.

SO NEUROLOGIA MEDICO-CHIRURGICA
AB A 1-year-old female was admitted with a subcutaneous, pulsatile soft mass in the midline parietal region, and abnormal head shape. Fundus examination showed papilledema, suggesting elevated intracranial pressure. Radiological findings showed sagittal suture craniosynostosis with sinus pericranii. Magnetic resonance venography showed that the drainage through the sinus pericranii was not essential for the venous outflow from the brain. The patient underwent surgical resection of the sinus pericranii and total cranial remodeling. Ligation of the stalk-like orifice attached to the superior sagittal sinus with resection of the sinus pericranii and total cranial reconstruction were performed concurrently. The postoperative course was uneventful, and her papilledema resolved. No recurrence of the sinus pericranii has occurred for 3 years. This case describes a unique one-staged operation to treat sinus pericranii with sagittal suture craniosynostosis.

AB 135 patients from 16 to 59 years old with benign intracranial hypertension syndrome (BIH) due to postinflammatory processes (A), venous outflow disorders (V), and endocrinological disorders (G) were investigated by CT, MRI, MRI-Ag, carotid-Ag and constant pressure infusion test. All the obtained data were analyzed and possible relationships between the parameters of CSF dynamics and the clinical data were evaluated. Correlative analysis of the obtained data was performed and the main mechanisms of compensation of BIH syndrome were established. In patients of group A disturbances of CSF absorption system with high level of CSF outflow resistance (R) and secondary elevation of brain elastance (EL) were common. In patients of this group venous disorders were of secondary nature and appeared in a later period of the disease. The patients of group V showed increased intrasinus pressure, which correlated to high R and EL. In patients of group G we found the signs of CSF hyperproduction with high level of EL. Increased R in patients of this group seemed to be a secondary reaction.
   The investigation identified the main stages of evolution and compensation of hypertension in the patients with BIH syndrome. The obtained data may be used in optimizing the conservative therapy and indications for lumboperitoneal shunting.

TI The Design of a Digital Cerebrovascular Simulation Model for Teaching
   and Research
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB BACKGROUND: We developed a comprehensive cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure model to simulate and study the complex interactions in cerebrovascular dynamics caused by multiple simultaneous alterations, including normal and abnormal functional states of autoregulation of the brain.
   METHODS: Individual published equations (derived from prior animal and human studies) were implemented into a comprehensive simulation program. Included in the normal physiological modeling was cerebral blood flow, arterial blood pressure, and carbon dioxide (CO2) partial pressure. We also added external and pathological perturbations, such as head-up position and intracranial hemorrhage.
   RESULTS: The model performed clinically realistically given inputs of published traumatized patients and cases encountered by clinicians. The pulsatile nature of the output graphics was easy for clinicians to interpret. The maneuvers simulated include changes of basic physiological inputs (e.g., arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, CO2 tension, head-up position, and respiratory effects on vascular pressures) as well as pathological inputs (e.g., acute intracranial bleeding, and obstruction of cerebrospinal outflow).
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, we believe the model would be useful to teach complex relationships of brain hemodynamics and study clinical research questions Such as the optimal head-Lip Position, the effects of intracranial hemorrhage on cerebral hemodynamics, as well as the best CO2 concentration, to reach the optimal compromise between intracranial pressure and perfusion. With the ability to vary the model's complexity, we believe it would be useful for both beginners and advanced learners. The model could also be used by practicing clinicians to model individual patients (entering the effects of needed clinical manipulations and then running the model to test for optimal combinations of therapeutic maneuvers).

TI The Promise, Mystery, and Perils of Stenting for Symptomatic Internal
   Jugular Vein Stenosis: A Case Series
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVDs) secondary to internal jugular vein (IJV) stenosis are becoming an increasingly recognized cause of significant cognitive and functional impairment in patients. There are little published data on IJV stenting for this condition. This study aims to report on procedural success.
   METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was performed on patients with CVD that underwent IJV stenting procedures.
   RESULTS: From 2019 to 2023, 29 patients with CVD underwent a total of 33 IJV stenting procedures. Most patients (20; 69%) had an underlying connective tissue disorder diagnosis. The mean age of the included patients was 36.3 years (SD 12.4), 24 were female (82.8%), and all were Caucasian except for 2 patients (27; 93.0%). Twenty-eight procedures (85%) involved isolated IJV stenting under conscious sedation, whereas 5 procedures (15%) involved IJV stenting and concomitant transverse sinus stenting under general anesthesia. Thirteen (39%) patients underwent IJV stenting after open IJV decompression and styloidectomy. Three patients had stents placed for stenosis below the C1 tubercle, one of which was for carotid compression. Periprocedural complications occurred in 11 (33%), including intracardiac stent migration in 1 patient, temporary shoulder pain/weakness in 5 (15%), and persistent and severe shoulder pain/weakness in 2 patients (6%). Approximately 75% of patients demonstrated improvement after stenting although only 12 patients (36%) had durable improvement over a mean follow-up of 4.5 months (range 6 weeks-3.5 years).
   CONCLUSION: Our experience, along with early published studies, suggests that there is significant promise to IJV revascularization techniques in these patients; however, stenting carries a high complication rate, and symptom recurrence is common. Most neurointerventionalists should not be performing IJV stenting unless they have experience with these patients and understand technical nuances (stent sizing, anatomy, patient selection), which can maximize benefit and minimize risk.

TI Long-term safety and efficacy of stenting on correcting internal jugular
   vein and cerebral venous sinus stenosis
SO ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY
AB Objectives: To compare the long-term safety and efficacy of stenting in correcting cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS) and internal jugular venous stenosis (IJVS). Methods: Patients confirmed with CVSS or IJVS by imaging were enrolled in this real-world study from 2014 through 2021. Clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of these two diseases entities post-stenting were followed up and compared. Results: Three hundred and nineteen patients were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of 48.83 years and a BMI of 25.08 on average. In which, 144 patients underwent stenting, the stenotic segments were corrected and the venous blood flow was restored immediately post-stenting. At 6.15 +/- 1.67 days follow-up, significant improvement was observed in headache, tinnitus, insomnia, ICP, and mean pressure gradient in both groups (all p < 0.05). At 30.53 +/- 4.41 months follow-up post-stenting, the headache, tinnitus, visual loss, papilledema, and insomnia were attenuated remarkably or even completely disappeared. The Frisen papilledema grade scores declined from 2 (0-4) to 1 (0-3) in IJVS group and from 4 (1-5) to 1 (0-4) in CVSS group compared to the baseline. One hundred and twenty-seven out of the 144 patients (95.5%) maintained sufficient blood flow verified by followed up computed tomographic venography or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography. Adverse events related to stenting included three cases of intraluminal restenosis and three cases of in-stent thrombosis, no intracranial hemorrhage, venous thromboembolisms, stent-adjacent stenosis, and stent displacement occurred. Interpretation: Using stents to correct IH and related neurological issues has shown to be a safe and effective approach for both IJVS and CVSS.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology, diagnosis and
   management
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by increased intracranial pressure, manifested by papilledema and radiological findings, in the absence of an identifiable casual factor. The primary symptoms include headache, vision loss, and pulsatile tinnitus, and are recognized to have profound impacts on quality of life and visual function. IIH demonstrates a strong predilection towards obese women of reproductive age, and the population incidence is rising with the growing prevalence of obesity worldwide. The pathophysiology involves dysregulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics and venous sinus pressure, and recent studies highlighting the pathogenic role of metabolic and hormonal factors have led to the identification of several pharmacological targets and development of novel ther-apeutic agents. The overarching treatment goals include symptomatic alleviation and prevention of per-manent vision loss. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial, the first of its kind randomized controlled trial on IIH, provides class I evidence for treatment with weight loss and acetazo-lamide. In medically refractive or fulminant cases, optic nerve sheath fenestration, CSF diversion, and venous sinus stenting, have been successfully implemented. However, there are few high-quality prospective studies investigating the treatment and natural history of IIH, highlighting the compelling need for further research to determine the optimal treatment regimen.

TI Traumatic bilateral jugular vein thrombosis: Case report and review of
   the literature
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Thrombosis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) with associated elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a rare complication of central venous catheterization but has not been reported as a result of blunt trauma.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old male patient was observed to be obtunded after an assault, The initial examination was remarkable for somnolence, bruising of the anterior neck, and diffuse, edematous swelling of the face and scalp, The results of computed tomography of the brain were normal. An angiogram obtained on the 2nd hospital day to rule out carotid injury revealed bilateral IJV thromboses to the cranial base. An ICP monitor was placed with an opening pressure of 33 mm Hg. The central venous pressure was measured to be 9 mm Hg. A catheter was passed through the left IJV thrombus and into the sigmoid sinus, where the pressure was 17 mm Hg,
   INTERVENTION: An intravascular stent was deployed in the left IJV. ICP rapidly normalized. A regimen of coumadin was administered to the patient for 6 weeks, at which time the stent remained patent.
   CONCLUSION: We conclude that traumatic jugular vein thrombosis can be associated with significant elevation in ICP and that treatment with an endovascular stent can affect the rapid correction of intracranial hypertension in patients who are candidates for anticoagulation.

TI Computer simulation of cerebrovascular circulation: Assessment of
   intracranial hemodynamics during induction of anesthesia
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING
AB Objective. The purpose of this project was to develop a computer model of cerebrovascular hemodynamics interacting with a pharmacokinetic drug model to examine the effects of various stimuli on cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure during anesthesia. Methods. The mathematical model of intracranial hemodynamics is a seven-compartment, constant-volume system. A series of resistances relate blood and cerebrospinal fluid fluxes to pressure gradients between compartments. Arterial, venous, and tissue compliance are also included. Autoregulation is modeled by transmural pressure-dependent, arterial-arteriolar resistance. The effect of a drug (thiopental) on cerebrovascular circulation was simulated by a variable arteriolar-capillary resistance. Thiopental concentration was predicted by a three-compartment, pharmacokinetic model. The effect site compartment was included to account for a disequilibrium between drug plasma and biophase concentrations. The model was validated by comparing simulation results with available experimental observations. The simulation program is written in VisSim(R) dynamic simulation language for an IBM-compatible PC. Results. The model developed was used to calculate the cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure changes that occur during the induction phase of general anesthesia. Responses to laryngoscopy and intubation were predicted for simulated patients with elevated intracranial pressure and non-autoregulated cerebral circulation. Simulation shows that the induction dose of thiopental reduces intracranial pressure up to 15%. The duration of this effect is limited to less than 3 minutes by rapid redistribution of thiopental and cerebral autoregulation. Subsequent laryngoscopy causes acute intracranial hypertension, exceeding the initial intracranial pressure. Further simulation predicts that this untoward effect can be minimized by an additional dose of thiopental administered immediately Frier to intubation. Conclusion. The presented simulation allows comparison of various drug administration schedules to control intracranial pressure and preserve cerebral blood flow during induction of anesthesia. The model developed can be extended to analyze more complex intraoperative events by adding new submodels.

TI Transverse venous sinus stenting for idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension: Safety and feasibility
SO NEURORADIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Purpose: Transverse sinus stenosis is commonly seen in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. It is not clear whether it is the cause or the result of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been carried out in several prior series. Our goal was to evaluate the clinical and imaging follow-up results of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension that underwent stenting for this condition at our center.
   Materials and Methods: We reviewed the clinical, venographic and follow-up imaging data in patients who underwent elective transverse sinus stenting during the period from 2011 to 2017.
   Results: In total, 18 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension were identified. The mean lumbar cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure recorded was 408 mmH20. Overall, 16 patients met the inclusion criteria and underwent transverse sinus stenting. At venography, the mean pressure gradient across the dominant transverse sinus stenosis was 21mmHg. The pressure gradient immediately after stenting in all of those measured was negligible. Following stenting, headaches improved in 10 of the 16 cases, with persistent headaches in four patients, one of which had persistent baseline migraines. All cases showed resolution of the papilledema on follow up. Follow-up imaging with computed tomography venography showed that the stents remained widely patent. The follow up in clinic was done for a mean period of 35.5 months. Follow up with computed tomography venography was done for a mean of 10.3 months.
   Conclusion: Venous sinus stenting is a safe and effective procedure. It relieves papilledema in all cases and improves headaches in most cases.

TI A rare case of spontaneous otogenic pneumocephalus with pictorial
   illustration of temporal evolution
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Pneumocephalus is commonly seen on imaging in the setting of craniofacial trauma, skull base tumours, intracranial infection and after neurological intervention. Spontaneous pneumocephalus in the absence of these conditions is exceedingly rare, with only approximately 30 cases reported in the literature to date. Spontaneous otogenic pneumocephalus (SOP) is believed to occur as a result of anomalous commu-nication between the intracranial space and a hyper-pneumatised temporal bone, with either positive extra-to-intracranial pressure or negative intracranial pressure gradient. These anomalous communicat-ing channels may only become clinically apparent when triggered by episodes of acute increase in middle ear pressure during coughing, sneezing, Valsalva manoeuvre or significant change in atmospheric pres -sure. Patients may exhibit a wide range of neurological symptoms and the aim of treatment is to reduce the risk of complications such as infection and intracranial hypertension. Both conservative and neuro-surgical approaches have been described. We report a case of SOP in which the patient was conserva-tively managed, and spontaneous resolution of pneumocephalus was documented on serial computed tomography (CT) scans. This unique case clearly demonstrates the natural history and temporal evolution of SOP without surgical intervention. This knowledge may potentially obviate the need for surgery, thus reducing morbidity and mortality in patients who are poor surgical candidates.

TI Characteristics of Recurrent Congenital Sinus Pericranii: Case Report
   and Review of the Literature
SO PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY
AB Introduction: Sinus pericranii (SP) involves transosseous vessels that connect the intra- and extracranial venous systems. Accessory-type SP can be cured by surgical or endovascular treatment. Reports of recurrence are, however, rare. Case: A boy presented with a soft-tissue mass on the left parietal region of the head. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the congenital SP with several small transosseous vessels surrounded by an area of thin bone. At the initial surgery, the vascular mass was completely excised by coagulating and cutting the transosseous vessels. The skull defect was filled with bone wax. Two years later, SP recurred at the same site. At the second surgery, the skull defect and surrounding area were sealed with acrylic resin. The boy has been followed up for 6 years without recurrence. Discussion: Potential risk factors for recurrence proposed in the existing literature include an unusually large number of emissary veins, rich circulation between intra- and extracranial venous systems, large bone defects, raised intracranial pressure, and association of other developmental venous anomalies. Our case demonstrates that thin skull bone around the original lesion can be another risk factor for recurrence. Conclusion: Removing all abnormal vessels and sealing the skull defect as well as the surrounding thin bone area are important to prevent recurrence of congenital SP.

TI Resection of the transverse sinuses and confluence of sinuses for
   treatment of multiple dural arteriovenous fistulas
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) occurring simultaneously at two or more separate locations are not frequent. In fact, the incidence of multiple DAVFs is 7 to 8% of all DAVFs. Patients harboring multiple DAVFs have a higher incidence of hemorrhage, venous infarction, and neurological deficits due to a greater frequency of leptomeningeal venous drainage. To the authors' knowledge only a few cases of DAVFs involving both transverse sinuses (TSs) have been reported. These patients underwent various combined treatments (transarterial embolization, transvenous obliteration, surgical isolation, resection, and radiosurgery). Treatments performed that do not include resection of the involved sinuses do not always guarantee a cure. The authors present a patient who harbored multiple DAVFs of the TSs, both distally occluded with secondary reflux into the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), the straight sinus, the deep venous system, and the leptomeningeal veins of both hemispheres. An en bloc removal of the portions including the fistulas of the TSs, the confluence of sinuses, and the distal parts of the SSS, and straight sinus allowed for the patient to be cured. The fact is emphasized that despite the progress of endovascular treatment and radiosurgery this kind of DAVF must be surgically treated. The operation may be complex and dangerous.

TI Reverse brain herniation during posterior fossa surgery
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Posterior fossa tumors are commonly associated with obstructive hydrocephalus. Relieving the raised intracranial pressure by draining the cerebrospinal fluid presents the possibility of reverse herniation of the brain. A 5-year-old male child with a diagnosis of posterior fossa space-occupying lesion and hydrocephalus was scheduled for craniectomy in the prone position. After craniectomy, the surgeons placed an intraventricular shunt catheter to drain out cerebrospinal fluid in an attempt to reduce the tense brain so as to facilitate easy dissection of the tumor. The patient had sudden and severe bradycardia followed by asystole. A diagnosis of reverse coning was made. Immediately, the surgeon injected 10-15 mL normal saline into the ventricles. There was a spontaneous return of the sinus rhythm and the rest of the course of surgery was uneventful. We present this case showing a rare phenomenon and its successful management.

TI The entire dural sinus tree is compressed in patients with idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension: a longitudinal, volumetric magnetic resonance
   imaging study
SO NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Introduction The objective of this study was to explore the volumetric alterations of dural sinuses in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
   Methods Standardized cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in 17 patients prior to and following treatment of IIH and in seven controls. Magnetic resonance venographies (MRV) were employed for (a) judgement of circumscript dural sinus stenoses and (b) computation of sinus volumes. Cross-sectional areas (CSA) of the superior sagittal sinuses (SSS) were measured on T2-weighted images. Results of the initial MRIs were compared to those on follow-up MRIs and to results of controls.
   Results Stenoses of the transverse sinuses (TS) resulting in cranial venous outflow obstruction (CVOO) were present in 15/17 (88%) patients, normalizing in 7/15 cases (47%) after treatment of IIH. CVOO was not detected in the control group. Segmentation of MRV revealed decreased dural sinus volumes in patients with IIH as compared to controls (P = 0.018). Sinus volumes increased significantly with normalization of intracranial pressure independent from disappearing of TS stenoses (P = 0.007). The CSA of the SSS were normal on the initial MRIs of patients with IIH and increased on follow-up after treatment (P < 0.001). However, volumetries displayed overlap in patients and controls.
   Conclusions Patients with IIH not only exhibit bilateral stenoses of the TS as has been reported, but volume changes of their entire dural sinus system also occur. The potential etiopathological and diagnostic roles of these changes are discussed.

AB In this study the hemodynamic status and treatment modality of aggressive dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) was evaluated.
   Of 145 intracranial dAVFs treated in our clinic, there were 38 aggressive lesions presenting with hemorrhage, infarction, seizures, and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. They included 3 (5% of all cavernous sinus lesions) cavernous sinus, 24 (44%) transverse-sigmoid and superior sagittal sinus, and 11 (46%) direct cortical types of dAVFs.
   Of these 38 aggressive lesions, retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage was disclosed in 35 lesions, and retrograde sinus drainage in 3. Eighteen cases were treated only with endovascular procedures, 7 with surgical interventions, and 13 with combined endovascular and surgical procedures. Angiographic results were complete obliteration in 66% of the cases, subtotal and partial obliteration in 34%. Clinical outcome was GR (good recovery) in 58% of cases, MD (moderate disability) in 18%, SD (severe disability) in 13%, VS (vegetative state) in 8%, and D (death) (due to acute cardiac infarction) in 3%. Symptomatic procedural complication occurred in 3 cases.
   In conclusion, aggressive dural AVF resulted from retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage. Combined surgical and endovascular treatment played the leading part in the management of this aggressive type of lesion.

   Methods: Of the 77 patients who underwent a lumbar puncture, 27 were excluded secondary to a history of glaucoma, using drugs effective on IOP, and abnormal funduscopic examination. ICP was measured by lumbar puncture. lop was measured by two scales of Schiotz tonometer in both eyes, and the mean was calculated.
   Results: We found a significant correlation between ICP and mean IOP (p < 0.001; r = 0.955). Body mass index, age, and disease type had no significant effect on this correlation.
   Interpretation: IOP is correlated with ICP.

TI Miniaturized mechanical chest compressor improves calculated cerebral
   perfusion pressure without compromising intracranial pressure during
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a porcine model of cardiac arrest
SO RESUSCITATION
AB Objective: One of the major goals of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is to provide adequate oxygen delivery to the brain for minimizing cerebral injury resulted from cardiac arrest. The optimal chest compression during CPR should effectively improve brain perfusion without compromising intracranial pressure (ICP). Our previous study has demonstrated that the miniaturized mechanical chest compressor improved hemodynamic efficacy and the success of CPR. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the miniaturized chest compressor (MCC) on calculated cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP) and ICP.
   Methods: Ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced and untreated for 7 min in 13 male domestic pigs weighing 39 +/- 3 kg. The animals were randomized to receive mechanical chest compression with the MCC (n = 7), or the Thumper device (n = 6). CPR was performed for 5 min before defibrillation attempt by a single 150 J shock. At 2.5 min of CPR, the epinephrine at a dose of 20 mu g/kg was administered. Additional epinephrine was administered at an interval of 3 min thereafter. If resuscitation was not successful, CPR was resumed for an additional 2 min prior to the next defibrillation until successful resuscitation or for a total of 15 min. Post-resuscitated animals were observed for 2 h.
   Results: Significantly greater intrathoracic positive and negative pressures during compression and decompression phases of CPR were observed with the MCC when compared with the Thumper device. The MCC produced significantly greater coronary perfusion pressure and end-tidal carbon dioxide. There were no statistically significant differences in systolic and mean ICP between the two groups; however, both of the measurements were slightly greater in the MCC treated animals. Interestingly, the diastolic ICP was significantly lower in the MCC group, which was closely related to the significantly lower negative intrathoracic pressure in the animals that received the MCC. Most important, systolic, diastolic and mean calculated CerPP were all significantly greater in the animals receiving the MCC.
   Conclusions: In the present study, mechanical chest compression with the MCC significantly improved calculated CerPP but did not compromise ICP during CPR. It may provide a safe and effective chest compression during CPR.

TI Intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure responses to head
   elevation changes in pediatric traumatic brain injury
SO PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objectives: To determine the effect of and dynamic interaction between head elevation on intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure in severe pediatric traumatic head injury.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, interventional cohort study.
   Setting: Two tertiary pediatric critical care referral units.
   Patients: Ten children admitted with severe traumatic brain injury defined as Glasgow Coma Score <= 8 necessitating intracranial pressure monitoring (10 yrs +/- 5 SD; range 2-16 yrs).
   Interventions: Head elevation was randomly increased or decreased between 0 and 40 degrees from baseline level (30 degrees) in increments or decrements of 10 degrees.
   Measurements and Main Results: Intracranial pressure and arterial blood pressure were continuously recorded in combination with time-stamped clinical notations. Data were available for analysis in eight subjects (seven males and one female; mean age, 10 yrs +/- SD 5; range, 2-16 yrs) during 18 protocol sessions. This resulted in a total of 66 head-of-the-bed challenges. To compare results for a given change in head-of-the-bed elevation across age, we transformed head-of-the-bed angle to change in height (cm) at the level of Monro's foramen. An increase in head elevation of 10 cm resulted in an average change in intracranial pressure of -3.9 mm Hg (SD +/- 3.2 mm Hg; p < .001), whereas cerebral perfusion pressure remained unchanged (0.1 +/- 5.6 mm Hg; p = .957). Individual subjects showed marked variability in intracranial pressure change (range, -8.4 to +1.9 mm Hg/10 cm). The overall regression analysis for intracranial pressure response was change in intracranial pressure = -0.39/cm Delta h, r(2) = 0.42, and p < .001, where Delta h is the change in vertical height at the level of foramen of Monro attributable to a change in the head of the bed.
   Conclusions: In severe pediatric traumatic brain injury, the relationship between change in head of the bed and change in intracranial pressure was negative and linear. The lowest intracranial pressure was usually, but not always, achieved at highest head-of-the-bed angles. The effect size of a head-of-the-bed angle change depended, in part, on the subject's height. In contrast, cerebral perfusion pressure was mostly unaffected by head-of-the-bed changes. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2012; 13:e39-e47)

TI Dural venous sinus stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension: An
   updated review
SO JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Background. - Dural venous sinus stenting (DVSS) is an accepted treatment option in selected patients with medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension and obstructive venous outflow physiology prior to cerebrospinal flow diversion (CSFD) surgery. There are no randomized controlled studies focusing on outcomes and complication rates for dural venous sinus stenting.
   Purpose. - We present the largest comprehensive meta-analysis on DVSS for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) focusing on success rates, complications, and re-stenting rates to date. We also present a simplified approach to direct retrograde internal jugular vein (IJ) access for DVSS that allows for expedited procedures.
   Materials and methods. - We performed a retrospective electronic PubMed query of all peer-reviewed articles in the last 15 years between 2003 to 2018. We included all patients who underwent dural venous sinus stenting for a medically refractive IIH and excluded articles without sufficient data on outcomes, complication rates and re-stenting rates. We also evaluated and compared outcomes in patients undergoing direct retrograde II access DVSS to traditional transfemoral vein access.
   Results. - A total of 29 papers and 410 patients who underwent DVSS met criteria for inclusion. DVSS was associated with high technical success [99.596], low rates of repeated procedure [10%], and low major complication rates [1.5%].
   Conclusion. - Our retrospective comprehensive review of DVSS for medically refractory IIH suggests that stenting in appropriately chosen patients is associated with low complication rates, high technical success, and low repeat procedure rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Use of hypertonic saline in the treatment of severe refractory
   posttraumatic intracranial hypertension in pediatric traumatic brain
   injury
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objectives: To evaluate the effect of prolonged infusion of 3% hypertonic saline (514 mEq/L) and sustained hypernatremia on refractory intracranial hypertension in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients.
   Design: A prospective study.
   Setting: a 24-bed Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (Level III) at Children's Hospital.
   Patients: We present ten children with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) resistant to conventional therapy (head elevation at 30 degrees, normothermia, sedation, paralysis and analgesia, osmolar therapy with mannitol, loop diuretic, external vertricular drainage in five patients), controlled hyperventilation (PCO2, 28-35 mm Hg), and barbiturate coma. We continuously monitored ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, serum sodium concentrations, serum osmolarity, and serum creatinine.
   Interventions: A continuous infusion of 3% saline on a sliding scale was used to achieve a target serum sodium level that would maintain ICP <20 mm Hg once the conventional therapy and barbiturate coma as outlined above failed to control intracranial hypertension.
   Measurements and Main Results: The mean duration of treatment with 3% saline was 7.6 days (range, 4-18 days). The mean highest serum sodium was 170.7 mEq/L (range, 157-187 mEq/L). The mean highest serum osmolarity was 364.8 mosm/L (range, 330-431 mosm/L). The mean highest serum creatinine was 1.31 mg/dL (range, 0.4-5.0 mg/dL). There was a steady increase in serum sodium versus time zero that reached statistical significance at 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). There was a statistically significant decrease in ICP spike frequency at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). There was a statistically significant increase in CPP versus time zero at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). There was a statistically significant increase in serum osmolarity versus time zero at 12 hrs (p < .05) and at 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01). Two patients developed acute renal failure and required continuous veno-venous hemodialysis; these were concurrent with an episode of sepsis and multisystem organ dysfunction. Both recovered full renal function with no electrolyte abnormalities at the time of discharge.
   Conclusion: An increase in serum sodium concentration significantly decreases ICP and increases CPP. Hypertonic saline is an effective agent to increase serum sodium concentrations. Sustained hypernatremia and hyperosmolarity are safely tolerated in pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury. Controlled trials are needed before recommendation of widespread use.

TI Endovascular treatment of a grade IV transverse sinus dural
   arteriovenous fistula by sinus recanalization, angioplasty, and stent
   placement: Technical case report
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The frequent association of dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVFs) and dural sinus thrombosis may render the treatment of these complex lesions difficult. We report a case of DAVF eradicated by recanalization of the chronically thrombosed transverse sinus (TS) and sigmoid sinus followed by balloon angioplasty and stent deployment at the site of the fistula.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old man presented with a Type IV DAVF of the left TS with widespread white matter changes secondary to venous hypertension. Arterial feeders arose from the left internal carotid, external carotid, and vertebral arteries. The distal segment of the left TS, the left sigmoid sinus, and the proximal segment of the right TS were occluded. Reverse flow was observed in the deep venous system and in the superior sagittal sinus.
   INTERVENTION: Endovascular access was gained through the left internal jugular vein. Mechanical recanalization of the thrombosed left TS and sigmoid sinus was followed by balloon angioplasty and placement of six overlapping stents extending from the TS to the proximal internal jugular vein. Angiograms performed after surgery showed resaturation of antegrade venous drainage as well as complete eradication of the fistulous connections. The patient was discharged with an improving clinical status.
   CONCLUSION: Recanalization of a chronically occluded dural venous sinus through a jugular approach is feasible. In addition to eradicating cerebral venous hypertension by reestablishing antegrade venous drainage, balloon angioplasty and stent deployment at the DAVF site produced complete closure of the fistula. This may prove to be a new therapeutic strategy for management of DAVF.

TI Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: A Systematic Analysis of
   Transverse Sinus Stenting
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEUROLOGY
AB Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder characterized by signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure without structural cause seen on conventional imaging. Hallmark treatment after failed medical management has been CSF shunting or optic nerve fenestration with the objective of preserving vision. Recently, there have been multiple case reports and case series on dural sinus stenting for this disorder. Objective: We aim to review all published cases and case series of dural sinus stenting for IIH, with analysis of patients' presenting symptoms, objective findings (CSF pressures, papilledema, pressure gradients across dural sinuses), follow-up of objective findings, and complications. Methods: A Medline search was performed to identify studies meeting prespecified criteria of a case report or case series of patients treated with dural sinus stent placement for IIH. The papers were reviewed and data were extracted. Results: A total of 22 studies were identified, of which 19 studies (including a total of 207 patients) met the criteria and were included in the analysis. Only three major complications related to the procedure were identified. Headaches resolved or improved in 81% of patients. Papilledema improved in 90% of cases (172 of 189 patients). Sinus pressure decreased from an average of 30.3 to 15 mm Hg. Sinus pressure gradient decreased from 18.5 mm Hg (n = 185) to 3.2 mm Hg (n = 172). Stenting had an overall symptom improvement rate of 87%. Conclusion: Although all published case reports and case series are nonrandomized, the low complication and high symptom improvement rate make dural sinus stenting for IIH a potential alternative surgical treatment. Standardized patient selection and randomization trials or registry are warranted. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI Improvement of exhausted cerebral autoregulation in patients with
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension benefit of venous sinus stenting
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT
AB Objective. To evaluate the cerebral autoregulation (CA) in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients with transfer function analysis, and to explore its improvement after venous sinus stenting. Approach. In total, 15 consecutive IIH patients with venous sinus stenosis and 15 controls were recruited. All the patients underwent digital subtraction angiography and venous manometry. Venous sinus stenting was performed for IIH patients with a trans-stenosis pressure gradient >= 8 mmHg. CA was assessed before and after the operation with transfer function analysis, by using the spontaneous oscillations of the cerebral blood flow velocity in the bilateral middle cerebral artery and blood pressure. Main results. Compared with controls, the autoregulatory parameters, phase shift and rate of recovery, were both significantly lower in IIH patients [(57.94 degrees +/- 23.22 degrees versus 34.59 degrees +/- 24.15 degrees, p < 0.001; (39.87 +/- 21.95) %/s versus (20.56 +/- 46.66) %/s, p = 0.045, respectively). In total, six patients with bilateral transverse or sigmoid sinus stenosis received venous sinus stenting, in whom, the phase shift significantly improved after venous sinus stenting (39.62 degrees +/- 20.26 degrees versus 22.79 degrees +/- 19.96 degrees, p = 0.04). Significance. The study revealed that dynamic CA was impaired in IIH patients and was improved after venous sinus stenting. CA assessment has the potential to be used for investigating the hemodynamics in IIH patients.

TI Intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome
SO LANGENBECKS ARCHIVES OF SURGERY
AB Background: The effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure in various organ systems have been noted over the past century. The concept of abdominal compartment syndrome has gained more attention in both trauma and general surgery in the last decade. This article reviews the current understanding and management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, Methods: Relevant information was gathered from a Medline search of the English literature, previous review and original articles, references cited in papers, and by checking the latest issues of appropriate journals. Results and conclusion: Akin to compartment syndrome in extremities, the pathophysiological effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure developed well before any clinical evidence of compartment syndrome. These effects include cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal and intracranial derangement, reduction of intestinal and hepatic blood flow, and reduction of abdominal wall compliance. Although abdominal compartment syndrome is more commonly noted in patients with abdominal trauma, it is now evident that non-trauma surgical patients could also develop the condition. Early initiation of treatment for intra-abdominal hypertension is currently advocated in view of the possibility of subclinical progress to the full-blown abdominal compartment syndrome.

   Society-of-American-Gastrointestinal-Endoscopic-Surgeons (SAGES)
CY MAR 24-27, 1999
CL SAN ANTONIO, TX
SP Soc Amer Gastrointestinal Endoscop Surg
AB Background: Although many aspects of laparoscopic surgery have been determined, the question of which insufflation gas is the best arises repeatedly. The aim of this study was to review the findings on the major gases used today in order to provide information and guidelines for the laparoscopic surgeon.
   Methods: We reviewed the literature for clinical and laboratory studies on the currently used laparoscopic insufflation gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), helium (He), air, nitrogen (N-2), and argon (Ar). The following parameters were evaluated: acid-base changes, hemodynamic and respiratory sequelae, hepatic and renal blood flow changes, increase in intracranial pressure, outcome of venous emboli, and port-site tumor growth.
   Results: The major advantage of CO2 is its rapid dissolution in the event of venous emboli. Hemodynamic and acid-base changes with CO2 insufflation usually are mild and clinically negligible for most patients. Although N2O is advantageous for procedures requiring local/regional anesthesia, it does not suppress combustion. Findings show that Ar may have unwanted hemodynamic effects, especially on hepatic blood flow. There are almost no hemodynamic or acid-base sequelae with the use of He, air, and N-2, but they dissolve slowly and carry a potential risk of lethal venous emboli.
   Conclusions: Clearly, CO2 maintains its role as the primary insufflation gas in laparoscopy, but N2O has a role in some cases of depressed pulmonary function or in local/regional anesthesia cases. Other gases have no significant advantage over CO2 or N2O and should be used only in protocol studies. The relation of port-site metastasis to a specific type of gas requires further research.

TI IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION IN A PAEDIATRIC POPULATION: A
   RETROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY ON EPIDEMIOLOGY, SYMPTOMS AND
   TREATMENT
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL REGULATORS AND HOMEOSTATIC AGENTS
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder of unknown origin, which is characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) without underlying etiological evidence of neurological disease. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate epidemiological features, clinical presentation, diagnostic findings and treatment of sixteen children (7 males and 9 females) with IIH. Medical records of the patients were obtained from the University Paediatric Hospital of Catania, Italy. Clinical features, investigations and treatment approaches were retrieved. The mean age of the sixteen children at onset of symptoms was 9 years (range: 4 to 16 years). Most of the patients were classified as pre-pubertal. Mean BMI was 28.9 kg/m(2). In 93.75% of patients headache was the presenting clinical symptom; and in the same percentage papilledema was detected as the accompanied sign during diagnostic flow-chart. The mean lumbar puncture opening pressure (LPOP) was 350 mm H2O. Fifty percent of the cases had normal brain imaging, while 12.5% showed enlarged optic nerve diameter and one patient had an intraocular protrusion of the optic nerve on MRI. Two patients (12.5%) had venous sinus stenosis, and one case showed an abnormal spinal MRI. With regard to therapeutic approaches, 93.75% of the cases were successfully treated with Acetazolamide. None of the patients required surgical procedures, and all neuroimaging findings disappeared after receiving treatment. In the present study we investigated the association of IIH with venous sinus stenosis. We also found ocular ultrasound to be a useful non-invasive alternative method for determining papilledema in paediatric IIH, specifically in an emergency setting.

TI Design and implementation of a portable physiologic data acquisition
   system
SO PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: To describe and report the reliability of a portable, laptop-based, real-time, continuous physiologic data acquisition system (PDAS) that allows for synchronous recording of physiologic data, clinical events, and event markers at the bedside for physiologic research studies in the intensive care unit.
   Design: Descriptive report of new research technology.
   Setting: Adult and pediatric intensive care units in three tertiary care academic hospitals.
   Patients: Sixty-four critically ill and injured patients were studied, including 34 adult (22 males and 12 females) and 30 pediatric (19 males and 11 females).
   Interventions. None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Data transmission errors during bench and field testing were measured. The PDAS was used in three separate research studies, by multiple users, and for repeated recordings of the same set of signals at various intervals for different lengths of time.
   Both parametric (1 Hz) and waveform (125-500 Hz) signals were recorded and analyzed. Details of the PDAS components are explained and examples are given from the three experimental physiology-based protocols. Waveform data include electrocardiogram, respiration, systemic arterial pressure (invasive and noninvasive), oxygen saturation, central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, left and right atrial pressures, intracranial pressure, and regional cerebral blood flow. Bench and field testing of the PDAS demonstrated excellent reliability with 100% accuracy and no data transmission errors. The key feature of simultaneously capturing physiologic signal data and clinical events (e.g., changes in mechanical ventilation, drug administration, clinical condition) is emphasized.
   Conclusions: The PDAS provides a reliable tool to record physiologic signals and associated clinical events on a second-to-second basis and may serve as an important adjunctive research tool in designing and performing clinical physiologic studies in critical illness and injury.

TI A Case of Terson-Like Syndrome in a Patient with Viral
   Meningoencephalitis
SO CASE REPORTS IN OPHTHALMOLOGICAL MEDICINE
AB The proposed mechanism of Terson's syndrome is increased intracranial pressure that leads to dilation of the retrobulbar optic nerve and compression of the central retinal vein. Terson's syndrome has been associated with many conditions that increase intracranial pressure such as venous sinus thrombosis, Moyamoya disease, leukemia, direct head trauma, and intraocular hemorrhage related to shaken baby syndrome. We present a novel case of a patient with recent viral prodrome found to have papilledema and multilayered retinal hemorrhages consistent with Terson syndrome. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance venography of the brain did not reveal any subdural, subarachnoid, or intracranial hemorrhages. However, cerebrospinal fluid analyses were significant for increased opening pressure and elevated protein levels, which were suggestive of viral meningoencephalitis. We describe this case as a Terson-like syndrome because the etiology of intraocular hemorrhage is increased intracranial pressure. However, this case does not fit the traditional presentation of Terson's syndrome as the intracranial pressure is secondary to meningeal inflammation instead of subdural, subarachnoid, or intracranial hemorrhage. We strongly feel that it is important for physicians to be aware of the link between viral meningoencephalitis and retinal conditions such as Terson-like syndrome because it can facilitate rapid diagnosis and treatment.

TI Technical and clinical success after venous sinus stenting for treatment
   of idiopathic intracranial hypertension using a novel guide catheter for
   access: Case series and initial multi-center experience
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Introduction Venous sinus stenting is a well established alternative to cerebrospinal fluid diversion for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with associated venous sinus stenosis. During this procedure, distal guide catheter placement within the venous sinuses may be desirable to facilitate stent delivery. We report our initial experience using the TracStar LDP (TM) (Imperative Care, Campbell, USA, 0.088-inch inner diameter) as the guide catheter for intracranial access during venous sinus stenting. Methods A multi-institutional retrospective chart review of a prospectively maintained IRB-approved database was performed. Consecutive patients who underwent venous sinus stenting from 1/1/2020-9/6/2021 for IIH were included. Patient characteristics, procedural details, TracStar distal reach, outcomes, and complications were collected and analyzed. Results Fifty-eight patients were included. The mean age was 33.8 years and 93.1% of patients were female. Visual changes prompted evaluation in 86.2% of patients. Stent placement was successful in all patients. The TracStar LDP catheter was advanced to the location of stent placement in 97.9% of cases in which it was attempted. The large 0.088-inch inner diameter lumen enabled compatibility with all desired stent sizes ranging from six to 10 millimeters. Gradient pressure across transverse sinus stenosis dropped from an average of 19.5 mmHg pre-procedure to 1.7 mmHg post-stent placement (p < 0.001). Clinical improvement was achieved in 87.9% (51/58) of patients. There were no catheter-related complications. Conclusion The TracStar LDP is a safe and effective access platform for reaching treatment locations in patients who present with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and who are candidates for venous sinus stent placement.

TI Clinical outcomes after stenting treatment in patients with idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension and intrinsic versus extrinsic venous sinus
   stenosis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Endovascular stenting is a promising treatment for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and venous sinus stenosis (VSS). However, data on the impact of stenosis type on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing stenting treatment remain limited. This prospective cohort study aimed to compare post-stenting outcomes in patients with IIH and intrinsic versus extrinsic VSS.Methods Patients with IIH and VSS undergoing stenting at a tertiary hospital in China were enrolled consecutively from 2017 to 2023. Based on digital subtraction angiography, high-resolution MRI, and intravascular ultrasound findings, patients were categorized into two groups: intrinsic or extrinsic stenosis. At 6 months post-stenting, clinical outcomes including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, headache, visual impairment, and papilledema were recorded. Multivariable regression models were used to explore the relationship between stenosis type and clinical outcomes.Results In total, 92 patients were included, 60 with intrinsic stenosis and 32 with extrinsic stenosis. At 6 months, the intrinsic group had lower CSF pressure (median 180 vs 210 mmH2O, beta coefficient -31.8, 95% CI -54.0 to -9.6) and a higher rate of complete symptom resolution (81.7% vs 40.6%, OR 8.88, 95% CI 2.60 to 30.30) than the extrinsic group. Additionally, 36.8% (95% CI 10.5% to 77.2%) of the effect of stenosis type on complete symptom resolution at 6 months was mediated through reduction in CSF pressure.Conclusion This single-center study suggested that patients with IIH and intrinsic VSS had lower CSF pressure and better symptom recovery compared with those with extrinsic VSS at 6 months post-stenting. Further validation in other centers and populations is needed.Trial registration number ChiCTR.org.cn, ChiCTR-ONN-17010421.

TI Cerebro-pulmonary interactions during the application of low levels of
   positive end-expiratory pressure
SO INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: In patients with severe brain injury and acute lung injury the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is limited by conflicting results on its effect on intracranial pressure. We hypothesised that the occurrence of alveolar hyperinflation during the application of PEEP would lead to an increase in PaCO2 responsible for a rise in intracranial pressure. Design: Prospective interventional study. Setting: Intensive Care Unit of University Hospitals. Patients and participants: Twelve severely brain-injured patients with acute lung injury and intracranial pressure higher than applied PEEP. Interventions: 5 and 10 cmH(2)O of PEEP was randomly applied. Measurements and results: In all patients intracranial pressure, flow velocity by transcranial Doppler of middle cerebral artery, and jugular oxygen saturation were recorded. Static volume-pressure curves of the respiratory system were obtained, recruited volume and elastance calculated to classify patients as recruiters and non-recruiters. In recruiters (= 6 patients), elastance decreased (P < 0.01) and PaO2 increased (P < 0.005), while in non-recruiters (= 6 patients) elastance and PaCO2 significantly increased (P < 0.001). Intracranial pressure, Doppler flow velocity, and jugular saturation remained constant in recruiters but significantly increased (P < 0.0001) in non-recruiters. A significant correlation was found between changes in intracranial pressure and elastance (r(2) = 0.8 P < 0.0001) and between changes in PaCO2 and intracranial pressure (P < 0.001, r(2) = 0.4) and elastance (P < 0.001, r(2) = 0.4), respectively. Conclusions: When PEEP induced alveolar hyperinflation leading to a significant increase in PaCO2, intracranial pressure significantly increased, whereas when PEEP caused alveolar recruitment intracranial pressure did not change.

TI A New Perspective on the Pathophysiology of Idiopathic Intracranial
   Hypertension: Role of the Glia-Neuro-Vascular Interface
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neurological disease characterized by symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) of unknown cause. Most attention has been given to the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) disturbance and intracranial venous hypertension caused by sinus vein stenosis. We previously proposed that key pathophysiological processes take place within the brain at the glia-neuro-vascular interface. However, the relative importance of the proposed mechanisms in IIH disease remains unknown. Modern treatment regimens aim to reduce intracranial CSF and venous pressures, but a substantial proportion of patients experience lasting complaints. In 2010, the first author established a database for the prospective collection of information from individuals being assessed for IIH. The database incorporates clinical, imaging, physiological, and biological data, and information about treatment/outcome. This study retrieved information from the database, asking the following research questions: In IIH subjects responding to shunt surgery, what is the occurrence of signs of CSF disturbance, sinus vein stenosis, intracranial hypertension, and microscopic evidence of structural abnormalities at the glia-neuro-vascular interface? Secondarily, do semi-quantitative measures of abnormal ultrastructure at the glia-neurovascular differ between subjects with definite IIH and non-IIH (reference) subjects? The study included 13 patients with IIH who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria and who improved following shunt surgery, i.e., patients with definite IIH. Comparisons were done regarding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, pulsatile and static ICP scores, and immune-histochemistry microscopy. Among these 13 IIH subjects, 6/13 (46%) of patients presented with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs of CSF disturbance (empty sella and/or distended perioptic subarachnoid spaces), 0/13 (0%) of patients with IIH had MRI signs of sinus vein stenosis, 13/13 (100%) of patients with IIH presented with abnormal preoperative pulsatile ICP [overnight mean ICP wave amplitude (MWA) above thresholds], 3/13 (23%) patients showed abnormal static ICP (overnight mean ICP above threshold), and 12/13 (92%) of patients with IIH showed abnormal structural changes at the glia-neuro-vascular interface. Comparisons of semi-quantitative structural variables between IIH and aged- and gender-matched reference (REF) subjects showed IIH abnormalities in glial cells, neurons, and capillaries. The present data suggest a key role of disease processes affecting the glia-neuro-vascular interface.

TI PULMONARY VASCULAR-RESPONSE TO INCREASE IN INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE - ROLE
   OF SYMPATHETIC MECHANISMS
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB The pulmonary vascular response to intracranial hypertension was studied in anesthetized controlled ventilated dogs in which intracranial pressure (ICP) was elevated to 20 Torr below the mean arterial pressure for a 20 min period, and regulated at this level. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased from control value of 2.7 .+-. 0.30 to 8.3 .+-. 0.51 Torr/l per min at the end of 20 min increase in ICP. The increase in PVR was associated with marked increase (P < 0.001) in pulmonary arterial pressure from 14.4 .+-. 1.3 to 35.4 .+-. 4.0 Torr, small increase in left atrial pressure from 5.4 .+-. 1.2 to 7.9 .+-. 1.9 Torr, and no significant change in pulmonary blood flow. The increase in PVR occurred independently of changes in the arterial pressure. The increase in PVR induced by elevated ICP was correlated with increases in lung water, physiological shunt (.ovrhdot.Qs/.ovrhdot.Qt), alveolar dead space (VD) and with hypoxemia. Pretreatment with propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) attenuated the increase in PVR during elevation in ICP; the smaller increase in PVR was associated with a marked increase in left atrial pressure and a smaller increase in pulmonary perfusion pressure than in the control group. The propranolol-treated dogs developed increases in lung water, .ovrhdot.Qs/.ovrhdot.Qt, VD and hypoxemia. In contrast, pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (1.5 mg/kg) inhibited the increases in pulmonary perfusion pressure and PVR induced by ICP elevation as well as the associated increases in lung water, .ovrhdot.Qs/.ovrhdot.Qt, VD and hypoxemia. A sustained elevation in ICP at a level below the mean arterial pressure in the intact dog evoked pulmonary vasoconstriction which was mediated by .alpha.-adrenergic mechanisms. The neurogenic pulmonary vasoconstriction resulted in the increases in lung water, .ovrhdot.Qs/.ovrhdot.Qt, VD and in the hypoxemia.

TI Severe cerebellar hemorrhage following transverse sinus stenting for
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB We report a severe adverse event occurring in the course of a cohort study (ISRCTN13784335) aimed at measuring the efficacy and safety of venous stenting in the treatment of patients with medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The patient was a 41-year-old woman who was not overweight, who presented with severe headache, grade 1 bilateral papilledema and transient tinnitus, refractory to medical treatment. Right transverse sinus stenting was successfully performed. Following surgery, the patient's state of consciousness decreased acutely with rapid and progressive loss of brainstem reflex. CT scan revealed acute cerebellar and intraventricular hemorrhage with obstructive hydrocephalus. Angioscan revealed normal venous sinus patency and cerebral MRI showed acute mesencephalic ischemia. Mechanical impairment of cerebellar venous drainage by the stent or venous perforation with the large guidewire used in this technique are two logical ways to explain the cerebellar hemorrhage seen in our patient. The risk of such a complication could probably be reduced using alternative tools and technique. However, given the low level of evidence around the safety of transverse sinus stenting in IIH, its formal assessment in clinical trials is required.

TI Bradycardia in neurosurgery
SO CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
AB Cushing reflex' is characterized by the occurrence of hypertension, bradycardia and apnoea secondary to raised increased intracranial pressure (ICP), leading to pressure on and or stretch, or both, of the brainstem. With the wide availability of monitoring facilities and advancements in investigation techniques, observation of increased intracranial pressure resulting in haemodynamic instability and bradycardia has been increasingly recognized in relation to many neurosurgical conditions and procedures. The causes of bradycardia include space occupying lesion involving or compressing the brain parenchyma (subdural haematoma, tumours, hydrocephalus), neurosurgical procedures (neuroendoscopy, placement of extradural drains), epileptic and non-epileptic seizures, trigemino-cardiac reflex, cerebellar lesions, spinal lesions (neurogenic shock, autonomic dysreflexia) and many other rare causes (Ventricular catheter obstruction in cases of hydrocephalus, colloid cysts related acute neurogenic cardiac dysfunction, Ondine's curse syndrome, etc.). This highlights that bradycardia can be a warning sign in many neurosurgical conditions and Cushing's reflex is a protective and effective action of the brain for preserving an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure despite an increased intracranial pressure. Management of these patients include identification and treatment of the underlying cause of bradycardia, anti-cholinergics and if necessary cardiac pacing, nevertheless, other causes of haemodynamic changes (i.e. anesthetic drugs, tumor manipulation) should also be considered and managed accordingly. We believe that this knowledge and understanding will help to identify the patients' at risk and will also help in the management of neurosurgical patients with bradycardia. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Paragangliomas that arise from the jugular bulb are known to present as masses in the neck or with hearing loss, pulsatile tinnitus, and lower cranial nerve palsies. Much less recognized is their tendency to cause increased intracranial pressure and papilledema by obstructing jugular venous outflow. Only 7 such cases have been reported and with minimal ophthalmic documentation. We describe 3 more cases to provide additional documentation and to emphasize that paragangliomas are a potential cause of the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, and that papilledema may be overlooked when a jugular paraganglioma is diagnosed or after it has been treated. Such lapses have led to disabling vision loss from damage to the optic nerves in long-standing papilledema.

TI Superior sagittal sinus-to-internal jugular vein bypass shunt with
   covered stent construct for intractable intracranial hypertension
   resulting from iatrogenic supratorcular sinus occlusion: technical note
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Background Acute occlusion of the posterior sagittal sinus may lead to dramatic increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), refractory to standard treatment. Hybrid vascular bypass of cranial venous outflow into the internal jugular vein (IJV) has seldom been described for this in recent neurosurgical literature. Objective To describe creation of a novel vascular bypass shunt from the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) to internal jugular vein (IJV) utilizing a covered stent-Dacron graft construct for control of refractory ICP. Methods We illustrate a patient with refractory ICP increases after acute sinus ligation that was performed to halt torrential bleeding from intraoperative injury. A temporary shunt was created that successfully controlled ICP. From the promising results of the temporary shunt, we utilized a prosthetic hybrid bypass graft to function as a shunt from the sagittal sinus to IJV. Yet the associated anticoagulation led to complications and a poor outcome. Results Rapid and sustained ICP reduction can be expected after sagittal sinus-to-jugular bypass shunt placement in acute sinus occlusion. Details of the surgical technique are described. Heparin anticoagulation, while imperative, is also associated with worrisome complications. Conclusion Acute occlusion of posterior third of sagittal sinus carries a very malignant clinical course. Intractable intracranial hypertension from acute sinus occlusion may be effectively treated with a SSS-IJV bypass shunt. A covered stent construct provides an effective vascular bypass conduit. However, the anticoagulation risk can lead to fatal outcomes. The neurosurgeon must always strive for primary repair of an injured sinus.

TI Intrathoracic pressure regulation improves 24-hour survival in a porcine
   model of hypovolemic shock
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB BACKGROUND: The intrathoracic pressure regulator (ITPR) plus positive pressure ventilation (PPV) has been shown to improve coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures during hypovolemia by improving mean arterial blood pressure and by decreasing right atrial and intracranial pressures. We hypothesized that application of intermittent negative intrathoracic pressure in a pig model of severe hypovolemic hypotension would increase 24-h neurological intact survival rates.
   METHODS: Eighteen isoflurane-anesthetized pigs were bled 55% of their estimated blood volume and were then prospectively randomized to either ITPR treatment with -8 mm. Hg enclotracheal pressure plus PPV or only PPV alone for 90 min. All survivors were reinfused with their own blood. Arterial blood gases, end-tidal CO2, and aortic pressures were monitored for the 90 min and neurological evaluation was performed at 12 and 24 h after reinfusion.
   RESULTS: ITPR plus PPV treatment for 90 min prevented the progression of metabolic acidosis and significantly improved mean arterial blood pressure (mean over 90 min, 55 +/- 3 vs 35 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, P < 0.001) when compared with controls. Twenty-four hour survival significantly improved with use of the ITPR when compared with untreated controls: 9/9 (100%) vs 1/9 (11%), P < 0.01.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of the ITPR plus PPV for 90 min significantly increased arterial blood pressure and 24 h neurologically intact survival rates compared with controls treated with PPV alone.

TI Continuous negative abdominal pressure device to treat pseudotumor
   cerebri
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY
AB OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of an externally applied negative abdominal pressure device designed to lower the effects of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on headaches and pulsatile tinnitus in severely obese women with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC).
   DESIGN: Short-term clinical intervention trial in the Clinical Research Center. Days 1 and 3 were 'control' days; on days 2 and 4-6 patients were in the device from 8:00 am to noon and from 1:00 to 5:00 pm, and on nights 7-11 they were in the device from 10:00 pm to 8:00 am. The last four patients were treated in a device with a counter-traction mechanism.
   SUBJECTS: Seven centrally obese women with PTC.
   MEASUREMENTS: Headache and pulsatile tinnitus severity were graded by the patient using visual analog scale (1-10) and averaged for the time that the device was in use or not in use. IAP was estimated from urinary bladder pressure (UBP) before and during device use. The internal jugular vein (IJV) elliptical cross-sectional area was measured with B-mode ultrasonography; the timed average velocity was measured by Doppler.
   RESULTS: There was a decrease in both headache (6.8 +/- 0.8 to 4.2 +/- 0.8, P < 0.05) and pulsatile tinnitus (4.2 <plus/minus> 0.5 to 1.8 +/- 0.5, P < 0.02) within 5 min, and in headache (to 2.2 <plus/minus> 0.8, P < 0.01) and tinnitus (to 1.7 <plus/minus> 0.5, P < 0.01) within 1 h of device activation. UBP decreased (P < 0.001) from 19.1 +/- 3 to 12.5 +/- 2.8 cmH(2)O. Headache remained improved throughout time that the device was used. During the second week, five of seven patients slept in the device without difficulty and four awoke without headache. There was a progressive decrease (P < 0.01) in headache during the day after sleeping in the device at night as compared with days 1 and 3 when it was not used (6.5 <plus/minus> 0.5, day 1; 4.1 +/- 0.7, day 3; 3.1 +/- 0.8, day 8; 2.3 +/-0.8, day 10). Headaches returned late in the afternoon in two patients; the device was reactivated and headache again improved. Five patients underwent IJV sonography; the IJV area decreased (129 +/- 53 to 100 +/- 44 mm(2), P = 0.06) without a change in IJV flow (1004 +/- 802 to 1000 +/- 589 ml/min) with the device. When activated, the device was pulled into the patient, creating discomfort that was alleviated with the counter-traction mechanism in the last four patients. One patient developed a 5 cm area of blisters that resolved when the device was worn over a hospital gown.
   CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing IAP relieved headaches and pulsatile tinnitus in PTC. When patients slept in the device, they awoke without headache or tinnitus, which remained markedly improved throughout most of the following day. This study supports the hypothesis that PTC in obese women is secondary to an increased IAP.

TI Management of critically ill children with traumatic brain injury
SO PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA
AB The management of critically ill children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) requires a precise assessment of the brain lesions but also of potentially associated extra-cranial injuries. Children with severe TBI should be treated in a pediatric trauma center, if possible. Initial assessment relies mainly upon clinical examination, trans-cranial Doppler ultrasonography and body CT scan. Neurosurgical operations are rarely necessary in these patients, except in the case of a compressive subdural or epidural hematoma. On the other hand, one of the major goals of resuscitation in these children is aimed at protecting against secondary brain insults (SBI). SBI are mainly because of systemic hypotension, hypoxia, hypercarbia, anemia and hyperglycemia. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = mean arterial blood pressure - intracranial pressure: ICP) should be monitored and optimized as soon as possible, taking into account age-related differences in optimal CPP goals. Different general maneuvers must be applied in these patients early during their treatment (control of fever, avoidance of jugular venous outflow obstruction, maintenance of adequate arterial oxygenation, normocarbia, sedation-analgesia and normovolemia). In the case of increased ICP and/or decreased CPP, first-tier ICP-specific treatments may be implemented, including cerebrospinal fluid drainage, if possible, osmotic therapy and moderate hyperventilation. In the case of refractory intracranial hypertension, second-tier therapy (profound hyperventilation with P(a)CO(2) < 35 mmHg, high-dose barbiturates, moderate hypothermia, decompressive craniectomy) may be introduced, after a new cerebral CT scan.

TI Superior vena cava syndrome
SO VASA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF VASCULAR MEDICINE
AB The superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is caused by compression, invasion, and/or thrombosis of the superior vena cava and/or the brachiocephalic veins. Benign SVCS is separated from malignant SVCS. SVCS comprises a broad clinical spectrum reaching from asymptomatic cases to rare life-threatening emergencies with upper airway obstruction and increased intracranial pressure. Symptoms are correlated to the acuity and extent of the venous obstruction and inversely correlated to the development of the venous collateral circuits. Imaging is necessary to determine the exact underlying cause and to guide further interventions. Interventional therapy has widely changed the therapeutic approach in symptomatic patients. This article provides an overview over this complex syndrome and focuses on interventional therapeutic methods and results.

TI Mechanical Ventilation during Acute Brain-Injury in Children
SO PAEDIATRIC RESPIRATORY REVIEWS
AB Mechanical ventilation in the brain-injured pediatric patient requires many considerations, including the type and severity of lung and brain injury and how progression of such injury will develop. This review focuses on neurological breathing patterns at presentation, the effect of brain injury on the lung, developmental aspects of blood gas tensions on cerebral blood flow, and strategies used during mechanical ventilation in infants and children receiving neurological intensive care. Taking these basic principles, our clinical approach is informed by balancing the blood gas tension targets that follow from the ventilation support we choose and the intracranial consequences of these choices on vascular and hydrodynamic physiology. As such, we are left with two key decisions: a low tidal volume strategy for the lung versus the consequence of hypercapnia on the brain; and the use of positive end expiratory pressure to optimize oxygenation versus the consequence of impaired cerebral venous return from the brain and resultant intracranial hypertension.

TI Multiple Intracranial Hemorrhages After Cervical Spinal Surgery -Case
   Report-
SO NEUROLOGIA MEDICO-CHIRURGICA
AB A 69-year-old woman presented with a rare case of multiple supra- and infratentorial intracranial hemorrhages after cervical laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy without intraoperative liquorrhea. A wound drainage tube under negative pressure was placed with subsequent 380 ml of drainage in the first 12 hours. She had no complaint of headache and nausea at that time. Computed tomography of the brain obtained at 15 hours after surgery demonstrated cerebellar hemorrhage, acute subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, supratentorial intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and pneumocephalus. She was treated medically without consequent neurological deficits other than right hemianopsia. Overdrainage of cerebrospinal fluid through an occult dural tear might cause severely low intracranial pressure with subsequent multiple intracranial hemorrhages. Wound drainage should be controlled thoroughly even in patients without intraoperative liquorrhea.

TI Mechanistic-mathematical modeling of intracranial pressure (ICP)
   profiles over a single heart cycle. The fundament of the ICP curve form
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY
AB The intracranial pressure (ICP) curve with its different peaks has been comprehensively studied, but the exact physiological mechanisms behind its morphology has not been revealed. If the pathophysiology behind deviations from the normal ICP curve form could be identified, it could be vital information to diagnose and treat each single patient. A mathematical model of the hydrodynamics in the intracranial cavity over single heart cycles was developed. A Windkessel model approach was generalized but the unsteady Bernoulli equation was utilized for blood flow and CSF flow. This is a modification of earlier models using the extended and simplified classical Windkessel analogies to a model that is based on mechanisms rooted in the laws of physics. The improved model was calibrated with patient data for cerebral arterial inflow, venous outflow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and ICP over one heart cycle from 10 neuro-intensive care unit patients. A priori model parameter values were obtained by considering patient data and values taken from earlier studies. These values were used as an initial guess for an iterated constrained-ODE (ordinary differential equation) optimization problem with cerebral arterial inflow data as input into the system of ODEs. The optimization routine found patient-specific model parameter values that produced model ICP curves that showed excellent agreement with clinical measurements while model venous and CSF flow were within a physiologically acceptable range. The improved model and the automated optimization routine gave better model calibration results compared to previous studies. Moreover, patient-specific values of physiologically important parameters like intracranial compliance, arterial and venous elastance, and venous outflow resistance were determined. The model was used to simulate intracranial hydrodynamics and to explain the underlying mechanisms of the ICP curve morphology. Sensitivity analysis showed that the order of the three main peaks of the ICP curve was affected by a decrease in arterial elastance, a large increase in resistance to arteriovenous flow, an increase in venous elastance, or a decrease in resistance to CSF flow in the foramen magnum; and the frequency of oscillations were notably affected by intracranial elastance. In particular, certain pathological peak patterns were caused by these changes in physiological parameters. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other mechanism-based models associating the pathological peak patterns to variation of the physiological parameters.

TI Normobaric Oxygen May Ameliorate Cerebral Venous Outflow
   Disturbance-Related Neurological Symptoms
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Cerebral venous outflow disturbance (CVOD) has begun to garner the attention of researches owing to a series of clinical symptoms that impose a significant impact on people's quality of life. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether normobaric oxygen (NBO) can ameliorate CVOD-induced neurological symptoms. This was one part of the prospective trial registered in (NCT03373292). A total of 37 CVOD patients were divided into the NBO group (5-8 L/min of oxygen inhalation, 1 h per time, 3 times daily, n = 19) and the control group (without oxygen inhalation, n = 18) randomly. The assessments were performed at admission, 1-week hospitalization, and 6-month follow-up. Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) data were recorded prior to and post 1 h of NBO in some patients. R software was used for data analysis. No NBO-related adverse events were observed during the whole NBO intervention process. The 1-week Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale showed that the symptom improvement occurred in nine patients in the NBO group (47.4%) while none in the control group (p = 0.001). NBO could improve headache evaluated with visual analog scale (pre-NBO vs. post-NBO: 4.70 +/- 2.16 vs. 2.90 +/- 2.03, p = 0.024) and Headache Impact Test-6 (53.40 +/- 12.15 vs. 50.30 +/- 13.04, p = 0.041). As for 6-month PGIC follow-up, eight out of 14 cases (57.1%) in the NBO group reported improvement, while only one out of 12 patients in the control group replied mild improvement (p = 0.014). The qEEG revealed that NBO reduced the ratio of theta to alpha power (0.65 +/- 0.38 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.35, p = 0.030) over the fronto-central electrodes. To sum up, NBO may be a safe and effective approach to attenuate CVOD-related symptoms (especially for headache) by brain functional improvement resulting from increasing oxygen supply to the brain tissues.

TI The future is now: neuroprotection during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB Purpose of review
   Survival with favorable neurological function after cardiac arrest remains low. The purpose of this review is to identify recent advances that focus on neuroprotection during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
   Recent findings
   Multiple strategies have been shown to enhance neuroprotection during CPR. Brain perfusion during CPR is increased with therapies such as active compression decompression CPR and intrathoracic pressure regulation that improve cardiac preload and decrease intracranial pressure. Head Up CPR has been shown to decrease intracranial pressure thereby increasing cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow. Sodium nitroprusside enhanced CPR increases cerebral perfusion, facilitates heat exchange, and improves neurologic survival in swine after cardiac arrest. Postconditioning has been administered during CPR in laboratory settings. Poloxamer 188, a membrane stabilizer, and ischemic postconditioning have been shown to improve cardiac and neural function after cardiac arrest in animal models. Postconditioning with inhaled gases protects the myocardium, with more evidence mounting for the potential for neural protection.
   Summary
   Multiple promising neuroprotective therapies are being developed in animal models of cardiac arrest, and are in early stages of human trials. These therapies have the potential to be bundled together to improve rates of favorable neurological survival after cardiac arrest.

TI COMPUTER MODELING OF SIPHONING FOR CSF SHUNT DESIGN EVALUATION
SO PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY
AB A computer model of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment and various shunt designs was developed to simulate CSF dynamics, particularly in the upright position in which siphoning is known to occur. This novel mathematical model of the CSF compartment incorporates negative pressure and volume components that permit simulation of siphoning. The model was tested with data from a previously reported animal experiment. The correspondence between the model simulation and the reported intracranial pressure and CSF shunt flow rate was very good. A simulation of a shunted hydrocephalic patient in the recumbent and upright position was then carried out to examine the effects of a standard shunt valve, an externally adjustable valve, a variable resistance valve, and an antisiphon device. The resulting pressure profiles, which conformed to previously reported data, indicate that this model would be useful for the evaluation of current and future shunt designs.

TI Unilateral Transverse Sinus Stenting of Patients with Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pathophysiology of IIH remains unknown. TS stenoses have been observed in a high proportion of these patients. Stent placement to remove this potential obstruction to venous outflow has been proposed as a treatment option for patients with IIH refractory to medical treatment.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with refractory IIH evaluated for venous sinus stent placement at a tertiary care center was retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Thirteen female patients with IIH were evaluated for sinovenous stent placement. Moderate sinus stenoses with normal intrasinus pressures were found in 3 patients and therefore stent placement was not performed. Ten patients had elevated intrasinus pressures (pressure gradient across stenosis, 11-50 mm Hg), which decreased following unilateral TS stent placement. Headaches improved or resolved in all stented patients. Papilledema resolved completely or almost completely in 8 patients and significantly improved in 2 patients. One patient developed optic atrophy. There were no major periprocedural complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this small case series, restoring the patency of stenotic venous sinuses with a stent in patients with refractory IIH resulted in symptomatic improvement in all treated patients. The safety and efficacy of this procedure should be evaluated in a randomized controlled study to determine its role within the armamentarium of therapeutic options for patients with IIH.

TI Chronic overdrainage syndrome: pathophysiological insights based on ICP
   analysis: a case-based review
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Chronic overdrainage affects shunted patients producing a variety of symptoms that may be misdiagnosed. The best known symptoms are so-called shunt-related headaches. There is mounting evidence that changes in cerebrospinal venous system dynamics are a key factor to the pathophysiology of chronic overdrainage syndrome.
   We report the case of a 29-year-old woman with a shunt since the postnatal period suffering from chronic but the most severe intermittent headache attacks, despite an open shunt and with unchanged ventricular width during attacks. Intracranial pressure (ICP) recordings were performed during headache attacks and thereafter.
   Massively increased ICPs, a continuous B wave "storm," and severely compromised intracranial compliance despite an open shunt were found, a scenario that was always self-limiting with the resolution of symptoms after several hours. When mobilized to the upright position, her ICPs dropped to - 17 mm Hg, proving shunt overdrainage.
   Symptomatology can only be explained by sudden venous entrapment following chronic venous distention as a result of chronic overdrainage. Subsequent therapeutic management with an overdrainage preventing shunt and satisfying clinical outcome with complete ceasing of headache attacks adds insight into the pathophysiology of chronic overdrainage syndrome.

TI Retrograde 3D rotational venography (3DRV) for venous sinus stent
   placement in idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Dural venous sinus stenting has emerged as an effective and durable treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Improved visualization of the venous sinuses can improve stent placement.
   Methods We present two cases of IIH treated with venous sinus stenting in which retrograde three-dimensional rotational venography (3DRV) provided superior anatomical details of the venous sinuses for optimal sizing and positioning of stent.
   Results Comparison of pre-stent 3DRV with post-stent contrast-enhanced flat panel detector CT allowed confirmation of stent placement and the result of stenosis dilation.
   Conclusion This 3DRV technique provides precise visualization of venous sinus stenosis prior to stenting without the need for arterial cerebral angiography during the treatment course.

TI Dural arteriovenous shunts in children
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Dural arteriovenous shunts (dAVF) in children can be classified as dural sinus malformations, infantile dural arteriovenous shunts, and adult-type dural arteriovenous shunts. All subtypes can result in neurologic morbidity as a result of venous or intracranial hypertension and its sequelae. Prognostication and appropriate management is incumbent depends upon understanding both the subtype of dural arteriovenous shunt and its relevant anatomy. When treatment is indicated, endovascular embolization is the mainstay. Surgical treatment may be used adjunctively, though its primary indication is for adult-type dAVF with direct leptomeningeal venous drainage, which cannot be easily accessed by endovascular means. Although radiosurgery has been used successfully in adults with dAVF, its utility for pediatric patients remains largely unexplored.

TI Association of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea with
   transverse venous sinus stenosis: a retrospective matched case-control
   study
SO INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY
AB Background A significant proportion of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (sCSF) leaks are associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The aim of this study was to assess the association between sCSF rhinorrhea and transverse venous sinus stenosis (VSS), a feature commonly observed in IIH with a proposed role in its pathophysiology. Methods In this single-center, retrospective, matched case-control study, venous and pituitary imaging data of consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic surgery for sCSF rhinorrhea over the last 10 years were retrospectively reviewed. Measurement of the height of the pituitary gland was used to assess empty sella and VSS was quantified as the ratio between the minimal area of the transverse sinus and the cross-sectional area of the sigmoid sinus. VSS was considered significant when it was >= 50% and bilateral. Cases were compared with 1:1 age- and sex-adjusted controls explored for causes other than IIH, intracranial mass effect, or venous thrombosis. Results Twenty-nine patients were included (median age 56 years, females 69%, body mass index [BMI] 33.8 kg/m(2)). Cases had a significantly lower height of the pituitary gland than controls (2.5 mm vs 6.6 mm,p< 0.001). Bilateral VSS was found in 23 of 29 cases (79%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 65% to 94%) vs 3 of 29 controls (10%; 95% CI, 0% to 21%), withp< 0.001. Conclusion In this retrospective study, sCSF leaks were strongly associated with VSS. This novel finding provides a rationale for further investigation of the role of VSS in the onset of sCSF leaks and of the potential interest in venous stenting after the surgical repair of leaks.

TI Predicting the need for retreatment in venous sinus stenting for
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background
   Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disease of raised intra-cranial pressure of unknown etiology. Lateral cerebral venous sinus stenosis (VSS) has been increasingly reported in these patients, and stenting has emerged as an alternative treatment for medically refractory symptoms. Treatment efficacy on meta-analysis appears promising, but identifying which patients are likely to benefit most, and which are likely to require repeat procedures, is currently unclear.
   Methods
   We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of 79 patients treated with venous sinus stenting at a single academic center with minimum follow-up of 18 months. We extracted baseline clinical data, as well as manometry at lumbar puncture and during angiography, and used logistic regression to identify parameters that could predict stent failure.
   Results
   Retreatment rate after successful VSS was 13.9%. Lumbar puncture opening pressure (OP) was shown to significantly predict treatment failure (ss=0.06; OR=1.064 (1.003-1.135); P=0.039). This effect remained significant when age, sex and body mass index were added to the model (ss=0.06; OR=1.066 (1.002-1.140); P=0.043). OP was correlated with venous sinus manometry readings in the superior sagittal and transverse sinus pre-stent placement, as well trans-stenotic gradient (P<0.001).
   Conclusions
   Higher lumbar puncture OP was associated with an increased risk of stent failure in transverse sinus stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, although the performance of this model as a linear discriminator was poor. Further studies are required to better assess which patients are at greatest risk of treatment failure.

TI Cardiac output changes after osmotic therapy in neurosurgical and
   neurocritical care patients: a systematic review of the clinical
   literature
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB AimOsmotherapy constitutes a first-line intervention for intracranial hypertension management. However, hyperosmolar solutes exert various systematic effects, among which their impact on systemic haemodynamics is poorly clarified. This review aims to appraise the clinical evidence of the effect of mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS) on cardiac performance in neurosurgical and neurocritical care patients.
   MethodA database search was conducted to identify randomized clinical trials and observational studies reporting HTS or mannitol use in acute brain injury setting. The primary end-points were alterations of cardiac output (CO) and other haemodynamic variables, while the impact of osmotic agents on intracranial pressure, brain relaxation, plasma osmolality, electrolyte levels and urinary output constituted secondary outcomes.
   ResultsEight studies, enrolling 182 patients in total, were included. HTS exerted a more profound cardiac output augmentation than mannitol, but no distinct difference between groups occurred. Central venous pressure, stroke volume and stroke volume variation were favourably affected by both osmotic agents, whilst the reported changes in blood pressure were inconclusive. HTS infusion yielded a larger intracranial pressure reduction than mannitol but had an equivalent effect on brain relaxation. Mannitol presented a more potent diuretic effect than HTS. Effect on serum osmolality was alike in both osmotic agents, but contrary to HTS-promoted hypernatraemia, mannitol use induced transient hyponatraemia.
   ConclusionsMannitol or HTS administration seems to induce an enhancement of cardiac performance; being more prominent after HTS infusion. This effect combined with mannitol-induced enhancement of diuresis and HTS-promoted increase of plasma sodium concentration could partially explain the effects of osmotherapy on cerebral haemodynamics.

TI Intra-abdominal hypertension in the critically ill: it is time to pay

SO CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
CT 17th Annual Congress of the European-Society-of-Intensive-Care-Medicine
CY OCT 10-13, 2004
CL Berlin, GERMANY
SP European Soc Intens Care Med
AB Purpose of the review There has been an exponentially increasing in intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). Comparison of the published data however is difficult due to the lack of consensus definitions. This review will focus on the available literature from the last 2 years. A Medline and PubMed search was performed using 'intra-abdominal pressure' (IAP), 'intra-abdominal hypertension' (IAH), and 'abdominal compartment syndrome' (ACS) as search items. The aim was to find an answer to the question 'Isn't it time to pay attention to intra-abdominal pressure in the critically ill?'
   Recent findings Although the number of studies published on this topic is steadily increasing and confirms the pathophysiologic implications of IAH on end-organ function within and outside the abdominal cavity it remains difficult to compare the literature data because the measurement methods and definitions used are not uniform. Provocative data have been published regarding the interactions between the abdominal and thoracic compartments especially in patients with capillary leak and fluid overload; most of this data raises even more questions than it gives answers and may therefore strengthen the nonbelievers who consider IAP, IAH and ACS as epiphenomena in critically ill patients. Unless the international scientific community does not come forward with clear-cut definitions we will keep comparing 'apples with oranges'.
   Summary It is time to pay attention to intra-abdominal pressure in the critically ill. It is also time for standardized IAP measurement methods, good consensus definitions and randomized interventional studies.

   venous occlusive disease in a chronic hemodialysis patient: A case
   report
SO BRAIN CIRCULATION
AB Central venous occlusive disease secondary to chronic hemodialysis catheterization rarely progresses to encephalopathy, cerebral infarction, and/or hemorrhage. A 59-year-old male with 15 years of haemodialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease presented with acutely altered mental status, extensor rigidity with left hemiparesis and equal, but small and nonreactive pupils. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated infarction and cerebral edema. Cranial angiogram through right brachial artery injection revealed right subclavian vein opacification via a patent AV-fistula and retrograde flow to the right internal jugular vein and superior sagittal sinus secondary to occlusion of the brachiocephalic vein. All cerebral and right upper extremity venous drainage occurred via the contralateral venous outflow tract. Internal carotid artery injections revealed significant venous congestion. Despite successful angioplasty with stenting and resolution of venous flow reversal, the patient failed to recover neurologically. The devastating nature of the presented case emphasizes the need for frequent neurologic evaluation of such patients to avoid catastrophic cerebrovascular injury.

TI Spontaneous intracranial hypo and hypertensions:An imaging review
SO NEUROLOGY INDIA
AB Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure changes can manifest as either intracranial hypertension or hypotension. The idiopathic forms are largely under or misdiagnosed. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension occurs due to reduced CSF pressure usually as a result of a spontaneous dural tear. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a syndrome of elevated intracranial tension without hydrocephalus or mass lesions and with normal CSF composition. Neuroimaging plays an important role in excluding secondary causes of raised intracranial tension. As the clinical presentation is varied, imaging may also help the clinician in arriving at the diagnosis of IIH with the help of a few specific signs. In this review, we attempt to compile the salient magnetic resonance imaging findings in these two conditions. Careful observation of these findings may help in early accurate diagnosis and to provide appropriate early treatment.

TI Cerebral CO<sub>2</sub> vasoreactivity evaluation with and without
   changes in intrathoracic pressure in comatose patients
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB It is well established that cerebral blood flow (CBF) is sensitive to variations in arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) and can be influenced by changes in jugular venous return due to elevated intrathoracic pressure. Therefore, we compared cerebral CO2 vasoreactivity when PaCO2 was altered either by changing inspired PCO2 or tidal volume. In addition. we sought to determine if noninvasive transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can be used instead of invasive CBF measurement to determine cerebral CO2 vasoreactivity. In 36 mechanically ventilated patients in coma due to acute brain lesion, we evaluated CBF by continuous jugular thermodilution, middle cerebral artery flow velocity (Vm) by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, intracranial pressure (ICP; in only 23 of them) by intraventricular catheter, systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic variables, and arterial and jugular bulb blood gases. Measurements were taken at four levels of PaCO2 (25, 30, 35, and 40 mmHg) by modifying in a random order either tidal volume or inspired. PCO2. Cerebral, pulmonary, and systemic hemodynamic changes were similar in magnitude during both methods of altering PaCO2. From the highest to the lowest PaCO2, CBF decreased from 61 +/- 7 to 36 +/- 4 ml/min/100 g (p < 0.001, mean +/- SE), Vm from 89 +/- 7 to 65 +/- 5 cm/s (p < 0.001), and ICP from 29 +/- 2 to 12 +/- 2 mmHg (p < 0.001), but cerebral perfusion pressure remained constant, ranging from 65 +/- 3 to 67 +/- 4 mmHg (p = NS). Arteriojugular oxygen content difference increased from 3.2 +/- 0.2 to 5.7 +/- 0.4 ml/dl (p < 0.001). Eleven of the 20 patients with a preserved CBF response to CO2 survived to 6 months, whereas only two of the 16 patients with an altered response were alive at 6 months (p < 0.05). When compared with CBF by jugular thermodilution, the rates of sensitivity and specificity of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to detect impaired cerebral CO2 vasoreactivity were 69% and 65%, respectively. In conclusion, the reduction of PaCO2 from 40 to 25 mmHg by modifying either tidal volume or inspired PCO2 resulted in similar effects on cerebral, pulmonary, and systemic circulations. Cerebral CO2 vasoreactivity is of prognostic value in brain-injured patients when determined using CBF but may be misleading when evaluated using velocities measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography.

TI Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and
   future prospects
SO JOURNAL OF PAIN RESEARCH
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is an uncommon disorder characterized by increased intracranial pressure without radiological or laboratory evidence of intracranial pathology except empty sella turcica, optic nerve sheath with filled out cerebrospinal fluid spaces, and smooth-walled nonflow-related venous sinus stenosis or collapse. This condition typically affects obese women. The incidence of IIH is increasing with the rising prevalence of obesity. Persistent headache is the most common symptom. Visual impairment is a serious complication that may not be recognized by the patients. This paper reviews clinical manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and current treatments of IIH in adults. Various imaging modalities have been studied on their validity for detection of IIH and papilledema. This review also includes new studies on medical, surgical, and interventional management of this condition. Acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials about their efficacy in treatment of IIH. In patients who have severe visual impairment or progressive visual deterioration despite medical management, surgical or interventional treatment may be considered. The efficacy and complications of cerebrospinal fluid diversion, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and endovascular venous stenting reported in the last 3 decades have been summarized in this review. Finally, the prospective aspects of biomarkers and treatments are proposed for future research.

TI Optimal temperature for the management of severe traumatic brain injury:
   Effect of hypothermia on intracranial pressure, systemic and
   intracranial hemodynamics, and metabolism
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of hypothermia on intracranial pressure, systemic and intracranial hemodynamics, and metabolism in patients with severe traumatic brain injury to clarify the optimal temperature for hypothermia, with a view toward establishing the proper management techniques for such patients.
   METHODS: The study was performed in 31 patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score as high as 5). All patients were sedated, paralyzed, ventilated, and cooled to 33degreesC. Brain temperature, core temperature, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, jugular venous oxygen saturation, mixed venous oxygen saturation, cardiac output, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and testing energy expenditure were monitored continuously.
   RESULTS: Intracranial pressure decreased significantly at brain temperatures below 37degreesC and decreased more sharply at temperatures 35 to 36degreesC, but no differences were observed at temperatures below 35degreesC. Cerebral perfusion pressure peaked at 35.0 to 35.9degreesC and decreased with further decreases in temperature. jugular venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen saturation remained in the normal range during hypothermia. Resting energy expenditure and cardiac output decreased progressively with hypothermia. Oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption decreased to abnormally low levels at rectal temperatures below 35degreesC, and the correlation between them became less significant at less than 35degreesC than that when temperatures were 35degreesC or higher. Brain temperature was consistently higher than rectal temperature by 0.5 +/- 0.3degreesC.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, after traumatic brain injury, decreasing body temperature to 35 to 35.5degreesC can reduce intracranial hypertension while maintaining sufficient cerebral perfusion pressure without cardiac dysfunction or oxygen debt. Thus, 35 to 35.5degreesC seems to be the optimal temperature at which to treat patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

TI Transverse Venous Sinus Stenosis in Patients With Nasal Cerebrospinal
   Fluid Leak and Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
AB ObjectiveSpontaneous nasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are frequently linked to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The objectives of our study were: (1) to determine the rate of transverse venous sinus stenosis (TVSS) in patients with spontaneous nasal CSF leak and in patients with IIH without CSF (controls), and (2) to study the correlation between spontaneous nasal CSF leak and brain imaging features. Study DesignA multicenter retrospective case-control study. SettingSix French tertiary hospitals. MethodsPatients with spontaneous nasal CSF leaks and patients with IIH without nasal CSF leaks (controls) were included. The transverse venous sinus patency was analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging to identify possible stenosis or hypoplasia. ResultsThirty-two patients with spontaneous nasal CSF leaks and 32 controls were included. TVSS was significantly more frequent in patients with spontaneous nasal CSF leaks than in controls (p = .029). Univariate analysis indicated that TVSS (odds ratio, OR: 4.2; 95% confidence interval, CI [1.352-14.915]; p = .017) and arachnoid granulations (OR: 3; 95% CI [1.065-8.994]; p = .042) were risk factors for spontaneous nasal CSF leak. In multivariate analysis, TVSS and arachnoid granulations were independent risk factors of nasal CSF leak (OR: 5.577, 95% CI [1.485-25.837], p = .016; and OR: 4.35, 95% CI [1.234-17.756], p = .029, respectively). ConclusionThis multicenter case-control study shows that TVSS is an independent risk factor for CSF leak in patients with IIH. Stenosis management by interventional radiology may be proposed postoperatively to increase the success of IIH surgical treatment or preoperatively to reduce the need for surgery.

   neuroinfections
SO ZHURNAL NEVROPATOLOGII I PSIKHIATRII IMENI S S KORSAKOVA
AB Transcranial dopplerography was performed in 125 children with late (1-3 years) neurologic sequelae of acute neuroinfections. Decreased blood flow velocity (BFV) in middle cerebral arteries (0,61 of the value in control group) was found in patients with movement disorders. Impairment of the intracranial venous outflow together with both acceleration and asymmetry of blood flow in basal veins was prevalent in children with intracranial hypertension and hydrocephaly syndrome. Hyperconstriction of cerebral vessels together with a low BFV (30% of the initial value) was observed during hyperventilation on the side of the lesion in patients with epileptic syndrome. In children with cerebrasthenic syndrome the effect of cavinton treatment depended on the type of changes in cerebral blood flow: positive effect was found in patients with asymmetric decrease of BFV in anterior cerebral arteries.

TI Sinus pericranii in achondroplasia: a case report and review of the
   literature
SO CLINICAL DYSMORPHOLOGY
AB In the field of dysmorphology, achondroplasia is a well-known disorder. Sinus pericranii (SP), however, is not. The latter condition is a rare vascular malformation characterized by abnormal connections between the intracranial and the extracranial venous drainage pathways. The etiology of SP remains unclear, and yet, these defects can be present at birth, develop spontaneously later, or evolve following head trauma. Here, we report on a 2-year-old male with achondroplasia, SP, and craniocervical junction stenosis. The latter two defects required surgical correction. SP is an underappreciated malformation that we propose may be induced by increased intracranial pressure. This case appears to be the first report of this condition in achondroplasia.

TI Risk factors for failed transverse sinus stenting in pseudotumor cerebri
   patients
SO CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
AB Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) when no underlying etiology is found, is a clinical syndrome characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) (>25 cmH(2)O), which may lead to headaches and visual symptoms. In patients with IIH who are found to have transverse sinus stenosis, placement of a venous stent across the stenosis has been shown to lower ICP and to resolve the symptoms in several case series, with generally favorable results. In this study, we examine common risk factors associated with failure of transvenous stenting for IIH. If venous sinus stenting fails, CSF diversion should be considered as the next line of treatment.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of eighteen patients diagnosed with IIH who underwent venous sinus stenting for transverse sinus stenosis with a mean pressure gradient (MPG) of at least 4 mmHg. Fifteen of these patients did not need further treatment. We compared their pre- and post-treatment, neurological and neuro-ophthalmological evaluations to the three patients who went on to have a shunt placement as a second line treatment.
   Results: Shunting after stent placement patients (n=3) had a mean age of 30 years and a mean body mass index of 36.6 kg/m(2), whereas the group that underwent stent placement alone (n = 15) had a mean age of 40.7 years and a mean body mass index of 33.3 kg/m(2). In the shunting after stent placement group, the mean opening pressure on the most recent lumbar puncture obtained prior to any intervention was 50 cm of H2O, whereas the group that underwent stent placement alone had an opening CSF pressure of 37 cm of H2O which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). There were no other significant differences in pre- or post-intervention factors between the two groups.
   Conclusion: In patients with IIH and documented evidence of venous sinus stenosis with a pressure gradient, venous sinus stenting should be the primary treatment of choice; however, some patients may be refractory to stenting and still require permanent CSF diversion, which can be complicated in these chronically anticoagulated patients. Patients with persistent papilledema post-stenting and highly elevated opening pressure pre-stenting should be followed closely as they are at greatest risk of requiring a shunt and failing stenting.

TI Development of a Quick Reference Table for Setting Programmable Pressure
   Valves in Patients With Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus
SO NEUROLOGIA MEDICO-CHIRURGICA
AB Quick and reliable setting of programmable pressure valves (PPVs) is important in the treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), especially for reducing overdrainage complications and related medical costs. A new quick reference table (QRT) was developed for improved PPV control and outcome. Shunt control can be based on the pressure environment in the sitting condition, given as hydrostatic pressure (HP) = intracranial pressure + PPV setting + intraabdominal pressure (IAP). Using this relationship, and estimating HP and IAP from the patient's height and body mass index, respectively, a QRT was designed, consisting of a matrix of the patient's height and weight. The QRT was used to make initial PPV settings in 25 patients with iNPH and the clinical outcomes were evaluated. Postoperative readjustments of the PPV were not necessary in 15 of the 25 patients. At 1 month after operation, the PPV setting was decreased once in 5 patients and increased once in 2 patients. Four of these 7 patients improved after a single readjustment. Three patients required further readjustments. At 3 months after operation, another 3 patients required a single readjustment and all improved after this readjustment. The readjustment rate was 40% and readjustment number was 0.68 times/patient. The mean PPV setting at 1 year after operation was 15.5 +/- 3.9 cmH(2)O. Use of the QRT in non-bedridden iNPH patients results in a low incidence of PPV readjustment.

TI Physiological Changes and Clinical Implications of Syndromic
   Craniosynostosis
SO JOURNAL OF KOREAN NEUROSURGICAL SOCIETY
AB Syndromic craniosynostosis has severe cranial stenosis and deformity, combined with hypoplastic maxillary bone and other developmental skeletal lesions. Among these various lesions, upper air way obstruction by hypoplastic maxillary bone could be the first life-threatening condition after birth. Aggressive cranial vault expansion for severely deformed cranial vaults due to multiple synostoses is necessary even in infancy, to normalize the intracranial pressure. Fronto-orbital advancement (FOA) is recommended for patients with hypoplastic anterior part of cranium induced by bicoronal and/or metopic synostoses, and posterior cranial vault expansion is recommended for those with flattening of the posterior part of the cranium by lambdoid synostosis. Although sufficient spontaneous reshaping of the cranium can be expected by expansive cranioplasty, keeping the cranial bone flap expanded sufficiently is often difficult when the initial expansion is performed during infancy. So far distraction osteogenesis (DO) is the only method to make it possible and to provide low rates of re-expansion of the cranial vault. DO is quite beneficial for both FOA and posterior cranial vault expansion, compared with the conventional methods. Associated hydrocephalus and chronic tonsillar herniation due to lambdoid synostosis can be surgically treatable. Abnormal venous drainages from the intracranial space and air way obstruction should be always considered at any surgical procedures. Neurosurgeons have to know well about the managements not only of the deformed cranial vault and the associated brain lesions but also of other multiple skeletal lesions associated with syndromic craniosynostosis, to improve treatment outcome.

TI INTRA-CRANICAL HYPERTENSION AND BRAIN EDEMA IN ALBINO RABBITS .3. EFFECT
   OF ACUTE SIMULTANEOUS DIURETIC AND BARBITURATE THERAPY
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Increased intracranial pressure [ICP] due to brain edema was produced in albino rabbits by combining a cryogenic lesion in the left hemisphere with the i.p. administration of 6-aminonicotinamide (cytotoxic agent). ICP, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), central venous pressure (CVP), EEG, brain water and electrolyte content, gross pathology and blood brain barrier integrity were assessed. Acute therapy to reduce ICP was performed by administering a bolus of mannitol (1 g/kg) and 30 min later, also in bolus, frusemide (5 mg/kg). Immediately following the administration of mannitol an infusion of pentobarbitone was done; this was continued for 1 h so that 10 mg/kg was administered. There was a 50% reduction of ICP at 1 h from initiation of treatment. The brains of the animals were extracted immediately upon cessation of therapy (pentobarbitone); they revealed a significant reduction of water content for the right, uninjured hemisphere only when compared to controls. A slight but not significant reduction of the brain Na and K was noted in both hemispheres. There was no change noted in the gross pathology and extent of blood brain barrier breakdown. In all animals epinephrine infusion had to be administered for between 20 and 30 min to maintain a SAP over 80 torr. There was evidently no advantage in the simultaneous administration of barbiturates and diuretics for the control of ICP due to brain edema.

TI MR imaging findings of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas:
   Relations with venous drainage patterns
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Venous drainage patterns are a major determinant of clinical outcome in intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVIT) patients. In this study, we sought to identify MR imaging finding differences between DAVF types classified on the basis of venous drainage patterns.
   METHODS: Twenty-seven patients diagnosed as having DAVFs by conventional angiography were included. Medical records (n = 27), and MR imaging (n = 27) and MR angiography (MRA; n = 11) findings were retrospectively reviewed. MR imaging findings included flow void cluster, engorged ophthalmic vein/proptosis, white matter hyperintensity, intracranial hemorrhage, dilated leptomeningeal or medullary vessels, venous pouch, and leptomeningeal or medullary vascular enhancements. MRA findings included identifiable fistula, venous flow-related enhancement, and prominent extracranial vessels. Patients' presentations and MR imaging findings were compared among angiographic type I, II, and III cases (according to Borden's classification), and MRA findings were compared between cases with and without retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage (RLVD).
   RESULTS: Patient presentations were aggressive in one (13%) of the type I cases, 5 (50%) of the type H cases, and 8 (10001) of the type III cases (P = .002). Aggressive presentations included hemorrhage, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, intracranial hypertension, and an altered mental status. MR images showed significantly higher frequencies of dilated leptomeningeal or medullary vessels in a higher type [0 in type I, 5 (42%) in type II, and 7 (100%) in type III], and of leptomeningeal or medullary vascular enhancements [0 in type I, 4 (33010) in type II, and 7 (100%) in type III]. By using MRA, fistulas were identified only in cases with RLVD (5 [83%]). Venous flow-related enhancement was present in 10 cases (91%). A sole false-negative case on MRA, as compared with conventional angiography, resulted from nonvisualization of the slow venous flow (8%). No false-positive fistula was found at the other intracranial sites in all cases. Overall, MRA assessment for DAVF was adequate for both fistula and venous flow-related enhancement in 10 cases (91%) and inadequate in a remaining case because of the fistular location out of field.
   CONCLUSION: MR imaging demonstration of leptomeningeal or medullary vascular dilation and enhancements may be associated with features that are considered predictors of a poor outcome and indicates a need for urgent therapy in intracranial dural AVF patients. MRA is a complementary tool for the identification of dural AVF with venous flow-related enhancement.

TI Lower body negative pressure reduces optic nerve sheath diameter during
   head-down tilt
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB The microgravity ocular syndrome (MOS) results in significant structural and functional ophthalmic changes during 6-mo spaceflight missions consistent with an increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure compared with the preflight upright position. A ground-based study was performed to assess two of the major hypothesized contributors to MOS, headward fluid shifting and increased ambient CO2, on intracranial and periorbital CSF. In addition, lower body negative pressure (LBNP) was assessed as a countermeasure to headward fluid shifting. Nine healthy male subjects participated in a crossover design study with five head-down tilt (HDT) conditions: -6, -12, and -18 degrees HDT, 12 degrees HDT with -20 mmHg LBNP, and -12 degrees HDT with a 1% CO2 environment, each for 5 h total. A three-dimensional volumetric scan of the cranium and transverse slices of the orbita were collected with MRI, and intracranial CSF volume and optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) were measured after 4.5 h HDT. ONSD increased during -6 degrees (P < 0.001), -12 degrees (P < 0.001), and -18 degrees HDT (P < 0.001) and intracranial CSF increased during -12 degrees HDT (P = 0.01) compared with supine baseline. Notably, LBNP was able to reduce the increases in ONSD and intracranial CSF during HDT. The addition of 1% CO2 during HDT, however, had no further effect on ONSD, but rather ONSD increased from baseline in a similar magnitude to -12 degrees HDT with ambient air (P = 0.001). These findings demonstrate the ability of LBNP, a technique that targets fluid distribution in the lower limbs, to directly influence CSF and may be a promising countermeasure to help reduce increases in CSF.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to demonstrate the ability of lower body negative pressure to directly influence cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the optic nerve, indicating potential use as a countermeasure for increased cerebrospinal fluid on Earth or in space.

TI Current Use of Neuromuscular Blocking Agents in Intensive Care Units
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY AND REANIMATION
AB Neuromuscular blocking agents can be used for purposes such as eliminating ventilator-patient dyssynchrony, facilitating gas exchange by reducing intra-abdominal pressure and improving chest wall compliance, reducing risk of lung barotrauma, decreasing contribution of muscles to oxygen consumption by preventing shivering and limiting elevations in intracranial pressure caused by airway stimulation in patients supported with mechanical ventilation in intensive care units. Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), status asthmaticus, increased intracranial pressure and therapeutic hypothermia following ventricular fibrillation-associated cardiac arrest are some of clinical conditions that can be sustained by neuromuscular blockade. Appropriate indication and clinical practice have gained importance considering side effects such as ICU-acquired weakness, masking seizure activity and longer durations of hospital and ICU stays. We mainly aimed to review the current literature regarding neuromuscular blockade in up-to-date clinical conditions such as improving oxygenation in early ARDS and preventing shivering in the therapeutic hypothermia along with summarising the clinical practice in adult ICU in this report.

TI Recommendations for the selection and treatment of patients with
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension for venous sinus stenting
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Introduction Although venous sinus stenting (VSS) has emerged as a promising treatment option for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and associated venous sinus stenosis, there is considerable ambiguity regarding patient selection criteria, treatment protocols, and management strategies. Methods An extensive literature review was performed to identify all reports of VSS in patients with IIH using PubMed. Recommendations for the selection and treatment of patients with IIH with VSS are outlined as determined based on author opinion from supporting studies. Due to the lack of randomized trials and few published prospective studies, standard grading scales for recommendations and level of evidence are not fully applicable and therefore a revised grading scale has been provided for recommendations. Results The literature review identified a total of eight systematic reviews or meta-analyses and 29 published patient series on VSS. Recommendations for patient selection for diagnostic catheter angiography, angiography procedural considerations, stenting procedural considerations, and retreatment are provided based on the literature. Recommendations that were considered strong included: performance of venous sinus manometry to assess candidacy for treatment prior to stenting; administration of antiplatelet agents prior to stenting and for a follow-up period of at least 3-6 months; performance of post-stenting manometry to confirm resolution of pressure gradient; and performance of repeat angiography and manometry on patients with recurrence of symptoms after resolution with stenting to evaluate for recurrent stenosis. Conclusion VSS for patients with IIH with venous sinus stenosis is now an established and effective treatment option. These recommendations have been provided, based on a summative review of the available published literature, to assist in standardizing care for patients with IIH undergoing VSS.

TI The cerebrovascular response to lower-body negative pressure vs. head-up
   tilt
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) has been proposed as a MRI-compatible surrogate for orthostatic stress. Although the effects of LBNP on cerebral hemodynamic behavior have been considered to reflect those of orthostatic stress, a direct comparison with actual orthostasis is lacking. We assessed the effects of LBNP (-50 mmHg) vs. head-up tilt (HUT; at 70 degrees) in 10 healthy subjects (5 female) on transcranial Doppler-determined cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral artery and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) as estimated from the blood pressure signal (finger plethysmography). CPP was maintained during LBNP but decreased after 2 min in response to HUT, leading to an similar to 15% difference in CPP between LBNP and HUT (P <= 0.020). Mean CBFv initially decreased similarly in response to LBNP and for HUT, but, from minute 3 on, the decline became similar to 50% smaller (P <= 0.029) during LBNP. The reduction in end-tidal P-CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2) was comparable but with an earlier return toward baseline values in response to LBNP but not during HUT (P <= 0.008). We consider the larger decrease in CBFv during HUT vs. LBNP attributable to the pronounced reduction in PETCO2 and to gravitational influences on CPP, and this should be taken into account when applying LBNP as an MRI-compatible orthostatic stress modality.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) has the potential to serve as a MRI-compatible surrogate of orthostatic stress but a comparison with actual orthostasis was lacking. This study showed that the pronounced reduction in end-tidal P-CO2 together with gravitational effects on the brain circulation lead to a larger decline in cerebral blood flow velocity in response to head-up tilt than during lower-body negative pressure. This should be taken into account when employing lower-body negative pressure as MRI-compatible alternative to orthostatic stress.

TI Venous Sinuses Damage and Thrombosis after Craniocerebral Gunshot
   Injuries
SO NEUROSONOLOGY AND CEREBRAL HEMODYNAMICS
AB Cerebral venous occlusion (CVO) is unusual clinical event with various pathological manifestations. Appearance of clinical signs and extent of affected anatomical structures are related with death frequency, appr. 60%. Cascade development of the syndrome appears with focal neurological deficit, increased intracranial pressure, gradually alteration of the conscience and seizures. Computed tomography (CT) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigations (sample) are main tools of diagnostics. CVO syndrome management aims anticoagulant therapy and control of the intracranial pressure. Two patients who underwent craniocerebral gunshot injuries with direct damage of venous sinuses and venous sinuses thrombosis with good outcome are presented. CT angiography is of great value for diagnosis of CVO and estimation of the cerebral venous system as far as for evolution of effectiveness of the anticoagulant therapy. Good final results of treatment, without any changes in sinus thrombosis is due to rapid compensation of venous blood flow by anastomoses, "intracranial decompression" by CSF and cerebral detritus leakage, surgical and therapeutical control of the brain edema, despite of lack of effect of anticoagulant therapy in one of the patients.

TI MEGALENCEPHALY IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN - POSSIBLE ROLE OF INCREASED
   DURAL SINUS PRESSURE
SO ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY
AB Children (7): studied because of clinical macrocephaly and suspected hydrocephalus ultimately proved to have megalencephaly apparently due to an increase in sagittal sinus venous pressure as established from infusion studies. Unexplainably, these patients were all males. All were seen initially between 2 and 8 mo. of age. Head enlargement exceeded 2 standard deviations in all 7. Pneumoencephalography, ventriculography, or computerized tomography demonstrated normal or minimally enlarged ventricles that did not progress in size. Isotope cisternography was abnormal. Studies of CSF formation and absorption demonstrated normal absorption rates but high calculated sagittal sinus pressures. Though therapy was usually not required, in 1 unusual infant, severe progressive macrocephaly with minimal hydrocephalus required a shunt. Another had a transient episode of acute hydrocephalus associated with a low CSF absorption rate and ventricular enlargement. The intracranial hydrodynamics of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH), communicating hydrocephalus and the pathogenesis of megalencephaly was reviewed. Benign intracranial hypertension and the type of megalencephaly demonstrated by the patients appear to develop similarly except that the presence of open cranial sutures may allow a transient nonhydrostatic loading of brain parenchyma in infants, resulting in mild, nonprogressive macrocephaly.

TI Survey of intensive care of severely head injured patients in the United
   Kingdom
SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Objectives-To study practice in intensive care of patients with severe head injury in neurosurgical referral centres in United Kingdom.
   Design-Structured telephone interview of senior nursing staff in intensive care unit of adult neurosurgical referral centre.
   Setting-39 intensive care units in hospitals that accepted acute head injuries for specialist neurosurgical management, identified from Medical Directory and information from professional bodies.
   Main outcome measures-Details of organisation and administration of intensive care and patterns of monitoring and treatment for patients admitted with severe head injury.
   Results-Patients were managed in specialist neurosurgical intensive care units in 21 of the centres and in general intensive care units in 18. Their intensive care was coordinated by an anaesthetist in 25 units and by a neurosurgeon in 12. Annual caseload varied between units: 20 received >100 patients, 12 received 50-100, and seven received 25-49. Monitoring and treatment varied considerably between centres. Invasive arterial pressure monitoring was used routinely in 36 units, but central venous pressure monitoring was routinely used in 24 and intracranial pressure was routinely monitored in only 19. Corticosteroids were used to treat intracranial hypertension in 19 units. Seventeen units routinely aimed for arterial carbon dioxide pressure of 3.3-4.0 kPa, and one unit still used severe hyperventilation to a pressure of <3.3 kPa.
   Conclusion-The intensive care of patients with acute head injuries varied widely between the centres surveyed. Rationalisation of the intensive care of severe head injury with the production of widely accepted guidelines ought to improve the quality of care.

TI The effect of suction catheter insertion and tracheal stimulation in
   adults with severe brain injury
SO HEART & LUNG
AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of suction catheter insertion and tracheal stimulation on cerebrovascular and systemic vascular status in adults with severe traumatic brain injury. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, within-subject design.
   SETTING: Two university-affiliated critical care units.
   SUBJECTS: Thirty intubated and mechanically ventilated adults with severe brain injury. The participants' average age was 31 +/- 15 years.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean intracranial pressure (MICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and heart rate (HR) were measured.
   INTERVENTION: Endotracheal suction catheter insertion with tracheal stimulation was performed.
   RESULTS: Suction catheter insertion and tracheal stimulation, isolated from other components of the suctioning procedure, significantly increased MICP, MAP, and CPP. KR was not significantly increased. During the application of negative pressure for actual suctioning, MICP and HR significantly increased, whereas MAP and CPP did not significantly change compared with catheter insertion.
   CONCLUSION: Tracheal stimulation during suction catheter insertion initiates both cerebrovascular and systemic vascular responses during the suctioning procedure. Study findings suggest that a potentially productive direction for intervention research is to identify ways to minimize airway stimulation during the suctioning procedure.

AB Pseudotumor cerebri remains a scarcely known pathology. We present the experience of a multidisciplinary working group which studied this disorder focusing on the venous alterations of the dural sinuses.
   Seventeen cases were studied, diagnosed, controlled and treated by our team. In one of the cases, we placed a stent in the left lateral sinus with good result.
   In all the patients we observed various degrees of stenosis in the brain venous sinuses quantified by pressure measurement. Nevertheless, to determine the exact cause of this pathology, more studies are necessary.

TI Cardiopulmonary hemodynamic changes during acute subdural hematoma
   evacuation
SO NEUROLOGIA MEDICO-CHIRURGICA
AB The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of hemodynamic changes leading to intraoperative hypotension during evacuation of acute subdural hematoma. To our knowledge, little data is available about the mechanism of hemodynamic changes during surgical interventions to decrease intracranial pressure after severe head injury. The influence of preoperative hypotension on intraoperative hypotension was examined. Hemodynamic studies (pulmonary artery catheterization) were carried out in 15 patients before and after acute subdural hematoma evacuation. All patients were assessed for hemodynamic parameters, evacuated hematoma volume, and intracranial pressure measurements. Comparison between just before and after evacuation of the hematoma showed that the mean arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure all decreased after hematoma evacuation. However, the cardiac index was unchanged after hematoma evacuation. Mean arterial blood pressure is dependent on the cardiac index and vascular resistance, so the decrease in arterial blood pressure during hematoma evacuation was the result of a decline in vascular resistance. The influence of preoperative blood pressure on intraoperative hemodynamic changes was analyzed by dividing the patients into two groups, the preoperative hypotension group and preoperative non-hypotension group. The decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was more marked in the preoperative hypotension group than in the preoperative nonhypotension group. Intraoperative hypotension during evacuation of acute subdural hematoma is caused by a decrease in vascular resistance. Preoperative hypotension is a also risk factor for intraoperative hypotension.

TI COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF DMSO AND PENTOBARBITAL ON EXPERIMENTAL
   BRAIN EDEMA
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB The effects of acute therapy with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and pentobarbitone on experimental brain edema produced by a cryogenic lesion over the left hemisphere in albino rabbits were compared. One group received DMSO (1 mg/kg, 10% solution) by i.v. bolus, and an other group received a pentobarbitone i.v. 30-min infusion (40 mg/kg). Intracranial pressure (ICP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and EEG were studied. Brain water and electrolyte content were analyzed 1 h following the initiation of therapy. ICP was promptly reduced with both forms of therapy. A 66% reduction from control values was reached at 50 .+-. 12 min with pentobarbitone, and a 45% reduction from control values was reached at 30 min with DMSO. There was no significant reduction in the water content of the brain with either form of therapy. A significant elevation in brain K+ content was noted following DMSO when compared to untreated controls. CVP was essentially unchanged in both groups. Pentobarbitone produced a reduction of SAP with a mean value of 20.3 torr at 45 min from infusion. DMSO produced no reduction of SAP. Evidently DMSO and pentobarbitone are equally effective in reducing ICP. DMSO maintains SAP while pentobarbitone does not, thus assuring a better cerebral perfusion pressure.

TI Clinical review: the surgical treatment of idiopathic pseudotumour
   cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
SO CEPHALALGIA
AB To review the literature on the surgical treatment of idiopathic pseudotumour cerebri (PTC) [idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)]. When medical therapy fails or when visual dysfunction deteriorates, surgical therapies for PTC should be considered. The main procedures performed include lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) and optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF). Recently, venous sinus stenting procedures have been performed on selected patients with PTC, especially those with venous sinus occlusive disease. The literature is summarized and appraised in the form of a narrative review. It is evident that ONSF, LPS, VPS and, in selected cases, venous sinus stenting may improve vision and prevent deterioration of vision in patients with PTC. All of the procedures have their advantages and disadvantages and may fail with time no matter what procedure is used. Various authorities have vehemently advocated one or the other of these procedures. Until a prospective, randomized study comparing ONSF with LPS or VPS for PTC is performed, and until the role of venous sinus obstruction as the aetiology of PTC is better defined, the question of which surgical procedure is best for the treatment of PTC remains unanswered.

TI Hindbrain-related syringomyelia and raised intra-abdominal pressure:
   implications for safety of laparoscopic and robotic surgery
SO ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
AB BACKGROUND: The causative role played by intra-abdominal pressure (LAP) in the syringogenesis of the Chiari 1 malformation syringomyelia has been still not adequately studied. The aim of this study is to validate the transmedullary theory about the hindbrain-related syrinx, also discussing the implications for safety of these patients related to the use of high-pressure CO2 pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic and robotic surgery.
   METHODS: Fourteen patients with a hindbrain-related syrinx were candidate for a posterior fossa decompression. Preoperative and follow-up protocol involved conventional T1/T2 and cardiac-gated Cine phase-contrast MRI sequences. Peak systolic and diastolic velocities were acquired at four Regions Of Interests (ROI), namely syrinx, ventral and dorsal cervical subarachnoid space, and foramen magnum region. Data were reported as mean +/- SD. Patients were followed for three years. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test of multiple comparisons were performed, where p-value was <0.001.
   RESULTS: A systolic-diastolic pulsatile pattern of CSF was found in all cases inside the syrinx. Syrinx and premedullary cistern velocities decreased within the first month after surgery (<0.001). All symptoms apart from atrophy and spasticity improved. These data lead to validate the Oldfield and Heiss transmedullary theory about syringogenesis, within which an increased LAP play a key role.
   CONCLUSION: Raised LAP plays a paramount role in the formation and maintenance of the hindbrain-related syrinx. High-pressure CO2 surgical pneumoperitoneum is strongly discouraged in these patients because at risk of rapid neurological worsening. A low-pressure insufflation technique has a rationale in those patients having smaller or incidental syrinxes.

TI Hydrocephalus in craniosynostosis:: a review
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Introduction: Ventricular dilatation in the presence of primary craniosynostosis is a unique condition with respect to pathogenesis, clinical significance, and morphological appearance. It is rarely observed in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, and in these cases usually attributable to coincidental disorders. Conversely, it is a common feature of syndromic craniosynostosis, affecting at least 40% of patients with Crouzon's, Pfeiffer's or the Apert syndrome. Shunt-dependent hydrocephalus is predominantly associated with Crouzon or Pfeiffer syndrome while in the Apert syndrome the usual finding is nonprogressive ventriculomegaly which, however, may also occur in some cases of Crouzon syndrome. Pathogenesis: The pathogenesis of progressive hydrocephalus remains somewhat obscure, a hypoplastic posterior fossa and a venous outlet occlusion at the skull base being the main causative factors discussed in literature. Ventriculomegaly may reflect primary brain maldevelopment or in some cases even a compensated state of increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow resistance. Clinical evaluation: Clinical evaluation is mainly aimed at identifying progressive hydrocephalus, but diagnosis is hampered by the fact that classical clinical signs may be absent, and that ventricular dilatation will often become evident only after decompressive cranial surgery. Moreover, mild ventriculomegaly may in some cases coexist with intracranial hypertension from craniostenosis. Therefore, careful monitoring of intracranial pressure and ventricular size in the pre- and postoperative period is a diagnostic mainstay. Conclusion: In true hydrocephalus ventriculo-peritoneal shunting is currently the single promising mode of treatment.

TI Intracranial venous stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION ONCOLOGY
AB IntroductionThere is increasing evidence in the literature to support venous sinus stenting in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension who fail first-line therapy. Venous sinus stenting is a safe and successful technique compared with cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures. This study examines the clinical outcomes of patients post intracranial venous stenting for intracranial hypertension across three tertiary hospitals in Western Australia. MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on 83 consecutive patients treated with intracranial venous stenting for IIH at three tertiary hospitals from October 2013 to March 2020. Data were collected from outpatient clinic letters, electronic discharge letters, electronic radiological imaging and procedural reports. Results89.2% patients were able to cease Acetazolomide post stenting. 78.3% patients reported resolution of headaches. 84.3% patients demonstrated resolution of their papilloedema. 91.6% patients demonstrated improvement of their visual acuity. Compared with a recent meta-analysis by Satti and Chaudry in 2015, our results demonstrated a higher technical success rate and lower complication rates. ConclusionOur study findings support the paradigm shift from CSF diversion procedures to venous sinus stenting in patients with IIH who fail first-line therapy. Venous sinus stenting has a high technical success rate and significantly lower complication rates than other invasive treatments.

TI Evaluation of clinical predictors of postoperative outcomes in tegmen
   defect patients with and without concurrent superior semicircular canal
   dehiscence and cerebrospinal fluid leak
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY
AB Objectives: Tegmen and superior semicircular canal defects have been well studied, yet the factors contributing to their onset and progression are widely debated. The clinical utility of intraoperative intracranial pressure measurements has yet to be tested. This report aims to use intraoperative opening pressure and concurrent superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) to analyze factors influencing disease course and clinical outcomes in patients with tegmen dehiscence. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 61 patients who underwent tegmen defect repair was performed. Multiple variables of interest including body mass index (BMI), presence of SSCD, presence of dural venous sinus stenosis, opening pressure, and acetazolamide therapy use were recorded. The cohort was divided into those with or without concurrent SSCD and those presenting with or without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak for analysis. Results: A linear relationship between opening pressure and BMI (p = 0.009) was noted; however, intraoperative opening pressure was not associated with disease outcome. Concurrent SSCD was present in 25 % of patients, while 62 % presented with CSF leak. The concurrent SSCD group exhibited higher opening pressure, higher likelihood of having dural sinus stenosis, and higher likelihood of being discharged on acetazolamide. The CSF leak group had higher likelihood of obstructive sleep apnea and persistent symptoms. Conclusions: In patients undergoing tegmen defect repair, concurrent SSCD suggests increased disease severity. The presence of preoperative CSF leak predicts persistent symptoms following repair. BMI is linearly correlated with intracranial pressure in these patients.

TI Meta-Analysis of CSF Diversion Procedures and Dural Venous Sinus
   Stenting in the Setting of Medically Refractory Idiopathic Intracranial
   Hypertension
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension, optic nerve sheath fenestration or CSF shunting is considered the next line of management. Venous sinus stenosis has been increasingly recognized as a treatable cause of elevated intracranial pressure in a subset of patients. In this article, we present the results of the largest meta-analysis of optic nerve sheath fenestration, CSF shunting, and dural venous sinus stenting. This is the only article that compares these procedures, to our knowledge.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a PubMed search of all peer-reviewed articles from 1988 to 2014 for patients who underwent a procedure for medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
   RESULTS: Optic nerve sheath fenestration analysis included 712 patients. Postprocedure, there was improvement of vision in 59%, headache in 44%, and papilledema in 80%; 14.8% of patients required a repeat procedure with major and minor complication rates of 1.5% and 16.4%, respectively. The CSF diversion procedure analysis included 435 patients. Postprocedure, there was improvement of vision in 54%, headache in 80%, and papilledema in 70%; 43% of patients required at least 1 additional surgery. The major and minor complication rates were 7.6% and 32.9%, respectively. The dural venous sinus stenting analysis included 136 patients. After intervention, there was improvement of vision in 78%, headache in 83%, and papilledema in 97% of patients. The major and minor complication rates were 2.9% and 4.4%, respectively. Fourteen additional procedures were performed with a repeat procedure rate of 10.3%. Three patients had contralateral stent placement, while 8 had ipsilateral stent placement within or adjacent to the original stent. Only 3 patients required conversion to CSF diversion or 2.2% of patients with stents.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension have traditionally undergone a CSF diversion procedure as the first intervention. This paradigm may need to be re-examined, given the high technical and clinical success and low complication rates with dural venous sinus stenting.

TI Prediction of Venous Trans-Stenotic Pressure Gradient Using Shape
   Features Derived From Magnetic Resonance Venography in Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension Patients
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB Objective: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology associated with venous sinus stenosis. This study aimed to develop a magnetic resonance venography (MRV)-based radiomics model for predicting a high trans-stenotic pressure gradient (TPG) in IIH patients diagnosed with venous sinus stenosis. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 105 IIH patients (median age [interquartile range], 35 years [27- 42 years]; female:male, 82:23) who underwent MRV and catheter venography complemented by venous manometry. Contrast enhanced-MRV was conducted under 1.5 Tesla system, and the images were reconstructed using a standard algorithm. Shape features were derived from MRV images via the PyRadiomics package and selected by utilizing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. A radiomics score for predicting high TPG (>= 8 mmHg) in IIH patients was formulated using multivariable logistic regression; its discrimination performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). A nomogram was constructed by incorporating the radiomics scores and clinical features. Results: Data from 105 patients were randomly divided into two distinct datasets for model training (n = 73; 50 and 23 with and without high TPG, respectively) and testing (n = 32; 22 and 10 with and without high TPG, respectively). Three informative shape features were identified in the training datasets: least axis length, sphericity, and maximum three-dimensional diameter. The radiomics score for predicting high TPG in IIH patients demonstrated an AUROC of 0.906 (95% confidence interval, 0.836- 0.976) in the training dataset and 0.877 (95% confidence interval, 0.755-0.999) in the test dataset. The nomogram showed good calibration. Conclusion: Our study presents the feasibility of a novel model for predicting high TPG in IIH patients using radiomics analysis of noninvasive MRV-based shape features. This information may aid clinicians in identifying patients who may benefit from stenting.

TI The role of intracranial hypertension in the chronification of migraine
SO NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Besides a similar clinical presentation, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and chronic migraine (CM) also share relevant risk factors, show a higher prevalence of allodynic symptoms and both respond to topiramate. Moreover, sinus stenosis, a radiological marker of IIH, in CM patients is much more prevalent than expected. As a consequence of these striking similarities, IIH without papilledema (IIHWOP) may be easily misdiagnosed as CM. Actually, IIHWOP has been found in up to 14 % of CM clinical series. Considering that, on one hand, an asymptomatic sinus stenosis-associated raised intracranial pressure (ICP) may be highly prevalent in the general population, and on the other, that IIH clinical presentation with chronic headache may require a migraine predisposition, we have proposed that an overlooked IIHWOP could represent a risk factor for migraine progression. This hypothesis prompted us to investigate the prevalence of IIHWOP and its possible role in the process of migraine chronification in a consecutive series of CM patients selected for unresponsiveness to medical treatment and evidence of significant sinus stenosis. The main finding of our study is that the large majority of such patients actually suffer from a chronic headache secondary to IIHWOP. This implies that an IIHWOP mimicking CM is much more prevalent than believed, is commonly misdiagnosed as CM on the basis of ICHD criteria and is strictly predicted by refractoriness to preventive treatments. However, our data fully comply with the alternative hypothesis that an overlooked IIHWOP, although highly prevalent amongst healthy individuals, in migraine-prone subjects is a powerful (and modifiable) risk factor for the progression and the refractoriness of pain. The normalization of ICP by even a single LP with CSF withdrawal may be effective in a significant proportion of patients with a long history of refractory chronic headache, who represent about one-fifth of the patients screened in our study. We suggest that IIHWOP should be considered in all patients with almost daily migraine pain, with evidence of sinus stenosis and unresponsive to medical treatment, referred to specialized headache clinics.

TI Visual disturbances during prolonged space missions
SO CURRENT OPINION IN OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Purpose of review During prolonged spaceflight, astronauts often experience ocular changes, due to constant head-ward fluid shifts in space as compared with Earth. This article reviews symptoms, likely causes, and potential solutions, such as lower body negative pressure, to counteract space-associated neuroocular syndrome (SANS). Recent findings Low gravity conditions and other aspects of spaceflight affect the eye detrimentally, causing SANS which is characterized by optic disc edema, choroidal thickening, cotton wool spots, and a hyperopic shift. SANS is probably caused by altered hemodynamic flows in the head and neck as well as mildly elevated intracranial and intraocular pressures. Carbon dioxide and other chemicals in space-craft may influence SANS as well. SANS may be counteracted by using lower body negative pressure, thigh cuffs, spacecraft engineering, and/or artificial gravity by a centrifuge. Prolonged space missions are associated with optic disc edema, choroidal thickening, cotton wool spots, and a hyperopic shift. Possible causes and countermeasures are currently being researched to reduce the risk of SANS. Although many countermeasures to SANS are under investigation lower body negative pressure exhibits great promise in counteracting the headward fluid shifts in space. Understanding and prevention of SANS is critical to future space exploration, especially to long-duration missions to the moon and Mars.

TI Pearls & Oy-sters: Cerebral Venous Congestion Associated With Cognitive
   Decline Treated by Jugular Release
SO NEUROLOGY
AB Cognitive dysfunction is often multifaceted and can be seen across all age groups in medicine. The combination of cognitive decline and increased intracranial pressure may suggest possible anatomical abnormalities. We present a case report from our academic center that describes a young man with new cognitive fatigue and brain fog in the setting of increased venous pressure that resolved with surgical intervention at a site of jugular vein stenosis. We discuss current hypotheses from basic and clinical research related to pathophysiology underlying venous vascular congestion and associated neurologic disorders. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of venous congestion and cognition to better identify therapies and improve quality of life for patients.
   Pearls
   Dynamic venography performed with provocative neck maneuvers and measurement of torcular pressure will identify at-risk patients with suspected cerebral venous congestion.
   An elevated cerebral venous pressure gradient by the transverse process of C1 can be reduced by C1 tuberculectomy.
   Oy-sters
   In patients presenting with suspected abnormal intracranial pressure and new cognitive decline, the possibility of cerebral venous congestion (CVC) from stenosis or obstruction should be considered.
   Cognitive decline is often irreversible in several neurologic conditions; however, symptoms secondary to CVC can be reversed when promptly intervened.
   Case Report
   A 30-year-old man without prior medical diagnosis presented to the emergency department with a new, persistent headache. He described the headache as a pressure-like sensation, worse while standing, associated with gait imbalance, and resolving when supine without moving his head. Over-the-counter medications provided minimal relief of symptoms. One month before his presentation, he suffered a ground-level fall from his mountain bike, resulting in minor head trauma without loss of consciousness. He was wearing a helmet during the fall. Three days before his presentation, he developed a new, persistent headache while riding his bike. He denied a history of headaches, blurry vision, or weakness. A review of systems was positive for back and neck pain. His neurologic examination was unremarkable, and he was referred to neurology for the evaluation of postconcussive headache.

TI Introduction to monitoring in the neurological intensive care unit and
   its future impact
SO NEUROLOGIST
AB BACKGROUND- Effective management of the medical and surgical aspects of patients who are treated in neurological intensive care units (NICUs) depends on periodic neurological assessment of brain function. This assessment can be aided by application of various monitoring tools on a periodic or continuous basis.
   REVIEW SUMMARY- Intracranial pressure monitoring is standard in NICUs and allows for the continuous measurement of cerebral perfusion pressure. Transcranial Doppler can provide information about pending cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage and can measure cerebral vasoreactivity. Jugular venous oximetry monitoring has been applied to patients with head injury. Paired measurement of both intracranial pressure and jugular venous oxygen content provides useful information to manage blood pressure, ventilation, and osmotherapy in patients with head injury. Continuous EEG may identify unsuspected nonconvulsive status epilepticus and when applied to all NICU patients may provide important information for medical decision making. Evoked potentials are useful in establishing prognosis for both adults and neonates.
   CONCLUSIONS- The continuous measure of brain function of patients in NICUs is technologically feasible and devices that provide this information in real time are now commercially available. It is hoped that these devices can improve patient outcome and hospital efficiency.

TI Dural venous sinus stenting for medically and surgically refractory
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a syndrome defined by elevated intracranial hypertension without radiographic evidence of a mass lesion in the brain. Dural venous sinus stenosis has been increasingly recognized as a treatable cause, and dural venous sinus stenting (DVSS) is increasingly performed.
   Methods: A 5 year single-center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing DVSS for medically refractory IIH.
   Results: There were 43 patients with a mean imaging follow-up of 6.5 months and a mean clinical follow-up period of 13.5 months. DVSS was performed as the first procedure for medically refractory IIH in 81.4% of patients, whereas 18.6% of patients included had previously had a surgical procedure (ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt or optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF)). Headache was present in all patients and after DVSS improved or remained stable in 69.2% and 30.8%, respectively. Visual acuity changes and visual field changes were present in 88.4% and 37.2% of patients, respectively. Visual field improved or remained unchanged in 92%, but worsened in 8% after stenting. There was a stent patency rate of 81.8%, with an 18.2% re-stenosis rate. Of the 43 procedures performed, there was a 100% technical success rate with zero major or minor complications.
   Conclusion: Based on this single-center retrospective analysis, DVSS can be performed with high technical success and low complication rates. A majority of patients presented primarily with headache, and these patients had excellent symptom relief with DVSS alone. Patients presenting with visual symptoms had lower success rates, and this population, if stented, should be carefully followed for progression of symptoms.

TI Abdominal compartment syndrome
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Background Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a systemic syndrome involving derangement in cardiovascular haemodynamics, respiratory and renal functions as a result of sustained increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) ending in multi-organ failure. It is a life threatening emergency and requires prompt action and treatment. For the last 20 years,there has been more awareness among surgeons and intensivists of ACS being a distinct disease entity but still widespread ignorance prevails. Presentation can be acute, chronic and acute on chronic. Initial diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by measurement of IAP. Treatment is abdominal decompression by laparostomy and delayed abdominal closure. Despite prompt treatment mortality remains high. Awareness among surgeons has increased because laparoscopy has resulted in determination of IAP as a readily measurable quantity and also they have been able to appreciate the benefit of abdominal decompression by performing repeated planned laparotomies for trauma.
   Methods A medline, pubmed and Cochrane database search was performed and the articles found were cross referenced.
   Results and conclusion Clinical diagnosis is not easy and serial urinary bladder pressure (UBP) monitoring leads to early diagnosis. Treatment is by laprostomy to decompress the abdomen followed by delayed abdominal closure.

TI Development of an Intracranial Dural Arteriovenous Fistula after Venous
   Sinus Stenting for Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB We report a case in which an intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) developed after endovascular treatment of a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with venous sinus stenting (VSS). The pathogenesis may involve hemodynamic alterations secondary to increased poststenting venous sinus pressure, which may cause new arterial ingrowth into the fistulous sinus wall without capillary interposition. Despite administration of dual antiplatelet therapy, there may also be subclinical cortical vein thrombosis that contributed to DAVF formation. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, increased inflammation induced by VSS may upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor expression and also promote DAVF pathogenesis. Since VSS has been used to obliterate DAVFs, DAVF formation after VSS may seem counterintuitive. Previous stents have generally been closed cell, stainless steel designs used to maximize radial compression of the fistulous sinus wall. In contrast, our patient's stent was an open cell, self-expandable nitinol design (Protege Everflex). Neurointerventionalists should be aware of this potential, although rare complication of DAVF formation after VSS.

TI Spontaneous Skull Base Cerebrospinal Fluid Leaks and Their Relationship
   to Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY
AB Background The association between spontaneous skull base cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has been suggested, but its significance remains unclear. Objective To estimate the prevalence of IIH in spontaneous skull base CSF leak patients. Methods Systematic collection of demographics, neuro-ophthalmic and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of spontaneous skull base CSF leak patients seen pre- and post-leak repair in one neuro-ophthalmology service. Patients with preexisting IIH were diagnosed with definite IIH if adequate documentation was provided; otherwise, they were categorized with presumed IIH. Classic radiographic signs of intracranial hypertension and bilateral transverse venous sinus stenosis were recorded. Results Thirty six patients were included (age [interquartile range]: 50 [45;54] years; 94% women; body mass index: 36.8 [30.5;39.9] kg/m2), among whom six (16.7%, [95% confidence interval, CI]: [6.4;32.8]) had a preexisting diagnosis of definite or presumed IIH. Of the remaining 30 patients, four (13.3%, 95%CI: [3.8;30.7]) had optic nerve head changes suggesting previously undiagnosed IIH, while one was newly diagnosed with definite IIH at initial consultation. One out of 29 patients with normal findings of the optic nerve head at presentation developed new onset papilledema following surgery (3.4%, 95%CI: [0.1;17.8]) and was ultimately diagnosed with definite IIH. Overall, the prevalence of definite IIH was 19.4% (95%CI: [8.2;36.0]). Conclusion Striking demographic overlap exists between IIH patients and those with spontaneous CSF leak. Definite IIH was present in approximately 20% of our patients. However, its true prevalence is likely higher than identified by using classic criteria. We therefore hypothesize that an active CSF leak serves as an auto-diversion for CSF, thereby "treating" the intracranial hypertension and eliminating characteristic signs and symptoms at initial presentation.

TI Neurovascular Interventions for Neurotrauma: From Treatment of Injured
   Vessels to Treatment of the Injured Brain?
SO OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY
AB Traumatic brain injury is often associated with a direct or secondary neurovascular pathology. In this review, we present recent advancements in endovascular neurosurgery that enable accurate and effective vessel reconstruction with emphasis on its role in early diagnosis, the expanding use of flow diversion in pseudoaneurysms, and traumatic arteriovenous fistulas. In addition, future directions in which catheter-based interventions could potentially affect traumatic brain injury are described: targeting blood brain barrier integrity using the advantages of intra-arterial drug delivery of blood brain barrier stabilizers to prevent secondary brain edema, exploring the impact of endovascular venous access as a means to modulate venous outflow in an attempt to reduce intracranial pressure and augment brain perfusion, applying selective intra-arterial hypothermia as a neuroprotection method mitigating some of the risks conferred by systemic cooling, trans-vessel wall delivery of regenerative therapy agents, and shifting attention using multimodal neuromonitoring to post-traumatic vasospasm to further characterize the role it plays in secondary brain injury. Thus, we believe that the potential of endovascular tools can be expanded because they enable access to the "highways" governing perfusion and flow and call for further research focused on exploring these routes because it may contribute to novel endovascular approaches currently used for treating injured vessels, harnessing them for treatment of the injured brain.

TI Postural influence on intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressure in
   ambulatory neurosurgical patients
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY
AB We evaluated postural effects on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure [CPP: mean arterial pressure (MAP) - ICP] in neurosurgical patients undergoing 24-h ICP monitoring as part of their diagnostic workup. We identified nine patients (5 women, age 44 +/- 20 yr; means +/- SD), who were "as normal as possible," i.e., without indication for neurosurgical intervention (e.g., focal lesions, global edema, abnormalities in ICP-profile, or cerebrospinal fluid dynamics). ICP (tip-transducer probe; Raumedic) in the brain parenchyma (n = 7) or in the lateral ventricles (n = 2) and cardiovascular variables (Nexfin) were determined from 20 degrees head-down tilt to standing up. Compared with the supine position, ICP increased during 10 +/- and 20 +/- of head-down tilt (from 9.4 +/- 3.8 to 14.3 +/- 4.7 and 19 +/- 4.7 mmHg; P +/- 0.001). Conversely, 10 degrees and 20 degrees head-up tilt reduced ICP to 4.8 +/- 3.6 and 1.3 +/- 3.6 mmHg and ICP reached -2.4 +/- 4.2 mmHg in the standing position (P < 0.05). Concordant changes in MAP maintained CPP at 77 +/- 7 mmHg regardless of body position (P = 0.95). During head-down tilt, the increase in ICP corresponded to a hydrostatic pressure gradient with reference just below the heart, likely reflecting the venous hydrostatic indifference point. When upright, the decrease in ICP was attenuated, corresponding to formation of a separate hydrostatic gradient with reference to the base of the skull, likely reflecting the site of venous collapse. ICP therefore seems to be governed by pressure in the draining veins and collapse of neck veins may protect the brain from being exposed to a large negative pressure when upright. Despite positional changes in ICP, MAP keeps CPP tightly regulated.

AB We report what we believe to be the first case of restenosis of the sigmoid sinus after stenting, in a 42-year-old man with an arteriovenous malformation with progressive right hemiparesis secondary to venous hypertension. Angiography revealed severe stenosis of the left sigmoid sinus, which was dilated with a self-expandable stent. Six months after the procedure, however, the sinus was again severely stenosed. Intravascular sonography revealed intimal proliferation in the stented sinus. It was dilated percutaneously, and the venous pressure decreased from 51 to 33 mmHg. On sonography, the intimal tissue decreased in thickness and the diameter of the stent enlarged a little.

TI Chronic intracranial hypertension after cerebral venous and sinus
   thrombosis - frequency and risk factors
SO NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
AB BackgroundCerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) can infrequently lead to chronical intracranial hypertension (IH) due to the altered venous drainage. The aim of this study was to ascertain the risk of IH after CVST and to stratify underlying risk factors.MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all cases treated for acute CVST at our department between 2013 and 2019. IH was diagnosed at follow-up according to the modified Dandy criteria. CVST-patients with and without IH were descriptively compared conforming to available clinical and radiological data as well as outcomes.ResultsOur study included 102 patients with acute CVST. In 70 cases complete follow-up data was available (68.6%). Seven of these patients developed symptomatic intracranial hypertension (10%; N = 7, n = 70) within a median follow-up of 6 months. Four of these patients (57.1% (N = 4, n = 7) vs. 3.2% (N = 2, n = 63); p < 0.001) presented recurrent sinus thrombosis in the further course. There were no significant differences between patients with or without IH concerning gender, age, risk factors, occluded vessels and treatment for their CVST. However the presence of visual deterioration at initial admission was higher in patients who developed IH afterwards (57.1% (N = 4, n = 7) vs. 20.6% (N = 13, n = 63); p = 0.03). Patients with chronic IH after CVST showed significantly less likely recanalization of the occluded vessel on follow-up MRI (no recanalization in 28.6% (N = 2, n = 7) vs. 4.8% (N = 3, n = 63); p = 0.02). All patients with IH had a good outcome (mRS 0-2) at discharge and follow-up.ConclusionIH occurred in around 10% after CVST. Insufficient recanalization status may facilitate IH. Patients with visual disturbances seem to develop more likely IH afterwards. Patients who present IH after CVST may develop recurrent cerebral venous thrombosis.

TI Contemporary management of the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB Introduction: Diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome are imperative to prevent or minimize permanent visual loss and headache-related disability. Areas covered: Steps in management, including making the correct diagnosis, techniques to assess the patient's visual status, medical treatment of intracranial hypertension and the associated headaches, weight management strategies, surgical treatments and stenting are reviewed incorporating the most recent medical evidence. Expert opinion: As the pathogenesis of the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome is still unknown, many of the currently employed management strategies incorporate a 'plumbing approach' to decrease cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Trial (IIHTT) taught us that the disorder markedly affects visual and overall quality of life, and that reducing pressure alone is not enough to make patients well, even those considered to have 'mild' vision loss. Other than the IIHTT, the evidence supporting the use of various treatments is meager. The course of the disorder can be unpredictable, and the clinician(s) managing these patients are often uncertain about which treatments to employ. Moreover, the desired modalities and specialists are not universally available in all locations. An individualized and detailed approach to the various manifestations and nuances of the disorder is essential.

AB Background Increased intra-abdominal pressure has been reported to result in raised intracranial pressure in a variety of conditions such as obesity and pregnancy, and it also constitutes an infrequent cause of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt malfunction. Patients with neurological deficits, as those with myelomeningocele or cerebral palsy, are prone to developing a neurogenic bowel and to suffer chronic constipation. Although previously recognized, VP shunt failure attributed to constipation has only recently been described. We briefly review the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and management of severe constipation leading to VP shunt malfunction. Our aim is to draw the attention of pediatric neurosurgeons towards severe constipation as a possible cause of VP shunt failure thus avoiding unnecessary surgical valve revisions, to which children with hydrocephalus are often submitted to.
   Illustrative cases We report two children that developed transient VP shunt failure because of intense constipation that caused exacerbation of previously shunted hydrocephalus. One of the patients constitutes the first description of this complication associated with an anteriorly placed anus and the other with intestinal paresis after ileostomy. Conservative treatment aimed at alleviating the increased intra-abdominal pressure resulted in complete resolution of the children's manifestations of VP shunt failure, without having to resort to surgical revision of the VP shunt.

TI Progress in Clinical Application of Positive End-Expiratory Pressure
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB In the surgery patient under general anesthesia doesn't breathe spontaneously, and lung movement is completely dependent on the mechanical ventilation of the anesthesia machine. In order to achieve effective and safe mechanical ventilation of the patient's lungs during the operation, the concept of lung protective ventilation strategy (LPVS) was proposed, that is, the use of a low tidal volume and an appropriate level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to reduce alveolar overexpansion and prevent alveolar collapse. In the past, PEEP was an important measure to treat acute lung injury(ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) by improving oxygenation and reducing pulmonary edema. Subsequent studies found that PEEP not only be used to treat patients with ALI or ARDS, but also can reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications(PPCs) in some thoracoabdominal operations. Moreover, PEEP can prevent atelectasis during and after surgery in patients undergoing thoracic and abdominal surgery under general anesthesia, and decrease the incidence of postoperative infection. However, PEEP can affect venous return by increasing intrathoracic pressure, thereby causing changes in heart function and hemodynamics, and indirectly affecting intracranial pressure and renal function. Therefore, with the widespread clinical application of PEEP, more and more people are starting to focus on how to choose the appropriate PEEP. This article reviews the research progress of PEEP selection method, the influence of PEEP on physiological function and the clinical application of PEEP during mechanical ventilation.

TI Extreme lateral infracondylar approach for internal jugular vein
   compression syndrome: A case series with preliminary clinical outcomes
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Background and objectivesInternal jugular vein (IJV) stenosis is associated with several neurological disorders including idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and pulsatile tinnitus. In cases of extreme bony compression causing stenosis in the infracondylar region, surgical decompression might be necessary. We aim to examine the safety and efficacy of surgical IJV decompression.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed patients who received surgical IJV decompression via the extreme lateral infracondylar (ELI) approach between July 2020 and February 2022.ResultsFourteen patients with IJV stenosis were identified, all with persistent headache and/or tinnitus. Six patients were diagnosed with IIH, three of whom failed previous treatment. Of the eight remaining patients, two failed previous treatment. All underwent surgical IJV decompression via styloidectomy, release of soft tissue, and removal of the C1 transverse process (TP). Follow-up imaging showed significant improvement of IJV stenosis in eleven patients and mild improvement in three. Eight patients had significant improvement in their presenting symptoms, and three had partial improvement. Two patients received IJV stenting after a lack of initial improvement. Two patients experienced cranial nerve paresis, and one developed a superficial wound infection.ConclusionThe ELI approach for IJV decompression appears to be safe for patients who are not ideal endovascular candidates due to bony anatomy. Confirming long-term efficacy in relieving debilitating clinical symptoms requires longer follow-up and a larger patient cohort. Carefully selected patients with symptomatic bony IJV compression for whom there are no effective medical or endovascular options may benefit from surgical IJV decompression.

TI SUPRATENTORIAL ARACHNOID CYSTS IN ADULTS - DISCUSSION OF 2 CASES FROM A
   PATHO-PHYSIOLOGIC AND SURGICAL PERSPECTIVE
SO ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY
AB Large congenital arachnoid cysts are a rare cause of increased intracranial pressure and progressive neurologic deficits in adult life. Two patients were diagnosed by computerized axial tomography and surgically treated. The pertinent medical literature was reviewed. The outer cyst membranes were excised, and a communication between cyst and subarachnoid space was established. When possible, the membranes and fluid content of these lesions should be studied. This fluid is best obtained by aspiration prior to dural incision. At present, 3 etiologic mechanisms of cyst enlargement appear tenable: secretion of fluid by ependymal cells, fluid ingress due to an osmotic gradient, and finally trapping of fluid by a ball-valve mechanism. Regardless of the reasons why these lesions enlarge, drainage of cyst content into the venous system warrants a clinical consideration.

TI Optimal temperature for the management of severe traumatic brain injury:
   Effect of hypothermia on intracranial pressure, systemic and
   intracranial hemodynamics, and metabolism
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of hypothermia on intracranial pressure, systemic and intracranial hemodynamics, and metabolism in patients with severe traumatic brain injury to clarify the optimal temperature for hypothermia, with a view toward establishing the proper management techniques for such patients.
   METHODS: The study was performed in 31 patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score as high as 5). All patients were sedated, paralyzed, ventilated, and cooled to 33 degrees C. Brain temperature, core temperature, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, jugular venous oxygen saturation, mixed venous oxygen saturation, cardiac output, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and resting energy expenditure were monitored continuously.
   RESULTS: Intracranial pressure decreased significantly at brain temperatures below 37 degrees C and decreased more sharply at temperatures 35 to 360 degrees C, but no differences were observed at temperatures below 35 degrees C. Cerebral perfusion pressure peaked at 35.0 to 35.9C and decreased with further decreases in temperature. Jugular venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen saturation remained in the normal range during hypothermia. Resting energy expenditure and cardiac output decreased progressively with hypothermia. Oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption decreased to abnormally low levels at rectal temperatures below 35 degrees C, and the correlation between them became less significant at less than 35 degrees C than that when temperatures were 350 degrees C or higher. Brain temperature was consistently higher than rectal temperature by 0.5 0.30 degrees C.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, after traumatic brain injury, decreasing body temperature to 35 to 35.5'C can reduce intracranial hypertension while maintaining sufficient cerebral perfusion pressure without cardiac dysfunction or oxygen debt. Thus, 35 to 35.5 degrees C seems to be the optimal temperature at which to treat patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

TI Syndrome simulating pseudotumor cerebri caused by partial transverse
   venous sinus obstruction in metastic prostate cancer
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB PURPOSE: To report a case of partial transverse venous sinus obstruction causing a syndrome resembling pseudotumor cerebri.
   METHOD: Case report. A 61-year-old man developed decreased vision, bilateral papilledema, and a highly increased cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed a small, extra axial mass near the torcula, which was dismissed as an incidental meningioma because cerebral angiography showed sinus patency.
   RESULTS: The patient's vision worsened, Biopsy of the enlarging mass disclosed metastatic prostate cancer. After radiation therapy, the mass shrank, magnetic resonance angiography disclosed reopening of the transverse sinuses, and papilledema resolved, but visual fields remained severely compromised.
   CONCLUSION: Partial blockage of the dural venous sinus by a small mass near the torcula can cause a sufficient increase in intracranial pressure to produce vision-threatening papilledema. (Am J Ophthalmol 2000;129:254-256, (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.).

TI Assessment of a Non-Invasive Brain Oximeter in a Sheep Model of Acute
   Brain Injury
SO MEDICAL DEVICES-EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH
AB Introduction: Evidence suggests treatments guided by brain oxygen levels improve patient outcomes following severe traumatic brain injury; however, brain oxygen levels are not routinely monitored as an effective non-invasive method has not been established. We undertook a study, in a sheep model of acute brain injury, to assess a new non-invasive brain oximeter. The monitor uses the principles of pulse oximetry to record a pulse and oxygen levels.
   Methods: We studied 8 sheep. An acute increase in intracranial pressure was induced with an injection of blood into the cranial vault. The temporal changes in the brain oximeter, intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were recorded. Simultaneous conventional skin pulse oximetry was also recorded to assess the possible influence of skin blood flow on the brain oximeter signal.
   Results: At baseline, a pulsatile waveform consistent with the brain circulation was obtained in 7 animals. The baseline brain pulse was quite distinct from the simultaneous conventional skin pulse and similar in shape to a central venous pressure waveform. Injection of blood into the cranial vault triggered an immediate increase in intracranial pressure and fall in cerebral perfusion pressure, by 60-s cerebral perfusion pressure recovered. The brain oximeter oxygen levels demonstrated similar changes with an immediate fall and recovery by 60 s. Periods of high intracranial pressure were also associated with high-frequency oscillations in the brain pulse waveform; there was, however, no change in the conventional skin pulse oximeter pulse waveform.
   Conclusion: The brain oximeter detected acute changes in both oxygen levels and the brain pulse waveform following an increase in intracranial pressure levels. The brain oximeter could assist clinicians in the management of acute brain injury.

TI Design and characterisation of a microconcentric nebuliser interface for
   capillary electrophoresis-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY
AB An interface for capillary electrophoresis (CE) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is reported. The interface was constructed using a commercial microconcentric nebuliser and home-built cyclonic spray chamber. Isoforms of the heavy metal binding protein, metallothionein, were separated and the bound metals detected to characterise the interface. Nebuliser suction was identified as the principal factor controlling separation resolution in the CE-ICP-MS system. Two methods for counterbalancing the nebuliser suction were investigated: in the first method an optimised make-up flow was employed, and in the second a negative pressure was applied to the inlet vial. Negative pressure was the preferred method for counterbalancing the nebuliser suction because sensitivity was not compromised. Separation resolution, under negative pressure conditions, was improved compared with that achieved using on-capillary UV detection. Absolute metal detection limits for Cd-114, Cd-111, Zn-66 and Zn-64 were 2.09, 3.42, 8.93 and 9.12 fg, respectively.

TI Venous sinus stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a review
   of the literature
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by headache, papilledema, visual field changes and tinnitus with elevated cerebral spinal fluid opening pressures on lumbar puncture. Left untreated, this condition can lead to permanent visual loss. Previous treatment modalities include medical management, therapeutic lumbar puncture and optic nerve sheath fenestration. They have proved to be effective but carry high rates of symptom recurrence or procedural complications. Focal dural venous sinus stenoses have been identified in many patients with IIH, leading to development of treatment through venous sinus angioplasty and stenting. A review of the literature was performed which identified patients with IIH treated with venous sinus stenting. The procedural data and outcomes are presented. A total of 143 patients with IIH (87% women, mean age 41.4years, mean body mass index 31.6kg/m(2)) treated with venous sinus stenting were included in the analysis. Symptoms at initial presentation included headache (90%), papilledema (89%), visual changes (62%) and pulsatile tinnitus (48%). There was a technical success rate of 99% for the stent placement procedure with a total of nine complications (6%). At follow-up (mean 22.3months), 88% of patients experienced improvement in headache, 97% demonstrated improvement or resolution of papilledema, 87% experienced improvement or resolution of visual symptoms and 93% had resolution of pulsatile tinnitus. In patients with IIH with focal venous sinus stenosis, endovascular stent placement across the stenotic sinus region represents an effective treatment strategy with a high technical success rate and decreased rate of complications compared with treatment modalities currently used.

TI Systemic haemodynamics and regional tissue oxygen saturation after
   bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt: positive pressure ventilation versus
   spontaneous breathing
SO INTERACTIVE CARDIOVASCULAR AND THORACIC SURGERY
AB OBJECTIVES: Spontaneous breathing has been shown to improve global haemodynamics in patients with bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt. What has not been evaluated, however, is the effect of spontaneous breathing on the distribution of cardiac output after bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt. We investigated the effects of extubation on systemic haemodynamics and regional tissue oxygen saturation, and determined whether redistribution of cardiac output is present after extubation in these patients.
   METHODS: In 24 patients undergoing bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, standard haemodynamic variables including heart rate, arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure were monitored continuously. Near-infrared spectroscopy of the brain and mesenteric circulation was monitored and recorded every hour. Cardiac index, derived from ascending aorta flow, was measured by ultrasound at three time points: 30 min before, 30 min after and 12 h after extubation.
   RESULTS: The central venous pressure decreased significantly from 19.50 +/- 3.65 mmHg before extubation to 16.17 +/- 3.41 mmHg 30 min after extubation (P = 0.006) and 13.96 +/- 2.49 mmHg 12 h after extubation (P = 0.001). Cardiac index increased significantly from 3.32 +/- 0.43 l/min/m(2) before extubation to 3.73 +/- 0.51 l/min/m(2) 30 min after extubation (P = 0.012) and 3.98 +/- 0.54 l/min/m(2) 12 h after extubation (P = 0.001). Cerebral oxygen saturation increased from 50.83 +/- 5.84% before extubation to 56.79 +/- 8.64% 30 min after extubation (P = 0.023), then remained unchanged for the following 12 h. Mesenteric oxygen saturation remained unchanged during the early period of extubation, but increased significantly 12 h after extubation (P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: The lower values of cerebral oxygen saturation before extubation indicated that the cerebral blood flow was less satisfactory. During the early period of extubation, despite the increase in cardiac index, the mesenteric oxygen saturation is lower than that at 12 h after extubation, suggesting that the obligatory increase in respiratory muscle perfusion and the increase in cerebral oxygen saturation have utilized most of the flow from the increased cardiac index. The increase in mesenteric oxygen saturation 12 h after extubation suggests a gradual improvement in microcirculation and macrocirculation.

TI Predictors for venous sinus stent retreatment in patients with
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Venous sinus stenting for dural sinus stenoses is an emerging alternative to cerebrospinal fluid diversion in cases of medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Juxta-stent 're-stenoses' have been reported and managed alternatively with ventricular shunting or stent revision. Identification of factors that might predispose patients to recurrent narrowing may help to select or exclude patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension for venous sinus stenting. Methods We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained database spanning December 2011 to May 2015 of all patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension who were screened for possible venous sinus stenting, including only patients who received a stent, noting symptomatic improvements, changes in opening lumbar puncture pressure, demographic characteristics, and any subsequent intervention after stent placement. Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were used to test each of seven potential predictors for retreatment. Results There were eight revisions in 31 patients (25.8%). Among Caucasians, 8.0% required a revision compared with 100% of African-Americans (p<0.001). The c-index for race was 0.857. Body mass index (BMI) was also a significant predictor of revision (p=0.031): among class III obese patients the revision rate was 46.2% compared with 16.7% among class I and II obese patients and 0% among overweight to normal weight patients. Conclusions BMI was a significant predictor of revision, suggesting that higher BMI may have a higher risk of revision. The small number of African-Americans in the study makes interpretation of the practical significance of the revision rate in these patients uncertain. None of the other studied factors was statistically significant.

TI Influence of head-over-body and body-over-head posture on craniospinal,
   vascular, and abdominal pressures in an acute ovine in-vivo model
SO FLUIDS AND BARRIERS OF THE CNS
AB IntroductionOptimal shunt-based hydrocephalus treatments are heavily influenced by dynamic pressure behaviors between proximal and distal ends of shunt catheters. Posture-dependent craniospinal, arterial, venous, and abdominal dynamics thereby play an essential role.MethodsAn in-vivo ovine trial (n = 6) was conducted to evaluate communication between craniospinal, arterial, venous, and abdominal dynamics. Tilt-testing was performed between -13 & DEG; and + 13 & DEG; at 10-min intervals starting and ending at 0 & DEG; prone position. Mean pressure, pulse pressure, and Pearson correlation (r) to the respective angle were calculated. Correlations are defined as strong: |r|& GE; 0.7, mild: 0.3 r|< 0.7, and weak: |r|& LE; 0.3. Transfer functions (TFs) between the arterial and adjacent compartments were derived.ResultsStrong correlations were observed between posture and: mean carotid/femoral arterial (r = - 0.97, r = - 0.87), intracranial, intrathecal (r = - 0.98, r = 0.94), jugular (r = - 0.95), abdominal cranial, dorsal, caudal, and intravesical pressure (r = - 0.83, r = 0.84, r = - 0.73, r = 0.99) while mildly positive correlation exists between tilt and central venous pressure (r = 0.65). Only dorsal abdominal pulse pressure yielded a significant correlation to tilt (r = 0.21). TFs followed general lowpass behaviors with resonant peaks at 4.2 & PLUSMN; 0.4 and 11.5 & PLUSMN; 1.5 Hz followed by a mean roll-off of - 15.9 & PLUSMN; 6.0 dB/decade.ConclusionsTilt-tests with multi-compartmental recordings help elucidate craniospinal, arterial, venous, and abdominal dynamics, which is essential to optimize shunt-based therapy. Results motivate hydrostatic influences on mean pressure, with all pressures correlating to posture, with little influence on pulse pressure. TF results quantify the craniospinal, arterial, venous, and abdominal compartments as compliant systems and help pave the road for better quantitative models of the interaction between the craniospinal and adjacent spaces.

SO NERVENHEILKUNDE
AB Pseudotumor cerebri is an intracranial increase of CSF pressure which can occur either as an idiopathic or as a symptomatic type. The diagnosis is made according to the criteria of the International Headache Society. The pathogenesis of the idiopathic type is poorly understood. Risk factors are female sex and obesity. Symptomatic types can be caused by intoxications or different types of hydrocephalus. The treatment of symptomatic types is primarily the treatment of the underlying disorder. Furthermore, weight reduction and drug treatment with acetazolamide, topiramate, or furosemide are helpful. Surgical procedures are possible but should be used only if all other possibilities have not been successful.

TI Direct transcranial coil and Onyx embolization of a dural arteriovenous
   fistula: Technical note and brief literature review
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Intracranial high-grade dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) have higher bleeding rates compared to other intracranial vascular malformations. Endovascular treatment is usually recommended for high-grade lesions, aiming at a complete fistula obliteration. However, some patients have vascular abnormalities that limit endovascular access to the precise location of the shunt. Alternative techniques may be considered in this scenario. A middle-aged man presented with intracranial hypertension secondary to a high-grade DAVF. Because of vascular abnormalities precluding transvenous access to the intracranial venous circulation, the patient required treatment by a direct transcranial coil and Onyx embolization of the shunt. Direct transcranial cannulation of a dural sinus is an alternative and effective route for transvenous embolization of DAVFs, especially if abnormal venous anatomy precluding venous access to the required cranial venous system is identified.

De laet This article focuses primarily on the recent literature on abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) and the definitions and recommendations published by the World Society for the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. The definitions regarding increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) are listed and are followed by an overview of the different mechanisms of organ dysfunction associated with intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). Measurement techniques for IAP are discussed, as are recommendations for organ function support and options for treatment in patients who have IAH. ACS was first described in surgical patients who had abdominal trauma, bleeding, or infection; but recently, ACS has been described in patients who have other pathologies. This article intends to provide critical care physicians with a clear insight into the current state of knowledge regarding IAH and ACS.

TI Headache and Diplopia after Rapid Maxillary Expansion: A Clue to
   Underdiagnosed Pseudotumor Cerebri Syndrome?
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY
AB Rapid maxillary expansion (RME) is an orthodontic procedure that separates the two maxillary bones at the mid palatine suture level. RME is commonly used in the pediatric age group to reduce and/or eliminate a transverse maxillary deficiency. At our institution we followed up an 11-year-old adolescent who was diagnosed with a class III malocclusion and was treated by RME with the combined use of expansion appliances (i.e., Hyrax) in addition to maxillary protraction devices (i.e., Delaire facemask). Three months after the start of treatment, he complained of headache and double vision, and was admitted to our hospital. A funduscopic examination revealed papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed intraocular protrusion of the optic nerve head and enlarged perioptic subarachnoid space. Cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure during lumbar puncture was elevated (+370 mm H2O), confirming the diagnosis of the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS). Removal of the maxillary expander and facemask led to the complete resolution of clinical symptoms in 1 week. The association of RME and PTCSrelated manifestations was first reported by Timms in 1986, but, to the best of our knowledge, further cases have been not described in the medical literature. This overlooks PTCS as a potential RME-associated complication. We suggest that clinicians should carefully consider PTCS in all pediatric patients that complain of headache and/or visual disturbances during a treatment by RME. We also speculate on the possible changes of the cerebral venous circulation during RME, potentially leading to an impaired venous drainage that may cause increased intracranial pressure and PTCS.

TI Continuous postoperative ICBF monitoring in aneurysmal SAH patients
   using a combined ICP-laser Doppler fiberoptic probe
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Cerebral vasospasm remains the principal cause of morbidity and mortality following successful clipping of intracranial aneurysms. Current management often requires subjective judgments concerning presumed abnormalities of cerebral blood flow. In this study, a combined intracranial pressure (ICP)-laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) fiberoptic probe that permits continuous monitoring of local cerebral blood flow (1CBF) was used in the postoperative management of 20 aneurysm patients. Using this probe, 1CBF was simultaneously recorded and integrated on a real time basis with other physiological parameters, including ICP, systemic arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and pulse oximetry. The combined probe also provided the ability to obtain precise and detailed information concerning the presence or absence of cerebral autoregulation and CO2 vascular reactivity, and allowed calculation of the cerebral vascular resistance. Continuous monitoring of 1CBF in this manner complemented by transcranial Doppler and angiographic data permitted early detection of cerebral ischemia, helped to differentiate cerebral ischemia from edema and hyperemia, was useful in titrating blood pressure and fluid management, provided direct feedback about the effectiveness of instituted therapies, and determined early on when medical management was of no avail and that interventional neuroradiology was indicated, Evidence is presented that the presence of angiographic vasospasm and increased velocities on TCD do not always correlate with ischemia in the microcirculation and that direct measurements of 1CBF are often at variance with calculations of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).

TI Anomalous venous collaterals in Apert and Crouzon syndromes and their
   relationship to ventricle size and increased intracranial pressure
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB OBJECTIVE The exact association between the frequently present anomalous intracranial venous vasculature, emissary collaterals, ventriculomegaly, and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in children with Apert and Crouzon syndromes remains an enigma. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the aberrant venous system and ventricle size and increased ICP, and to assess the development of the venous structures over time. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included all patients with Apert or Crouzon syndrome with available CT venography (CTV) scans of the brain. Anomalous venous vasculature was assessed by the total collateral score (TCS), which scored 9 intra- and extracranial venous structures (TCS range 0-16). Ventricle size (fronto-occipital horn ratio [FOHR]) was measured on the same scan. The presence of increased ICP, a shunt, tonsillar herniation, and head circumference were extracted from electronic patient records and were used as secondary covariates. Subsequent CTV scans were scored when available. RESULTS Ninety patients were included in this study. The mean TCS was 7.5 +/- 2.5, and was comparable for patients with Apert and Crouzon syndromes (mean 8.0 and 7.3, respectively). The presence of an extra abnormal venous structure was associated with an increase of the FOHR of 3.2% (p < 0.01). After dividing the venous structures into intra- and extracranial, a similar association between both and the FOHR was found (4.1% and 2.3%, respectively; p < 0.01). The TCS was similar for patients with normal and increased ICP at the time of the scan. Sixteen patients had dual CTV scans. The median time between both scans was 3.2 years. The presence of collaterals remained stable over time (median Delta TCS = 0.3). Seven patients with functioning shunts also maintained high TCSs (median TCS = 9). CONCLUSIONS In patients with Apert and Crouzon syndromes, a close relationship between venous collaterals and ventricle size was observed, in which a more extensive aberrant venous drainage pattern, both intra- and extracranial, was associated with larger ventricles. Preliminary longitudinal data suggested that the presence of venous collaterals remained constant over time despite effective treatment of increased ICP, indicating reliance on these collaterals even in cases of normal ICP. The authors hypothesize that this dependence on collateral drainage is the result of their aberrant internal venous anatomy and predisposes individuals to increased ICP.

AB Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has revolutionised wound care. Yet, it is still not understood how hypobaric tissue pressure accelerates wound healing. There is very little reported on the relevant physics of any substance subjected to suction in this manner. The common assumption is that applying suction to a substance is likely to result in a reduction of pressure in that substance. Although more than 250 research articles have been published on NPWT, there are little data verifying whether suction increases or decreases the pressure of the substance it is applied to. Clarifying this basic question of physics is the first step in understanding the mechanism of action of these dressings.
   In this study, pressure changes were recorded in soft plasticene and processed meat, using an intracranial tissue pressure microsensor. Circumferential, non-circumferential and cavity NPWT dressings were applied, and pressure changes within the underlying substance were recorded at different suction pressures. Pressures were also measured at 1 cm, 2 cm and 3 cm from the NPWT placed in a cavity.
   In all three types of NPWT dressings, the underlying substance pressure was increased (hyperbaric) as suction pressure increased. Although there was a substantial pressure increase at 1 cm, the rise in pressure at the 2-cm and 3-cm intervals was minimal.
   Substance pressure beneath all types of NPWT dressing is hyperbaric in inanimate substances. Higher suction pressures generate greater substance pressures; however, the increased pressure rapidly dissipates as the distance from the dressing is increased. The findings of this study on inanimate objects suggest that we may need to review our current perception of the physics underlying NPWT dressings. Further research of this type on living tissues is warranted. (C) 2009 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Venous sinus stenting versus ventriculoperitoneal shunting: comparing
   clinical outcomes for idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Venous sinus stenting (VSS) has been shown to reduce intracranial venous pressures and improve symptoms in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). However, long-term follow-up data are limited, raising concerns about sustained symptom improvement. We aimed to assess long-term outcomes of VSS compared with ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS).
   Methods A retrospective case-control study assessed 87 patients with IIH who met inclusion criteria and underwent either VSS (n=27) or VPS (n=60) between 2017 and 2022. Descriptive statistics for baseline characteristics and outcomes were calculated, followed by multivariate logistic regression to identify factors associated with headache recurrence.
   Results Baseline characteristics were similar between VSS and VPS groups, including age (p=0.58), sex (p=0.74), body mass index (p=0.47), and preoperative lumbar puncture opening pressure (p=0.62). Preoperative symptoms of headaches (p=0.42), papilledema (p=0.35), and pulsatile tinnitus (p=0.56) were also similar. Initial headache improvement was comparable (96% vs 91%, p=0.42). However, headache recurrence was less common in the VSS group (31% vs 60%, p=0.015) at the last follow-up, averaging over 1 year. Multivariate analysis showed VSS was independently associated with reduced odds of headache recurrence (OR 0.24, p=0.015). Longer follow-up was associated with increased odds of headache recurrence in both groups (OR 1.01, p=0.032).
   Conclusion VSS was independently associated with reduced odds of headache recurrence compared with VPS in multivariate analysis. Longer follow-up was significantly associated with headache recurrence in both groups. This suggests that VSS may lead to better outcomes for continued headache relief, but headache recurrence may increase with longer follow-up regardless of treatment modality.

TI Anatomical Variations of the Transverse-Sigmoid Sinus Junction:
   Implications for Endovascular Treatment of Idiopathic Intracranial
   Hypertension
SO ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY
   BIOLOGY
AB Venous sinus pathology can result in multiple pathological diseases, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). There remains a paucity of information on anatomical luminal variations of the major venous sinuses which may contribute to the etiology of certain disease states. Thirty-six transverse and sigmoid sinuses were removed following dissection of 19 unfixed cadaveric heads. Sinuses were opened longitudinally to study luminal variations. A semiquantitative classification system was developed to assess septations and blind pouches. Seventy-nine percent of cadavers had a luminal anatomical variation. Forty-four percent and 42% of sinuses dissected had occurrence of a septations or blind pouches, respectively. Thirty percent of septations and 25% of pouches were classified as large. Incidence of anatomical variations was not statistically significant between cadaver gender or sinus laterality. Luminal variations are present in the transverse and sigmoid sinuses at rates higher than expected. This study is the first to report the presence of blind pouches in the luminal wall of transverse and sigmoid sinuses. These variations can have clinical importance to the endovascular surgeon and may also contribute to the pathophysiological etiology of venous sinus diseases. Anat Rec, 299: 1037-1042, 2016.

TI Progressive versus Nonprogressive Intracranial Dural Arteriovenous
   Fistulas: Characteristics and Outcomes
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A minority of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas progress with time. We sought to determine features that predict progression and define outcomes of patients with progressive dural arteriovenous fistulas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective imaging and clinical record review of patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula evaluated at our hospital.
   RESULTS: Of 579 patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas, 545 had 1 fistula (mean age, 45 +/- 23 years) and 34 (5.9%) had enlarging, de novo, multiple, or recurrent fistulas (mean age, 53 +/- 20 years; P = .11). Among these 34 patients, 19 had progressive dural arteriovenous fistulas with de novo fistulas or fistula enlargement with time (mean age, 36 +/- 25 years; progressive group) and 15 had multiple or recurrent but nonprogressive fistulas (mean age, 57 +/- 13 years; P = .0059, nonprogressive group). Whereas all 6 children had fistula progression, only 13/28 adults (P = .020) progressed. Angioarchitectural correlates to chronically elevated intracranial venous pressures, including venous sinus dilation (41% versus 7%, P = .045) and pseudophlebitic cortical venous pattern (P = .048), were more common in patients with progressive disease than in those without progression. Patients with progressive disease received more treatments than those without progression (median, 5 versus 3; P = .0068), but as a group, they did not demonstrate worse clinical outcomes (median mRS,1 and 1; P = .39). However, 3 young patients died from intracranial venous hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage related to progression of their fistulas despite extensive endovascular, surgical, and radiosurgical treatments.
   CONCLUSIONS: Few patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas follow an aggressive, progressive clinical course despite treatment. Younger age at initial presentation and angioarchitectural correlates to venous hypertension may help identify these patients prospectively.

TI HEMODYNAMICS OF DIFFERENT DEGREES OF RIGHT HEART BYPASS - EXPERIMENTAL
   ASSESSMENT
SO ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
AB Background. Although their assessment could be of the utmost importance to determine the surgical treatment for patients with univentricular hearts, differences in ventricular performance between partial and complete right heart bypass remain to be defined.
   Methods. Three different degrees of right heart bypass were investigated in 5 mongrel dogs: (1) superior vena cava to both pulmonary arteries shunt (SCP); (2) inferior vena cava to both pulmonary arteries shunt (ICP); and (3) both venae cavae to both pulmonary arteries shunt (BCP). Hemodynamic studies included evaluation of the cardiac index and left atrial pressure as a function of the degree of right heart bypass.
   Results. By maintaining the mean left atrial pressure at 5 mm Hg, cardiac indexes were 1.98 +/- 0.25, 1.67 +/- 0.29, and 1.33 +/- 0.21 L . min(-1) m(-2) for SCP, ICP, and BCP shunts, respectively (p = 0.001). When keeping the cardiac index constant, mean left atrial pressures were 5.2 +/- 0.8, 5.5 +/- 0.9, and 7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg for SCP, ICP, and BCP shunts, respectively (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions. Increasing degrees of right heart bypass are associated with a significant decrease in ventricular performance in this experimental model.

TI Venous Causes of Pulsatile Tinnitus: Clinical Presentation, Clinical and
   Radiographic Evaluation, Pathogenesis, and Endovascular Treatments: A
   Literature Review
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB Tinnitus is an abnormal perception of a sound without external stimulation. Venous pulsatile tinnitus (VPT) is a specific form of tinnitus characterized by an objective and often subjective bruit that occurs as a result of localized venous abnormalities. Clinical evaluation relies on sound quality, duration, and precipitating factors. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) are among the most common causes of VPT. Other causes include sigmoid sinus wall abnormalities (SSWAs), jugular vein anomalies (JVAs), and emissary veins anomalies. These anomalies can be detected on magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography/magnetic resonance venography, and high-resolution temporal bone computed tomography. The pathogenesis behind the VPT includes turbulent blood flow as a result of lumina) stenosis or abnormal dilation, amplification of internal sound due to temporal bone defects, and abnormal position of the venous sinus system structures adjacent to the bony structures of the auditive apparatus. Based on these theories, different interventional treatment modalities can be applied to treat the underlying causes. Endovascular treatments have shown high efficacy and safety among those treatments which include stenting of the lateral sinus stenosis in IIH and TSS, coiling of the SSWA and JVA, and embolization of emissary veins anomalies. Further studies are needed to understand the natural history of these anomalies and the efficacy of treatments of VPT, which-unlike other types of tinnitus-can be cured with proper treatment.

TI ISOFLURANE, HALOTHANE, AND REGIONAL CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW AT VARIOUS
   LEVELS OF PACO2 IN RABBITS
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB The effects of halothane and isoflurane on regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) were studied in 18 New Zealand White rabbits anesthetized with nitrous oxide (N2O) and morphine sulfate (MS) at there different levels of PaCO2. CBF was measured using the hydrogen clearance technique. Monitored variables were intracranial pressure (ICP), central venous pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, electroencephalogram, arterial blood gases, end-tidal (ET) volatile anesthetic, and ET CO2. addition of 1 MAC halothane to the N2O/MS background anesthetic caused flow to increase significantly in all three regions studied (cortex, dorsal hippocampus, white matter) at all three levels of PaCO2 (low 20-25 mmHg; normal: 35-40 mmHg; high: 50-55 mmHg). Addition of 1 MAC isoflurane to the background anesthetic caused CBF to decrease significantly in all regions during hypocapnia. During normocapnia, CBF was unchanged with the addition of 1 MAC isoflurane in all regions and during  hypercapnia, CBF increased significantly only in the dorsal hippocampus following addition of 1 MAC isoflurane to the MS/N2O background anesthetic. Volatile anesthetic administration was associated with significant, although small, increases in ICP at all PaCO2 levels. We conclude that 1 MAC concentrations of halothane and isoflurane have opposite effects on CBF when added to a N2O/MS anesthetic during hypocapnia and that the effects of isoflurane on regional CBF are dependent on PaCO2 in rabbits under the anesthetic conditons of this experiment.

TI Laparoscopic Resection of Endometriosis in a Patient with a
   Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Using the LapDisc
SO JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
AB The surgical approach in a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in need of abdominal surgery remains controversial. The risk of increased intracranial pressure with pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopy is still unresolved. We used the LapDisc (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, New Jersey) to access the shunt and temporarily seal it, which enabled us to perform laparoscopic resection of endometriosis without subjecting the shunt to high intraabdominal pressure. The benefits of this approach are the ability to perform laparoscopy, less skin-to-shunt contact minimizing infection, and elimination of possible increased intracranial pressure secondary to pneumoperitoneum.
   With the progress made in the management of hydrocephalus, patients with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts enjoy a longer lifespan. Therefore, the gynecologic laparoscopic surgeon can expect to treat a patient with a VP shunt in place. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2010) 17, 107-109 (C) 2010 AAGL. All rights reserved.

Here, we studied the feasibility and curative effect of the treatment of IJVS by stent placement. A total of 3 patients with IJVS were diagnosed by angiography and treated with stent placement. Anticoagulant therapy was conducted after surgery. The clinical presentations, endovascular procedures, as well as clinical results of the 3 patients were reviewed. The clinical symptoms of the 3 patients with IJVS improved after stent placement. Blood flowed fluently in the vein stent without thrombosis and the short-term curative effects were satisfactory. In conclusions, venous stent placement may be a good option for the treatment of IJVS.

TI A severe vicious cycle in uncontrolled subarachnoid hemorrhage: the
   effects on cerebral blood flow and hemodynamic responses upon
   intracranial hypertension
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY
AB In subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), Cushing postulated that the increase in systemic arterial pressure (SAP) in response to elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) was beneficial to cerebral perfusion. However, in uncontrolled SAH, the increased SAP may cause more bleeding into the subarachnoid space and further increase the ICP. We created an animal model to simulate SAH by connecting a femoral arterial catheter to the subarachnoid space. The global cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with a venous outflow method. The purposes were to observe the CBF change under the simulated SAH, and to evaluate the effects of an adrenergic blocker and a vasodilator. In addition, spectral analysis of the aortic pressure and flow was employed for the analysis of hemodynamic changes at various ICP levels. When the femoral arterial blood was allowed to flow into the subarachnoid space, the ICP was elevated. The Cushing response to increased ICP caused an increase in SAP. A vicious cycle was generated between ICP and SAP. The CBF under the vicious cycle was greatly depressed. The dog developed pulmonary edema (PE) within 5 mins. An alpha-adrenergic blocker (phentolamine) and a vasodilator (nitroprusside) were beneficial to the reduction of SAP and ICP, improvement of CBF, and prevention of PE. Hemodynamic analysis revealed that graded increases in ICP caused increases in SAP, total peripheral resistance, arterial impedance, and pulse reflection with decreases in stroke volume, cardiac output and arterial compliance. The hemodynamic changes may contribute to acute left ventricular failure that leads to pressure and volume loading in the lung circulation, and finally acute PE.

TI A survey on the effect of adding aspirin to anti-migraine drugs on the
   severity of headache in patients with chronic migraine headaches with
   lateral venous sinus stenosis in MRV
SO JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE
AB Introduction:One of the probable etiologies raised in patients with chronic migraine headaches is stenosis of the lateral venous sinuses of the brain, which is detectable using magnetic resonance venography (MRV). In this study, we decided to observe the effect of adding aspirin to anti-migraine medicines on the severity of headache in patients with chronic migraine headaches with lateral venous sinus stenosis in MRV.Methods:The study was a double-blind randomized clinical trial. Patients were included in the study in two groups including 30 people. The first group was treated with propranolol and nortriptyline, and the second group was treated with propranolol, nortriptyline, and aspirin. The severity of headache, number of headaches during one month, and duration of a headache before treatment and one, two, and three months after treatment were examined. Data were analyzed utilizing SPSS software version 19 and statistical tests like t-test, Chi-squared test, Paired t-test, and repeated measure.Results:The results showed that the mean severity of headache in the second group was significantly lower than the first group two months after treatment (P = 0.003) and three months after treatment (P = 0.002). Additionally, the number of headaches (P = 0.001) and duration of headache (P = 0.043) were significantly lower in the second group than the first group in the first three months after treatment. No statistically significant difference was observed between the frequency distribution of nausea/vomiting in the two groups.Conclusion:The addition of aspirin to anti-migraine medicines is effective in improving the severity of headache in patients with migraine with lateral venous sinus stenosis of the brain.

TI MONITORING OF INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE AFTER OPEN-HEART SURGERY
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
AB Brain damage following open-heart surgery is receiving increasing attention. Efforts are being made to improve the setting for cardiac surgery so as to avoid such complications. When they occur, their recognition is retrospective, when the cerebral lesion is inevitable. Because heavy sedation is necessary, clinical supervision with respect to brain function is both difficult and unreliable in the early postoperative period. Selected patients (34) were submitted to neurosurgical intensive care supervision. The measures included postoperative monitoriong of intracranial epidural pressure (EDP), of arterial blood pressure (BP) and of central venous pressure (CVP). In 25 patients there was rise in EDP during the 1st postoperative hours. Six of these patients received mannitol treatment and in 3 of them barbiturate was additionally given to reduce EDP and improve the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = BP - EDP). Nevertheless, EDP progressed to brain tamponade 6 days postoperatively in 1 case. In patients with raised EDP, weaning from the ventilator should be postponed until EDP has almost normalized. The EDP recording is a valuable guide in the postoperative management of the individual patient.

TI The neurological complications of achondroplasia
SO BRAIN & DEVELOPMENT
AB The genetics of achondroplasia are discussed, and then the clinical features. The respiratory complications are only considered when related to the neurological ones which are the concern of this paper; and their effects on morbidity and mortality. Cervicomedullary compression can cause pain, ataxia, incontinence, apnea, and respiratory arrest. One of the signs can be progressive quadriparesis which can be a presenting symptom; and may be caused by a vascular lesion as well as by cord compression. Also nerve root compression in the neural foramina can cause symptoms and signs in the limbs. Enlargement of the head is a feature of achondroplasia. This may be due to subdural haematoma related to the wide subarachnoid spaces, and to trauma. Hydrocephalus is common, and may be non-communicating and due to aqueduct stenosis, but is much more often communicating and the result of raised intracranial venous pressure. Shunting may be necessary, but surgery directed towards relieving the venous pressure may be more logical. Otitis media often affects these children, and can cause deafness and subsequently delayed language development. Sleep disturbances can be the result of both neurological and respiratory complications. Apart from the treatment for hydrocephalus the most important decision is often the question of operating on the cervical medullary compression. Risk factors such as brisk reflexes, small foramen magnum, and central hypopnea, can be an indication for surgery; but timing can be difficult as the cord compression can resolve spontaneously. The intelligence levels of these children are usually normal, and studies have shown a surprisingly high level of satisfaction with the services provided. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Hyperacute measurement of intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion
   pressure, jugular venous oxygen saturation, and laser Doppler flowmetry,
   before and during removal of traumatic acute subdural hematoma
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Object. The poor prognosis for traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) might be due to underlying primary brain damage, ischemia, or both. Ischemia in ASDH is likely caused by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), but the degree to which these phenomena occur is unknown. The authors report data obtained before and during removal of ASDH in five cases.
   Methods. Five patients who underwent emergency evacuation of ASDH were monitored. In all patients, without delaying treatment, a separate surgical team (including the senior author) placed an ICP monitor and a jugular bulb catheter, and in two patients a laser Doppler probe was placed.
   The ICP prior to removing the bone flap in the five patients was 85, 85, 50, 59, and greater than 40 mm Hg, resulting in CPPs of 25, 3, 25, 56, and less than 50 mm Hg, respectively. Removing the bone flap as well as opening the dura and removing the blood clot produced a significant decrease in ICP and an increase in CPP. Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO(2)) increased in four patients and decreased in the other during removal of the hematoma. Laser Doppler flow also increased, to 217% and 211% compared with preevacuation flow.
   Conclusions. Intracranial pressure is higher than previously suspected and CPP is very low in patients with ASDH. Removal of the bone flap yielded a significant reduction in ICR which was further decreased by opening the dura and evacuating the hematoma. The SjvO(2) as well as laser Doppler flow increased in all patients but one immediately after removal of the hematoma.

TI Safe Inspiratory Pressures Threshold in Lung Recruitment Maneuvers: An
   In Vivo Neonatal ARDS Model
SO RESPIRATORY CARE
AB BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to define the level of peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and mean airway pressure ((P) over bar (aw)) at which a pneumothorax is produced in an in vivo ARDS neonate model. In addition, we analyzed the hemodynamic response and cerebral parameters during the progressive increase of intrathoracic pressure. METHODS: We designed a prospective, experimental study with 11 Landrace x Large White pigs < 48 h from their birth. With the pigs under general anesthesia, tracheal intubation, invasive hemodynamic monitoring with a pediatric arterial thermodilution catheter, intracranial pressure, cerebral oximetry through nearinfrared spectroscopy, and bilateral chest tube catheterization were performed. The ARDS model was developed with bronchoalveolar lavages. The rise in inspiratory pressure was performed achieved by increasing PEEP in stepwise increments at a constant driving pressure. PEEP was increased 5 cm H2O every 2 min until a pneumothorax was observed. A descriptive analysis, a Kaplan-Meier curve, and a regression analysis by using a generalized estimation equation were performed. RESULTS: A pneumothorax was observed in a median (interquartile range [IQR]) <(P)over bar>(aw)cof 54 (46-56) cm H2O and median (IQR) PIP of 65 (58-73) cm H2O; asystole at median (IQR) (P) over bar (aw) of 49 (36-54) cm H2O and median (IQR) PIP of 60 (48-65) cm H2O. Hemodynamic changes in the median artery pressure, cardiac output, and myocardial contractility were observed above the range of (P) over bar (aw) of 14 cm H2O (PIP 25 and PEEP 10 cm H2O). Disturbances in intracranial pressure and cerebral oximetry through near-infrared spectroscopy appeared when deep hypotension and asystole occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A progressive increase of PEEP at a constant driving pressure did not increase severe adverse events at the range of pressures that we routinely use in neonates with ARDS. Asystole, pneumothorax, and cerebral compromise appeared at high intrathoracic ranges of pressure. Hemodynamics must be strictly monitored in all patients during the performance of lung recruitment maneuvers because hemodynamic deflections emerge early, at a range of pressures commonly used in ventilated neonates with ARDS.

TI Regional cerebral blood flow after acetazolamide challenge in patients
   with dural arteriovenous fistula: Simple way to evaluate intracranial
   venous hypertension
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because venous hypertension determines the clinical severity of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs), evaluation of intracranial venous pressure is important in making decisions concerning treatment. We determined whether intracranial venous hypertension could be quantified by using an acetazolamide test in a manner that indicates whether treatment of the DAVF is necessary.
   METHODS: We enrolled 21 untreated patients: 11 with a sigmoid and/or transverse DAVF, six with a cavernous DAVF, two with an anterior cranial fossa DAVIT, and two with a superior sagittal sinus DAVF. Cerebral hemodynamics were studied with stable-xenon CT. Patients were angiographically classified into three groups, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after acetazolamide challenge was compared between angiographic groups, between patients with and those without symptoms attributable to intracranial venous hypertension, and between preembolization and postembolization examinations.
   RESULTS: A high angiographic grade was associated with decreased resting rCBF and a blunted response to acetazolamide. Response to acetazolamide was more sensitive to venous hypertension, as angiographically assessed, than decreased resting rCBF. Resting rCBF and the increase in rCBF associated with acetazolamide were significantly lower in the symptomatic group than in the asymptomatic group. Treatment of the DAVIT significantly enhanced the increased rCBF due to the acetazolamide challenge.
   CONCLUSION. Cerebral venous hypertension in DAVF reduced the response to acetazolamide, as shown on stable-Xe CT. Therefore, a patient with DAVF and a reduced rCBF response to acetazolamide requires treatment irrespective of his or her symptoms.

TI Laparoscopic surgery in children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts:
   Effect of pneumoperitoneum on intracranial pressure - Preliminary
   experience
SO UROLOGY
AB Objectives. We monitored changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) in 2 children with myelodysplasia undergoing laparoscopic bladder autoaugmentation. Both children had ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS) secondary to Arnold-Chiari malformations (type II).
   Methods. ICP was monitored through a 23-gauge needle placed into the shunt reservoir and connected to a pressure transducer and drainage system. Intraoperative mean arterial pressure, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), ICP, abdominal pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressures were all monitored.
   Results. Both children demonstrated rapid onset and sustained increases in ICP of greater than 12 mm Hg above baseline to a maximum pressure of 25 mm Hg. The average cerebrospinal fluid removed from each patient was 30 cc, thereby lowering ICP with no adverse neurologic sequela. The pCO(2) remained constant throughout the procedures, as measured by ETCO2.
   Conclusions. We believe that intracranial hypertension (IH) results from a ''Valsalva-like'' phenomenon, which causes cerebral vascular engorgement. in addition, the pneumoperitoneum may increase the resistance to outflow through the distal peritoneal catheter, causing a partial or complete shunt obstruction. Untreated IH may result in adverse neurologic sequelae from brain herniation in these children with hindbrain anomalies and potentially altered brain compliance. We believe it is prudent to perform intraoperative ICP monitoring in this subgroup of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery and that IH should be treated by ventricular drainage.

TI HOSPITAL-BASED ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC MONITORING: THE GOOD, THE NOT SO
   GOOD, AND UNTAPPED POTENTIAL
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was first introduced into hospitals in the 1960s, initially into critical care, as bedside monitors, and eventually into step-down units with telemetry capabilities. Although the initial use was rather simplistic (ie, heart rate and rhythm assessment), the capabilities of these devices and associated physiologic (vital sign) monitors have expanded considerably. Current bedside monitors now include sophisticated ECG software designed to identify myocardial ischemia (ie, ST-segment monitoring), QT-interval prolongation, and a myriad of other cardiac arrhythmia types. Physiologic monitoring has had similar advances from noninvasive assessment of core vital signs (blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) to invasive monitoring including arterial blood pressure, temperature, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, carbon dioxide, and many others. The benefit of these monitoring devices is that continuous and real-time information is displayed and can be configured to alarm to alert nurses to a change in a patient's condition. I think it is fair to say that critical and high-acuity care nurses see these devices as having a positive impact in patient care. However, this enthusiasm has been somewhat dampened in the past decade by research highlighting the shortcomings and unanticipated consequences of these devices, namely alarm and alert fatigue. In this article, which is associated with the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses' Distinguished Research Lecture, I describe my 36-year journey from a clinical nurse to nurse scientist and the trajectory of my program of research focused primarily on ECG and physiologic monitoring. Specifically, I discuss the good, the not so good, and the untapped potential of these monitoring systems in clinical care. I also describe my experiences with community-based research in patients with acute coronary syndrome and/or heart failure.

TI Non-invasive estimation of intracranial pressure. MR-based evaluation in
   children with hydrocephalus
SO RADIOLOGE
AB The intracranial pressure (ICP) is a crucially important parameter for diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making in patients with hydrocephalus.
   So far there is no standard method to non-invasively assess the ICP. Various approaches to obtain the ICP semi-invasively or non-invasively are discussed and the clinical application of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method to estimate ICP (MR-ICP) is demonstrated in a group of pediatric patients with hydrocephalus.
   Arterial inflow, venous drainage and craniospinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow were quantified using phase-contrast imaging to derive the MR-ICP.
   A total of 15 patients with hydrocephalus (n=9 treated with shunt placement or ventriculostomy) underwent MRI on a 3 T scanner applying retrospectively-gated cine phase contrast sequences. Of the patients six had clinical symptoms indicating increased ICP (age 2.5-14.61 years, mean 7.4 years) and nine patients had no clinical signs of elevated ICP (age 2.1-15.9 years; mean 9.8 years; all treated with shunt or ventriculostomy). Median MR-ICP in symptomatic patients was 24.5 mmHg (25th percentile 20.4 mmHg; 75th percentile 44.6 mmHg). Median MR-ICP in patients without acute signs of increased ICP was 9.8 mmHg (25th percentile 8.6 mmHg; 75th percentile 11.4 mmHg). Group differences were significant (p < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U-test).
   The MR-ICP technique is a promising non-invasive tool for estimating ICP.
   Further studies in larger patient cohorts are warranted to investigate its application in children with hydrocephalus.

TI A proposed framework for cerebral venous congestion
SO NEURORADIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Background While venous congestion in the peripheral vasculature has been described and accepted, intracranial venous congestion remains poorly understood. The characteristics, pathophysiology, and management of cerebral venous stasis, venous hypertension and venous congestion remain controversial, and a unifying conceptual schema is absent. The cerebral venous and lymphatic systems are part of a complex and dynamic interaction between the intracranial compartments, with interplay between the parenchyma, veins, arteries, cerebrospinal fluid, and recently characterized lymphatic-like systems in the brain. Each component contributes towards intracranial pressure, occupying space within the fixed calvarial volume. This article proposes a framework to consider conditions resulting in brain and neck venous congestion, and seeks to expedite further study of cerebral venous diagnoses, mechanisms, symptomatology, and treatments.
   Methods A multi-institution retrospective review was performed to identify unique patient cases, complemented with a published case series to assess a spectrum of disease states with components of venous congestion affecting the brain. These diseases were organized according to anatomical location and purported mechanisms. Outcomes of treatments were also analyzed. Illustrative cases were identified in the venous treatment databases of the authors.
   Conclusion This framework is the first clinically structured description of venous pathologies resulting in intracranial venous and cerebrospinal fluid hypertension. Our proposed system highlights unique clinical symptoms and features critical for appropriate diagnostic work-up and potential treatment. This novel schema allows clinicians effectively to approach cases of intracranial hypertension secondary to venous etiologies, and furthermore provides a framework by which researchers can better understand this developing area of cerebrovascular disease.

TI A Decerebrate Preparation of the Rattlesnake, <i>Crotalus durissus</i>,
   Provides an Experimental Model for Study of Autonomic Modulation of the
   Cardiovascular System in Reptiles
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY
AB The South American rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus, has been successfully used as an experimental model to study control of the cardiovascular system in squamate reptiles. Recent technical advances, including equipment miniaturization, have lessened the impact of instrumentation on in vivo recordings, and an increased range of anesthetic drugs has improved recording conditions for in situ preparations. Nevertheless, any animal-based experimental approach has to manage limitations regarding the avoidance of pain and stress the stability of the preparation and duration of experiments and the potentially overriding effects of anesthesia. To address such aspects, we tested a new experimental preparation, the decerebrate rattlesnake, in a study of the autonomic control of cardiovascular responses following the removal of general anesthesia. The preparation exhibited complex cardiovascular adjustments to deal with acute increases in venous return (caused by tail lifting), to compensate for blood flow reduction in the cephalic region (caused by head lifting), for body temperature control (triggered by an external heating source), and in response to stimulation of chemoreceptors (triggered by intravenous injection of NaCN). The decerebrate preparation retained extensive functional integrity of autonomic centers, and it was suitable for monitoring diverse cardiac and vascular variables. Furthermore, reanesthetizing the preparation markedly blunted cardiovascular performance. Isoflurane limited the maintenance of recovered cardiovascular variables in the prepared animal and reduced or abolished the observed cardiovascular reflexes. This preparation enables the recording of multiple concomitant cardiovascular variables for the study of mechanistic questions regarding the central integration of autonomic reflex responses in the absence of anesthesia.

TI A resolving sign of acute subdural hematoma: from report of two cases
SO NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY
AB A Ii-year-old-boy (Case 1) and a 60-year-old-man (Case 2) presented with rare spontaneous resolution of acute subdural hematoma (ASDH). They were admitted with consciousness disturbance, drowsy in Case 1 and sleepy in Case 2. Initial CT showed ASDH associated with a low density band between the hematoma and the inner wall of the skull base, combined with right parietal contusion in Case 2. Repeat CT showed that the hematoma had resolved spontaneously after a few hours, and the patients regained clear consciousness next day in Case 1 within a few days in Case 2 without surgical treatment. The mechanism of spontaneous resolution of ASDH was thought to involve pulsatile flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the tear in the arachnoid membrane, resulting in redistribution and dispersal of the hematoma, and retrograde flow into the subarachnoid space. The characteristic feature of the CT findings, the low density band between the hematoma and the inner wall of the skull bone, probably shows this process. Spontaneous resolution of ASDH requires that the brain compensatory function maintains the normal outflow of CSF, and controls the intracranial pressure by CSF buffering, blood outflow via the venous system, and brain elasticity. The low density band may be a useful finding to distinguish cases with good and Lad prognosis.

TI The "Lund Concept" for the treatment of severe head trauma -:
   physiological principles and clinical application
SO INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB The Lund Concept is an approach to the treatment of severe brain trauma that is mainly based on hypotheses originating from basic physiological principles regarding brain volume and cerebral perfusion regulation. Its main attributes have found support in experimental and clinical studies. This review explains the principles of the Lund Concept and is intended to serve as the current guide for its clinical application. The therapy has two main goals: (1) to reduce or prevent an increase in ICP (ICP-targeted goal) and (2) to improve perfusion and oxygenation around contusions (perfusion-targeted goal). The Lund therapy considers the consequences of a disrupted blood-brain barrier for development of brain oedema and the specific consequences of a rigid dura/cranium for general cerebral haemodynamics. It calls attention to the importance of improving perfusion and oxygenation of the injured areas of the brain. This is achieved by normal blood oxygenation, by maintaining normovolaemia with normal haematocrit and plasma protein concentrations, and by antagonizing vasoconstriction through reduction of catecholamine concentration in plasma and sympathetic discharge (minimizing stress and by refraining from vasoconstrictors and active cooling). The therapeutic measures mean normalization of all essential haemodynamic parameters (blood pressure, plasma oncotic pressure, plasma and erythrocyte volumes, PaO2, PaCO2) the use of enteral nutrition, and avoidance of overnutrition. To date, clinical outcome studies using the Lund Concept have shown favourable results.

TI A Case Report of Pseudotumor Cerebri Syndrome with a Huge
   Retroperitoneal Cyst
SO MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB Background: Aside from primary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS) with an unknown etiology (i.e., idiopathic intracranial hypertension), which typically occurs in association with obesity, several conditions including cerebral venous abnormalities, drug use, and hormonal imbalance may be a secondary cause of PTCS. However, a focal space-occupying lesion outside of the brain as a cause of PTCS has rarely been reported. Case Presentation: A previously healthy 34-year-old man presented with blurred vision for three weeks. The patient had a three-month preceding history of worsening headache. On admission, he was hypertensive (160/90 mmHg) and underweight with a body mass index of 18.4 kg/m2. Fundus examination documented papilledema in both eyes. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for mild nuchal rigidity, and results of routine serologic testing were normal. Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral posterior scleral flattening, suggesting intracranial hypertension. There was no other abnormal brain parenchymal lesion or meningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assay showed a markedly increased opening pressure (30.0 cmH2O) with normal CSF composition. A tentative diagnosis of PTCS was made based on ophthalmological, neuroradiological, and laboratory findings. During differential diagnosis, abdomen computed tomography demonstrated a huge benign cystic lesion (14.7 x 10.6 x 16.4 cm) in the right retroperitoneal space, which originated from the mesentery and resulted in hydronephrosis and renovascular hypertension due to external compression of the right kidney. Other evaluations were unremarkable. After successful surgical removal of the cyst, clinical symptoms such as headache, blurred vision, and papilledema on fundus examination were markedly improved, and blood pressure was normalized during the three-month follow-up period. Conclusions: A large retroperitoneal cyst that can increase intra-abdominal pressure could be a rare cause of PTCS. Therefore, meticulous evaluation is warranted for patients with PTCS, especially those without known risk factors.

TI Intravascular volume expansion during therapeutic moderate hypothermia

SP Japanese Assoc Brain Hypothermia
AB Hemodynamic depressions during moderate hypothermia may worsen cerebral ischemia after brain injury. In this preliminary report, we examined retrospectively the effects of intravascular volume expansion on hemodynamic changes, intracranial pressure (ICP),and internal jugular oxygen saturation (SJO(2)) in seven brain-injured patients, who were selected because of their elevated ICPs even after induction of hypothermia. All patients were ventilated, and hypothermia was induced by surface cooling using midazolam, buprenorphine, and vecuronium. After the hypothermic period (divided into the initial, middle, and late phases), patients were gradually re warmed at a rate of approximately 1 degrees C per day. Mean blood pressure (MBP),central venous pressure (CVP),cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP),cardiac output (CO), ICP, and SJO(2) were measured. Despite a large amount of infusion ranging from approximately 4000 to 5000 ml/day, ICP decreased from the middle phase compared to the initial phase of the therapy. After such volume expansion, higher levels of CVP (ranging from 9.7 +/- 0.8 to 10.7 +/- 1.5 mmHg) were found during the hypothermic period in association with CO levels (5.2 +/- 0.1 to 5.3 +/- 0.21/min) similar to those of normothermia. Sustained CPP was accompanied by reduced ICP, increased SIG,, and augmented CO. These results suggest that even a large amount of infusion to the brain-injured patients decreases ICP and improves CO during moderate hypothermia, which may be beneficial to the cerebral circulation and metabolism in the patients. The current study warrants further future studies to test such a hypothesis.

TI Clinico-radiological correlation of magnetic resonance imaging findings
   in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Purpose Although several studies have reported imaging findings associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), less is known about the correlation between imaging findings and IIH-related symptoms or signs. Our study aimed to determine if clinical features of IIH are correlated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features.
   Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted on consecutive patients presenting at the neuro-ophthalmology department over the last 15 years. All patients diagnosed with IIH were identified and those with available MRI were included in the final analysis. All MRI images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist blinded to the presenting symptoms and signs. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the correlation between the MRI findings with each clinical symptom or sign.
   Results Thirty-one out of 88 patients with the initial diagnosis of IIH had MRI available and were included in the study. Significant correlations were observed between colour vision and amount of perineural fluid around the optic nerve on MRI (r = -0.382; p = 0.004), disc assessment and intraocular optic nerve protrusion (r = 0.364; p = 0.004), disc assessment and perineural fluid around the optic nerve (r = 0.276; p = 0.033) and disc assessment and venous sinus stenosis (r = 0.351; p = 0.009).
   Conclusion Our study highlights correlations between imaging and clinical findings of IIH. MRI findings in IIH may be useful in ruling out ominous causes of intracranial pressure and risk stratifying ophthalmologic intervention and management of patients with headaches possibly due to IIH.

TI Is cerebral perfusion pressure a major determinant of cerebral blood
   flow during head elevation in comatose patients with severe intracranial
   lesions?
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Object. Head elevation as a treatment for lower intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with intracranial hypertension has been challenged in recent years. Therefore, the authors studied the effect of head position on cerebral hemodynamics in patients with severe head injury.
   Methods. The effect of 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees head elevation on ICP, cerebral blood flow (CBF), systemic arterial (Psa(Monro)) and jugular bulb (Pj) pressures calibrated to the level of the foramen of Monro, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and the arteriovenous pressure gradient (Psa(Monro) - Pj) was studied in 37 patients who were comatose due to severe intracranial lesions. The CBF decreased gradually with head elevation from 0 to 45 degrees, from 46.3 +/- 4.8 to 28.7 +/- 2.3 ml . min(-1) . 100 g(-1) (mean +/- standard error, p < 0.01), and the Psa(Monro) - Pj from 80 +/- 3 to 73 +/- 3 mm Hg (p < 0.01). The CPP remained stable between 0 degrees and 30 degrees of head elevation, at 62 +/- 3 mm Hg, and decreased from 62 +/- 3 to 57 +/- 4 mm Hg between 30 degrees and 45 degrees (p < 0.05), A simulation showed that the 38% decrease in CBF between 0 degrees and 45 degrees resulted from Psa(Monro) - Pj changes for 19% of the decrease, from a diversion of the venous drainage from the internal jugular veins to vertebral venous plexus for 15%, and from CPP changes for 4%.
   Conclusions. During head elevation the arteriovenous pressure gradient is the major determinant of CBF. The influence of CPP on CBF decreases from 0 to 45 degrees of head elevation.

TI The Influence of Body Position on Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Gradient
   and Movement in Cats with Normal and Impaired Craniospinal Communication
SO PLOS ONE
AB Intracranial hypertension is a severe therapeutic problem, as there is insufficient knowledge about the physiology of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. In this paper a new CSF pressure regulation hypothesis is proposed. According to this hypothesis, the CSF pressure depends on the laws of fluid mechanics and on the anatomical characteristics inside the cranial and spinal space, and not, as is today generally believed, on CSF secretion, circulation and absorption. The volume and pressure changes in the newly developed CSF model, which by its anatomical dimensions and basic biophysical features imitates the craniospinal system in cats, are compared to those obtained on cats with and without the blockade of craniospinal communication in different body positions. During verticalization, a long-lasting occurrence of negative CSF pressure inside the cranium in animals with normal cranio-spinal communication was observed. CSF pressure gradients change depending on the body position, but those gradients do not enable unidirectional CSF circulation from the hypothetical site of secretion to the site of absorption in any of them. Thus, our results indicate the existence of new physiological/pathophysiological correlations between intracranial fluids, which opens up the possibility of new therapeutic approaches to intracranial hypertension.

TI Low pressure hydrocephalus: clinical manifestations, radiological
   characteristics, and treatment
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB Low pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) is a rare type of hydrocephalus with low intracranial pressure and ventriculomegaly. The recognition of LPH is important, and the treatment is difficult and very complicated. An understanding of how to drain cerebrospinal fluid when the intracranial pressure is lower than the opening pressure of the value represents a critical issue. Seven patients who suffered from the pain of hydrocephalus syndrome and were diagnosed with LPH were retrospectively reviewed. A ventricle peritoneal shunt was applied to all patients, and the valve system was adjusted to the lowest pressure; however, the clinical manifestations of hydrocephalus in five of seven patients did not improve over one week. Intermittent pressing of the valve in combination with the maintenance of a semi-reclined position were subsequently implemented. The symptoms of hydrocephalus began to improve from three days to two months following the initiation of intermittent valve pressing in combination with the maintenance of a semi-reclined position. At the twelve months follow up, six of seven patients (85.7%) showed good recovery to minimal disability. Intermittent valve pressing in combination with a semi-reclined position is an effective and easy method to drain cerebrospinal fluid when the intracranial pressure (ICP) is lower than the opening pressure of the value and improve hydrocephalus symptoms.

TI Neurogenic pulmonary edema and other mechanisms of impaired oxygenation
   after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
SO NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB Introduction: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) affects 30,000 patients per year, causing neurologic morbidity and mortality. The etiology of hypoxemia and its role in comorbidity are controversial and unknown.
   Purpose: To identify the incidence and etiologies of oxygenation abnormalities following SAH and to determine its impact on length of hospital stay (LOS).
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 70 consecutive SAH patients' records, including review of computed tomography scans, chest X-rays, arterial blood gases, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, blood pressure, carbon monoxide, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Fluid balance and chest X-ray interpretation on admission and at time of worst alveolar-arterial oxygen difference was assessed, as was length of hospital stay.
   Results: Fifty six (80%) patients had impaired oxygenation (alveolar-arterial oxygen difference >100 mmHg). Of these 56, 50% had normal chest Xrays. Patients were euvolemic and normodynamic with mean central venous pressure 8.8 +/- 4.1 mmHg and had normal cardiac output 6.8 +/- 2.4 L/min. The most frequent etiologies of hypoxemia based on composite data assessment were pneumonia 8/56 (14%), fulminant neurogenic pulmonary edema 9/56 (16%), atelectasis 5/56 (27%), and cryptogenic (57%). The mean length of stay was doubled in the impaired oxygenation group 19.3 days 14.6 compared with 7.1 +/- 4.3 days in the normal oxygenation group (p<0.001; df=36). Likewise, the patients with fulminant neurogenic pulmonary edema had a prolonged length of stay of 13.4 +/- 6.2 (p<0.002; df=27) compared with the normal oxygenation group. Neither the occurrence of vasospasm nor delayed neurologic deficit influenced the incidence of poor oxygenation (p<0.93).
   Conclusion: Oxygenation abnormalities after SAH occur more frequently than previously suspected. They are frequently the result of noncardiogenic and hydrostatic causes and contribute to an increased length of hospital stay.

TI Chiari malformation in craniosynostosis
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Introduction: Chiari malformation (CM) is a frequent finding in multisutural and syndromic craniosynostosis, occurring in 70% of patients with Crouzon's syndrome, 75% with oxycephaly, 50% with Pfeiffer's syndrome and 100% with the Kleeblattschadel deformity. The pathogenesis of this condition and rationale for treatment are still controversial. Discussion: Since its first description in 1972, several factors have been cited to play a role in inducing CM. In the light of recent publications, the roles of premature fusion of cranial vault and cranial base sutures, of congenital anomalies of the cerebellum and brain stem, of raised intracranial pressure, of venous hypertension and of hydrocephalus are reviewed. Evaluation and management of CM are also discussed. Conclusion: Chiari malformation appears to be an acquired and progressive condition that develops in the first months of life, because of a disproportion between hindbrain growth and an abnormally small posterior fossa, a consequence of the premature fusion of lambdoid and cranial base sutures. Venous hypertension caused by stenosis of the jugular foramen can also be present in these patients, resulting in intracranial hypertension and/or hydrocephalus. Careful MRI evaluation is recommended for the forms of craniosynostosis at a high risk of developing hindbrain herniation. The selection of posterior cranial vault expansion as the first surgical procedure is advocated. In selected cases, treatment of the posterior cranial deformity by occipital vault remodelling and treatment of the Chiari-like deformity by suboccipital decompression can be carried out using the same surgical procedure.

TI The Lund Concept for the Treatment of Patients With Severe Traumatic
   Brain Injury
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Two different main concepts for the treatment of a severe traumatic brain injury have been established during the last 15 years, namely the more conventional concept recommended in well-established guidelines (eg, U.S. Guideline, European Guideline, Addelbrook's Guideline from Cambridge), on the one hand, and the Lund concept from the University Hospital of Lund, Sweden, on the other. Owing to the lack of well-controlled randomized outcome studies comparing these 2 main therapeutic approaches, we cannot conclude that one is better than the other. This paper is the PRO part in a PRO-CON debate in this journal on the Lund concept. Although the Lund concept is based on a physiology-oriented approach dealing with the hemodynamic principles of brain volume and brain perfusion regulation, traditional treatments are primarily based on a meta-analytic approach from clinical studies. High cerebral perfusion pressure has been an essential goal in the conventional treatments (the cerebral perfusion pressure-guided approach), even though it has been modified in a recent up date of U.S. guidelines. The Lund concept has instead concentrated on management of brain edema and intracranial pressure, along with improvement of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (the intracranial pressure and perfusion-guided approach). Although conventional guidelines are restricted to clinical data from meta-analytic surveys, the physiological approach of Lund therapy finds support in both experimental and clinical studies. It offers a wider base and can also provide recommendations regarding fluid therapy, lung protection, optimal hemoglobin concentration, temperature control, the use of decompressive craniotomy, and ventricular drainage. This paper puts forward arguments in support of Lund therapy.

TI MRI evidence for preserved regulation of intracranial pressure in
   patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate intracranial pressure and associated hemo- and hydrodynamic parameters in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations AVMs.
   Methods: Thirty consecutive patients with arteriovenous malformations (median age 38.7 years, 27/30 previously treated with radiosurgery) and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were investigated on a 3.0 T MR scanner. Nidus volume was quantified on dynamic MR angiography. Total arterial cerebral blood flow (tCBF), venous outflow as well as aqueductal and craniospinal stroke volumes were obtained using velocity-encoded cine-phase contrast MRI. Intracranial volume change during the cardiac cycle was calculated and intracranial pressure (ICP) was derived from systolic intracranial volume change (ICVC) and pulse pressure gradient.
   Results: TCBF was significantly higher in AVM patients as compared to healthy controls (median 799 vs. 692 mL/min, p = 0.007). There was a trend for venous flow to be increased in both the ipsilateral internal jugular vein (IJV, 282 vs. 225 mL/min, p = 0.16), and in the contralateral IJV (322 vs. 285 mL/min, p = 0.09), but not in secondary veins. There was no significant difference in median ICP between AVM patients and control subjects (6.9 vs. 8.6 mmHg, p = 0.30) and ICP did not correlate with nidus volume in AVM patients (rho = -0.06, p = 0.74). There was a significant positive correlation between tCBF and craniospinal CSF stroke volume (rho = 0.69, p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: The elevated cerebral blood flow in patients with AVMs is drained through an increased flow in IJVs but not secondary veins. ICP is maintained within ranges of normal and does not correlate with nidus volume. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA
AB The aim of this study was to examine how traumatic spinal cord injury is managed in the United Kingdom via a questionnaire survey of all neurosurgical units. We contacted consultant neurosurgeons and neuroanesthetists in all neurosurgical centers that manage patients with acute spinal cord injury. Two clinical scenarios-of complete and incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries-were given to determine local treatment policies. There were 175 responders from the 33 centers (36% response rate). We ascertained neurosurgical views on urgency of transfer, timing of surgery, nature and aim of surgery, as well as neuroanesthetic views on type of anesthetic, essential intraoperative monitoring, drug treatment, and intensive care management. Approximately 70% of neurosurgeons will admit patients with incomplete spinal cord injury immediately, but only 40% will admit patients with complete spinal cord injury immediately. There is no consensus on the timing or even the role of surgery for incomplete or complete injuries. Most (96%) neuroanesthetists avoid anesthetics known to elevate intracranial pressure. What was deemed essential intraoperative monitoring, however, varied widely. Many (22%) neuroanesthetists do not routinely measure arterial blood pressure invasively, central venous pressure (85%), or cardiac output (94%) during surgery. There is no consensus among neuroanesthetists on the optimal levels of arterial blood pressure, or oxygen and carbon dioxide partial arterial pressure. We report wide variability among U. K. neurosurgeons and neuroanesthetists in their treatment of acute traumatic spinal cord injury. Our findings reflect the lack of Class 1 evidence that early surgical decompression and intensive medical management of patients with spinal cord injury improves neurological outcome.

TI Venous Sinus Stenting in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: Results
   of a Prospective Trial
SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Background: Our goal was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of stenting of venous sinus stenosis (VSS) in patients with medically-refractory, medically-intolerant or fulminant idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in a prospective, observational study.
   Methods: Thirteen patients with IIH who were refractory or intolerant to medical therapy or who presented with fulminant visual field (VF) loss underwent stenting of VSS at the transverse-sinus sigmoid sinus junction, using a Precise Pro carotid stent system (Cordis). Inclusion criteria included papilledema-related VF loss with mean deviation (MD) worse than or equal to 26.00 dB, elevated opening pressure (OP) on lumbar puncture (LP), VSS (either bilateral or unilateral in a dominant sinus), and an elevated (>= 8 mm Hg) trans-stenotic gradient (TSG). The main outcome measures were pre-to post-stent change in symptoms related to intracranial hypertension, MD (in dB) on automated (Humphrey) VFs, grade of papilledema (1-5), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness as measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), TSG (mm Hg), and OP on LP (cm H(2)0).
   Results: Improvement or resolution of headaches occurred in 84.7% of patients, pulse-synchronous tinnitus in 100%, diplopia in 100%, and transient visual obscuration in 100%. Out of 26 eyes, 21 showed an improvement in MD, with an average improvement of +5.40 dB. Of 24 eyes with initial papilledema, 20 showed an improvement in Frisen grade, (mean change in grade of 1.90). Of 23 eyes undergoing SD-OCT, 21 (91.3%) demonstrated a reduction in RNFL thickness, with a poststent mean thickness of 90.48 mm. Mean change in OP was 220 cm H2O (reduction in mean from 42 to 22 cm H(2)0) with all subjects demonstrating a reduction, although a second stenting procedure was necessary in one patient. Complications of the stenting procedure included one small, self-limited retroperitoneal hemorrhage, transient head or pelvic pain, and one allergic reaction to contrast. No serious adverse events occurred.
   Conclusions: Stenting of VSS is safe and results in reduction of intracranial pressure in patients with IIH. This is associated with improvement in papilledema, RNFL thickness, VF parameters, and symptoms associated with intracranial hypertension. (C) 2016 by North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society

TI Inspiratory impedance threshold device effects on hypotension in
   heat-stroked swine
SO AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Introduction: Heatstroke is still an epidemiologically relevant disease with overall mortality rates as high as 15-33%. In heat stroke, hypotension is caused by relative central hypovolemia. We performed a feasibility study to determine if an inspiratory impedance threshold valve (ITD (TM)) set to open at - 12 cm H2O would reverse systemic hypotension by enhancing venous return in hyperthermic, hypotensive, but spontaneously breathing animals. Methods: Seven anesthetized pigs weighing 30 - 2 kg were warmed with a heating device until a mean rectal temperature of 44 degrees C was reached, and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was <= 60 mmHg. The animals were then treated with the ITD. An intravenous bolus of 200 cc of 4 degrees C normal saline was delivered 20 min after the ITD was placed, and external cooling was started. Results: Heat stroke criteria were achieved within 105 15 min. MAP had decreased from 105 +/- 5 to 57 +/- 15 mmHg, and respiratory rates had increased from 33 +/- 2 to 101 +/- 13 breaths/min. Addition of the ITD significantly improved MAP to 85 4 mmHg, and reduced respiratory rate to 54 6 breaths/min within 2 min. The effect was sustained until fluid replacement and external cooling were delivered 20 min later. At that point, MAP returned to baseline within 30 min, and 6/7 animals survived for an additional 30 min. Conclusions: Use of an inspiratory impedance threshold device resulted in an immediate rise in blood pressure in animals in heat stroke and preserved blood pressure for at least 20 min prior to cooling and fluid replacement.

TI Effect of intra-abdominal hypertension on the intraocular pressure of
   the conscious dogs
SO VETERINARY MEDICINE AND SCIENCE
AB This study was performed to evaluate the effect of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on intraocular pressure (IOP) in conscious dog models using a balloon technique to generate intra-abdominal hypertension. Six healthy dogs without ocular abnormalities were evaluated in this study. A balloon device was placed in the intra-abdominal cavity. The abdomen was insufflated to IAP levels of 15 and 25 mmHg using the balloon device. Intraocular pressure was measured at baseline, at IAP levels of 15 and 25 mmHg, and after decompression. In comparison with the mean baseline IOP (15.1 +/- 2.0 mmHg), there was a significant increase in IOP at IAP levels of 15 mmHg (20.0 +/- 2.1 mmHg) and 25 mmHg (19.9 +/- 2.2 mmHg), corresponding to a 32.4% and 31.7% increase from baseline IOP, respectively. The mean IOP after decompression (14.8 +/- 1.7 mmHg) was significantly lower compared to those at IAP levels of 15 and 25 mmHg. The present findings demonstrate that increased IAP has a clinically significant effect on IOP in dogs under conscious conditions. Although more research is needed to determine of increased IAP on IOP, these findings suggest that increased IAP leads to mild and reversible increase in IOP.

TI Improvised intracranial pressure monitors in the developing World: A
   scoping review
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY NEUROSURGERY-ADVANCED TECHNIQUES AND CASE MANAGEMENT
AB Introduction: Due to less than favorable conditions in low and low-middle-income countries, surgeons have had to carefully craft improvised devices to try and mimic the functionality and level of innovation in the developed countries. In this review, we sought to examine the existing literature to review the alternative ways by which intracranial pressure is measured when standard devices are inaccessible. Furthermore, we aimed to see how these devices are made and how much they cost. Methodology: The PRISMA extension for scoping reviews was utilized. Databases and Grey Literature (PubMed, Google Scholar, and AJOL) were searched extensively, and papers reporting on the use of improvised intracranial pressure monitoring were included. The devices were grouped into two setups and described extensively. The cost of the devices was also estimated. We extracted the relevant information after identifying the papers that would be used in our review study. Results: 3 papers satisfied our eligibility criteria and were used in the review. Two setups were discussed. The first setup involved the use of a makeshift device made up of a size 6 feeding tube/soft silicon catheter, a central venous pressure manometer and sterile 0.9% saline as the coupling agent, while the second setup involved the use of a size 8 feeding tube, a pressure line extension, dome, transducer, and monitor. Both devices cost less than USD 20, a price far cheaper than the standard ICP devices quoted at about USD 800. Conclusion: Our review posits that these makeshift devices have certain advantages and may be useful in the rural and less developed parts of the world. It also serves as an area for intervention, especially in the context of global neurosurgery.

TI INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE CHANGES DURING BILATERAL RADICAL NECK DISSECTIONS
SO HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND
   NECK
AB The management of the contralateral neck in patients with head and neck cancer who have undergone a radical neck dissection (RND) is controversial. A number of these patients will require a second RND. Sacrifice of both internal jugular veins (IJV) has been felt to lead to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) with subsequent neurologic sequelae.
   From 1987 to 1991 four patients had staged bilateral RNDs at the West Virginia University. In these patients a subarachnoid bolt was placed to directly monitor ICP. Jugular bulb, mean arterial, pulmonary artery, and central venous pressures were monitored. Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring was also performed. All patients demonstrated elevations in ICP immediately on head rotation. Further marked elevations were noted immediately after IJV ligation with a maximum peak at 30 minutes. Pressure levels of greater than 40 mm Hg were observed in three of four patients. Systemic hypertension was observed in response to elevated ICP (Cushing's reflex). All patients studied recovered from surgery without significant sequelae. Within 24 hours the ICP had returned to normal in all patients. Three patients required intraoperative intervention to lower their ICP.
   We demonstrate that even in a staged second RND there are significant rises in ICP. These are to a level that suggests emergency medical intervention is required. We feel that when the second IJV is sacrificed an increase in ICP should be anticipated, monitored, and treated accordingly. (C) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI Differential effects of isotonic and hypotonic 4% albumin solution on
   intracranial pressure and renal perfusion and function
SO CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION
AB Objectives: Albumin is used to resuscitate trauma patients but may increase intracranial pressure (ICP). Its effects on renal blood flow and function are unknown. Our aim was to examine the effects of hypertonic albumin on ICP and renal function, and if any effects are due to the hypotonicity of the solution containing albumin or to albumin itself.
   Design, setting and subjects: Cross-over, randomised controlled experimental study of six adult Merino ewes in the animal facility of a research institute.
   Method: Sheep were implanted with flow probes around the pulmonary and renal arteries and an ICP monitoring catheter in a lateral cerebral ventricle. Conscious sheep received normal saline, commercially available hypotonic 4% albumin solution (4% Albumex [278 mOsm/kg]) or a novel isotonic 4% albumin solution (288 mOsm/kg), with at least 48 hours between each intervention.
   Results: Commercial hypotonic albumin solution increased ICP (by 8.5 mmHg [SEM, 2.1 mmHg]; P < 0.01), but neither isotonic albumin solution nor saline significantly changed ICP. The increase in ICP with hypotonic albumin solution was associated with an increase in central venous pressure (CVP) (by 5.4 mmHg [SEM, 0.6 mmHg]; P < 0.001), but no significant changes in cardiac output or stroke volume. None of the infusions changed renal blood flow, plasma creatinine level, creatinine clearance or plasma or urinary electrolyte levels.
   Conclusion: Compared with saline or isotonic albumin solution, hypotonic albumin solution increased ICP and CVP, but did not alter arterial pressure, cardiac output renal blood flow or renal function. Our findings support the view that the tonicity of the albumin solution, rather than the albumin itself, is responsible for increasing ICP.

AB Background: Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) can become fatal; however, it has rarely been described as a complication of burn injury. This study clarified the physiologic results of abdominal decompression (AD) for ACS in patients with burn injury in detail.
   Methods: Extensively burned patients admitted to our burn unit between January 2003 and February 2004 were prospectively monitored by pulmonary artery catheter. Physiologic parameters from the catheter, blood gas analysis, intrabladder pressure as a parameter of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), peak inspiratory pressure, and urine output (UO) were compared before and after escharotomy as AD in patients with ACS.
   Results: Eight of 36 patients who had sustained more than 30% total body surface area burn developed ACS requiring AD in 18.3 +/- 4.9 hours. AD significantly decreased IAP (52 +/- 9 cm H2O vs. 26 7 cm H2O), peak inspiratory pressure (53 +/- 13 cm H2O vs. 35 6 cm H2O), heart rate, and Paco(2) and increased cardiac index (1.6 +/- 0.7 L/min/m(2) vs. 2.5 +/- 0.9 L/min/m(2)), abdominal perfusion pressure (50 11 mm Hg vs. 72 +/- 17 mm Hg), UO (0.45 +/- 0.46 mL/h/kg vs. 2.0 +/- 2.1 mL/h/kg), and oxygen delivery index (290 +/- 195 mL/m(2)/min vs. 455 +/- 218 mL/m(2)/min). Impaired oxygen consumption index increased (86 +/- 43 mL/m(2)/min vs. 153 +/- 58 mL/m(2)/min) after AD.
   Conclusion: In patients with severe burn injury, elevated IAP makes pulmonary artery wedge pressure and UO unreliable indices of preload or intravascular volume, and decreases abdominal perfusion in the resuscitation period. AD in these patients significantly improves the ventilation, hemodynamic parameters, and oxygen inetabolism.

TI Abdominal compartment syndrome in critically ill patients
SO ACUTE AND CRITICAL CARE
AB Intra-abdominal hypertension can have severe consequences, including abdominal compartment syndrome, which can contribute to multi-organ failure. An increase in intra-abdominal hypertension is influenced by factors such as diminished abdominal wall compliance, increased intraluminal content, and certain systemic conditions. Regular measurement of intra-abdominal pressure is essential, and particular attention must be paid to patient positioning. Nonsurgical treatments, such as decompression of intraluminal content using a nasogastric tube, percutaneous drainage, and fluid balance optimization, play crucial roles. Additionally, point-of-care ultrasonography aids in the diagnosis and treatment of intra-abdominal hypertension. Emphasizing the importance of regular measurements, timely decompressive laparotomy is a definitive, but complex, treatment option. Balancing the urgency of surgical intervention against potential postoperative complications is challenging.

TI Space physiology VI: exercise, artificial gravity, and countermeasure
   development for prolonged space flight
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB When applied individually, exercise countermeasures employed to date do not fully protect the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems during prolonged spaceflight. Recent ground-based research suggests that it is necessary to perform exercise countermeasures within some form of artificial gravity to prevent microgravity deconditioning. In this regard, it is important to provide normal foot-ward loading and intravascular hydrostatic-pressure gradients to maintain musculoskeletal and cardiovascular function. Aerobic exercise within a centrifuge restores cardiovascular function, while aerobic exercise within lower body negative pressure restores cardiovascular function and helps protect the musculoskeletal system. Resistive exercise with vibration stimulation may increase the effectiveness of resistive exercise by preserving muscle function, allowing lower intensity exercises, and possibly reducing risk of loss of vision during prolonged spaceflight. Inexpensive methods to induce artificial gravity alone (to counteract head-ward fluid shifts) and exercise during artificial gravity (for example, by short-arm centrifuge or exercise within lower body negative pressure) should be developed further and evaluated as multi-system countermeasures.

TI Characteristics and Outcomes of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
   Treatment in Intrinsic and Extrinsic Stenosis: A Single-Center
   Experience in China
SO NEUROLOGY AND THERAPY
AB Introduction This study aimed to explore the precipitating factors and evaluate the impact of different stenosis types on treatment outcomes in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and venous sinus stenosis (VSS). Methods We recruited patients with IIH who presented with VSS, either intrinsic or extrinsic. We observed the clinical and laboratory findings, and we then compared the outcomes of stenting and medical treatment in different stenosis types. Results Among 145 patients with IIH and VSS, 59 were of the intrinsic type and 86 were of the extrinsic type. Patients in the intrinsic group were older (42 vs. 34 years old, P < 0.001) and presented with higher pre-op gradient pressure (15 mmHg vs. 12 mmHg, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups regarding other precipitating factors (P > 0.05). Stenting was significantly associated with complete resolution of the headache and impaired vision both in intrinsic (adjusted OR 0.017, 95% CI 0.001-0.35, P = 0.011; adjusted OR 0.056, 95% CI 0.004-0.697, P = 0.025, respectively) and extrinsic types of stenosis (adjusted OR 0.072, 95% CI 0.015-0.343, P = 0.001; adjusted OR 0.241, 95% CI 0.062-0.931, P = 0.039, respectively). Meanwhile, stenting was significantly associated with improvement of the papilledema in extrinsic-type stenosis compared with medical treatment (adjusted OR 0.017, 95% CI 0.002-0.135, P < 0.001). Conclusion Stenting may provide substantial clinical improvement in patients with IIH regardless of intrinsic or extrinsic stenosis type in our patient population, as noted in other series.

TI Assessment of cerebrovascular alterations induced by inflammatory
   response and oxidative-nitrative stress after traumatic intracranial
   hypertension and a potential mitigation strategy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The rapid perfusion of cerebral arteries leads to a significant increase in intracranial blood volume, exposing patients with traumatic brain injury to the risk of diffuse brain swelling or malignant brain herniation during decompressive craniectomy. The microcirculation and venous system are also involved in this process, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. A physiological model of extremely high intracranial pressure was created in rats. This development triggered the TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B/iNOS axis in microglia, and released many inflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species, generating an excessive amount of peroxynitrite. Subsequently, the capillary wall cells especially pericytes exhibited severe degeneration and injury, the blood-brain barrier was disrupted, and a large number of blood cells were deposited within the microcirculation, resulting in a significant delay in the recovery of the microcirculation and venous blood flow compared to arterial flow, and this still persisted after decompressive craniectomy. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody bound to TNF-alpha that effectively reduces the activity of TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B/iNOS axis. Treatment with Infliximab resulted in downregulation of inflammatory and oxidative-nitrative stress related factors, attenuation of capillary wall cells injury, and relative reduction of capillary hemostasis. These improved the delay in recovery of microcirculation and venous blood flow.

SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB IntroductionLaxative suppository agent is oftenly used for patient with constipation due to its effectiveness and rapid onset. However, beside the benefit of the drugs, it could cause several side effects which could lead to life-threatening complication. In this report, we present a rare case of laxative's side effect that leads to fatal complication in pediatric patient with history of hydrocephalus and ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt placement.Case reportAn 11 years old boy admitted with general weakness, low nutrition intake, and constipation for 4 days. Patient had a history of VP shunt surgery at half months old due to congenital hydrocephalus. Abdominal X-ray found colon dilatation and fecal material collection. Laxative suppository agent was given to the patient. An hour after the treatment, patient had an abdominal pain followed by defecation, and 30 min after defecation, patient was unresponsive with irregular breathing followed by cardiac arrest. Code blue was activated and resuscitation was done for about 40 min, and patient did not respond to resuscitation and pronounced dead 2.5 h after drug's administration.DiscussionThe pathophysiology of this complication is related with elevated intraabdominal pressure that caused abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), and this condition could lead to several organ dysfunction such as cardiopulmonary and abdominal organ dysfunction inducing central nervous system impairment through raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Pediatric patient with history of hydrocephalus on VP shunt could have a low brain compliance and very susceptible to fatal complication due to acute raised of ICP.ConclusionLaxative suppository agent on pediatric patient with hydrocephalus on VP shunt could lead to fatal complication through ACS and acute elevated ICP pressure. Oral laxative agent should be chosen in constipated patient with neurologic preexisting condition, and patient should be closely monitored if suppository agent is given.

TI Intrathoracic Pressure Regulator Performance in the Setting of
   Hemorrhage and Acute Lung Injury
SO MILITARY MEDICINE
CT Military Health Systems Research Symposium
CY AUG 19-22, 2019
CL Kissimmee, FL
AB Introduction
   Intrathoracic pressure regulation (ITPR) can be utilized to enhance venous return and cardiac preload by inducing negative end expiratory pressure in mechanically ventilated patients. Previous preclinical studies have shown increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and decreased intracranial pressure (ICP) with use of an ITPR device. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic and respiratory effects of ITPR in a porcine polytrauma model of hemorrhagic shock and acute lung injury (ALI).
   Methods
   Swine were anesthetized and underwent a combination of sham, hemorrhage, and/or lung injury. The experimental groups included: no injury with and without ITPR (ITPR, Sham), hemorrhage with and without ITPR (ITPR/Hem, Hem), and hemorrhage and ALI with and without ITPR (ITPR/Hem/ALI, Hem/ALI). The ITPR device was initiated at a setting of -3 cmH(2)O and incrementally decreased by 3 cmH(2)O after 30 minutes on each setting, with 15 minutes allowed for recovery between settings, to a nadir of -12 cmH(2)O. Histopathological analysis of the lungs was scored by blinded, independent reviewers. Of note, all animals were chemically paralyzed for the experiments to suppress gasping at ITPR pressures below -6 cmH(2)O.
   Results
   Adequate shock was induced in the hemorrhage model, with the MAP being decreased in the Hem and ITPR/Hem group compared with Sham and ITPR/Sham, respectively, at all time points (Hem 54.2 +/- 6.5 mmHg vs. 88.0 +/- 13.9 mmHg, p < 0.01, -12 cmH(2)O; ITPR/Hem 59.5 +/- 14.4 mmHg vs. 86.7 +/- 12.1 mmHg, p < 0.01, -12 cmH(2)O). In addition, the PaO2/FIO2 ratio was appropriately decreased in Hem/ALI compared with Sham and Hem groups (231.6 +/- 152.5 vs. 502.0 +/- 24.6 (Sham) p < 0.05 vs. 463.6 +/- 10.2, (Hem) p < 0.01, -12 cmH(2)O). Heart rate was consistently higher in the ITPR/Hem/ALI group compared with the Hem/ALI group (255 +/- 26 bpm vs. 150.6 +/- 62.3 bpm, -12 cmH(2)O) and higher in the ITPR/Hem group compared with Hem. Respiratory rate (adjusted to maintain pH) was also higher in the ITPR/Hem/ALI group compared with Hem/ALI at -9 and - 12 cmH(2)O (32.8 +/- 3.0 breaths per minute (bpm) vs. 26.8 +/- 3.6 bpm, -12 cmH(2)O) and higher in the ITPR/Hem group compared with Hem at -6, -9, and - 12 cmH(2)O. Lung compliance and end expiratory lung volume (EELV) were both consistently decreased in all three ITPR groups compared with their controls. Histopathologic severity of lung injury was worse in the ITPR and ALI groups compared with their respective injured controls or Sham.
   Conclusion
   In this swine polytrauma model, we demonstrated successful establishment of hemorrhage and combined hemorrhage/ALI models. While ITPR did not demonstrate a benefit for MAP or ICP, our data demonstrate that the ITPR device induced tachycardia with associated increase in cardiac output, as well as tachypnea with decreased lung compliance, EELV, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and worse histopathologic lung injury. Therefore, implementation of the ITPR device in the setting of polytrauma may compromise pulmonary function without significant hemodynamic improvement.

TI Detecting changes in distortion product otoacoustic emission maps using
   statistical parametric mapping and random field theory
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) maps collect DPOAE emissions over a broad range of frequencies and ratios. One application of DPOAE mapping could be monitoring changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) in space, where non-invasive measures of ICP are an area of interest. Data were collected in two experiments to statistically assess changes in DPOAE maps. A repeatability study where four maps per subject were collected across four weeks to establish "normal" variability in DPOAE data, and a posture study where subjects were measured supine and prone with lower body negative pressure, lower body positive pressure (LBPP), and at atmospheric pressure. DPOAE amplitude maps were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping and random field theory. Postural changes produced regional changes in the maps, specifically in the range of 5-7.5 kHz and between primary tone ratios of 1.13-1.24. These regional changes were most pronounced in the prone LBPP condition, where amplitudes were lower from baseline for the Postural Cohort than the Repeatability Cohort. Statistical parametric mapping provided a sensitive measure of regional DPOAE map changes, which may be useful clinically to monitor ICP noninvasively in individuals or for research to identify differences within in cohorts of people.

TI Identification of the Upward Movement of Human CSF <i>In Vivo</i> and
   its Relation to the Brain Venous System
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB CSF flux is involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury, all hallmarked by the accumulation of cellular metabolic waste. Its effective disposal via various CSF routes has been demonstrated in animal models. In contrast, the CSF dynamics in humans are still poorly understood. Using novel real-time MRI, forced inspiration has been identified recently as a main driving force of CSF flow in the human brain. Exploiting technical advances toward real-time phase-contrast MRI, the current work analyzed directions, velocities, and volumes of human CSF flow within the brain aqueduct as part of the internal ventricular system and in the spinal canal during respiratory cycles. A consistent upward CSF movement toward the brain in response to forced inspiration was seen in all subjects at the aqueduct, in 11/12 subjects at thoracic level 2, and in 4/12 subjects at thoracic level 5. Concomitant analyses of CSF dynamics and cerebral venous blood flow, that is, in epidural veins at cervical level 3, uniquely demonstrated CSF and venous flow to be closely communicating cerebral fluid systems in which inspiration-induced downward flow of venous blood due to reduced intrathoracic pressure is counterbalanced by an upward movement of CSF. The results extend our understanding of human CSF flux and open important clinical implications, including concepts for drug delivery and new classifications and therapeutic options for various forms of hydrocephalus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

TI Management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in children utilizing
   venous sinus stenting
SO INTERVENTIONAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Background
   Venous sinus stenting (VSS) is an accepted and minimally invasive treatment for adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) associated with lateral sinus stenosis (LSS). The efficacy and safety of venous sinus stenting (VSS) in children with IIH has not been established.
   Methods
   This is a retrospective analysis of IIH patients 18 years of age or younger with LSS treated with VSS at our institution. Included patients have fulminant disease course or are refractory or intolerant to medical management.
   Results
   Eight patients were identified; 4 males and 4 females. Mean age is 13.4 years (range 4-18). All patients had severe headaches, 5 had blurred vision, 3 had diplopia and 3 had pulsatile tinnitus. Papilledema was present in 4 patients. Three patients had prior surgical procedures. Four patients were intolerant to medical management, 3 were refractory and 1 had fulminant course. Cerebral venography demonstrated severe stenosis of the dominant sinus in 6 patients and of bilateral co-dominant sinuses in 2 patients. Six patients had intrinsic stenosis and 2 had extrinsic stenosis. Venous sinus stenting (VSS) resulted in improvement of symptoms, papilledema and normalization of CSF opening pressure in 7 patients. No immediate complications were observed. Mean follow-up period is 21 months (range 6-42). Two patients required re-stenting; one responded well and the other had persistent symptoms and underwent subsequent surgical procedures of CSF diversion, suboccipital decompression and duraplasty which were also ineffective.
   Conclusion
   VSS may provide a viable option for pediatric IIH patients who are intolerant to medication, have failed conservative management or prior surgical interventions, or present with fulminant disease.

TI The River study: the first prospective multicenter trial of a novel
   venous sinus stent for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background The River stent is the first stent specifically designed for intracranial venous sinuses. We report the 1-year results of the River trial, performed to obtain Humanitarian Device Exemption approval of the River stent in the United States (US).Methods The River trial was a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial which enrolled 39 subjects at 5 US centers. Eligible patients had clinical diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with severe headaches or visual field loss and had failed medical therapy. The primary safety endpoint was the 1-year rate of major adverse events compared with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting using historical controls. The primary benefit endpoint was a composite at 1 year of clinical improvement and absence of venous sinus stenosis. Secondary endpoints included improvement in pulsatile tinnitus, visual symptoms, quality of life (QOL) scores, and medications.Results All procedures were technically successful. There was one serious adverse event, a gastrointestinal hemorrhage observed 2 months after the procedure while the patient was still on dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary safety endpoint was met with a rate of major adverse event of 5.4% versus 51.7% for CSF shunts. The primary benefit endpoint was achieved in 60% of trial participants. Additional improvements were also observed in opening CSF pressure, headaches, papilledema, pulsatile tinnitus, visual symptoms, and QOL scores. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that subjects with minimal or absent papilledema at baseline showed similar improvement compared with subjects with papilledema at baseline, in terms of headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, and QOL.Conclusions The River study 1- year results establish safety and suggest efficacy for venous sinus stenting in IIH subjects who have failed medical therapy.

TI Management of a Persistent Oblique Occipital Sinus with Staged Ligation
   in a Case of Medulloblastoma: A Case Report
SO PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY
AB Introduction: A patent persistent occipital sinus (OS) can be seen in 10% of adults. The presence of such a dominant draining OS can present as a challenge for posterior fossa surgeries. Occlusion or division of the sinus can cause venous hypertension, causing a cerebellar bulge or increased intra-op bleeding. Case report: A 3-and-a-half-year-old female child presented with a vermian medulloblastoma with hydrocephalus. MR venography (MRV) revealed a large patent OS draining from the torcula to the right sigmoid sinus. She underwent a left Frazier's point VP shunt followed by a midline suboccipital craniotomy for the lesion. The OS was divided during a "Y"-shaped durotomy. Following the sinus ligation, there was a significant cerebellar bulge and excessive bleeding from the lesion. We released cisternal CSF and punctured the tumor cysts to allow the brain bulge to settle. Hemostasis was secured, and surgery was deferred, an augmented duroplasty was done, and bone flap was removed to allow for intracranial pressure decompression. The patient was electively ventilated for 24 h and weaned off gradually. A repeat MRV at 7 days showed the reorganization of the venous outflow at the torcula. Reexploration with tumor resection was done on post-op day 10. The patient recovered well from the surgery and was referred for adjuvant therapy. Conclusion: Surgeons should carefully analyze venous anatomy before posterior fossa surgeries. The persistent dominant OS, when present, should be taken care of while planning the durotomy. A hypoplastic but persistent transverse sinus allowed us to ligate and divide the OS. By doing a staged division of the sinus, reorganization of the venous outflow from the torcula can be allowed to occur, and the lesion can be resected.

TI Stenting versus balloon angioplasty alone for idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension
SO QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
AB Background: Stenting is a common approach for treating idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and venous sinus stenosis (VSS). However, studies comparing stenting with balloon angioplasty alone are lacking. This study sought to compare the clinical efficacy of balloon angioplasty and stenting in the treatment of IIH and VSS. Methods: In this single-center retrospective study, patients were divided into the following two groups: Group S, which comprised patients who underwent stenting with or without balloon angioplasty; and Group B, which comprised patients who underwent balloon angioplasty alone. From January 2018 to June 2023, the medical records of patients with IIH and VSS were evaluated to compare their postsurgical results and subsequent clinical outcomes. Results: In total, 122 participants were included in this study; 64 in Group S, and 58 in Group B. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of their initial traits. The efficacy of Group B was similar to that of Group S in terms of headache, sixth nerve palsy, and tinnitus at discharge (all P>0.05); however, the proportion of patients with resolved symptoms was significantly greater in Group S than Group B at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up (all P<0.05). The patients in Group S had a significantly lower median papilledema Fris & eacute;n grade (1 vs. 2, P<0.001), a lower mean lumbar puncture opening pressure (210.86 vs. 241.12 mmH2O, P=0.006), and a smaller mean stenosis pressure gradient (1.98 vs. 3.72 mmHg, P=0.004) than those in Group B after surgery. No statistically significant differences were detected in the complication rates between the two groups (7.8% vs. 10.3%, P=0.755). Conclusions: Compared with stenting, balloon angioplasty alone had limited short-term efficacy and unsatisfactory long-term results. Consequently, it is not recommended as a first-line treatment of IIH and VSS but rather as a complementary or adjunctive therapy to stenting.

TI Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Secondary to Idiopathic Hypertrophic
   Cranial Pachymeningitis: Case Report and Review of Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGOUND AND IMPORTANCE: Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) is a rare fibrosing inflammatory process involving the dura mater. Currently, there is no consensus on the treatments for IHCP, and the usefulness of immunosuppressive agents as a first-line option remains controversial. Cerebral venous sinus occlusion (CVSO) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) secondary to IHCP, which may cause progressive intracranial hypertension and venous obstructive parenchymal lesions, make the diagnosis and treatment of IHCP more complicated.
   METHODS: We present a case of IHCP. We also review previous cases of IHCP with secondary CVSO/CVST and then summarize the clinical characteristics of these patients.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old female patient with IHCP developed secondary CVST. She had a severe headache with a hyperintense lesion on computed tomography, which was considered as subarachnoid hemorrhage. Lumbar tapping with a cerebrospinal fluid test, in addition to gadolinium contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, suggested IHCP. Secondary CVST was identified by digital subtraction angiography and magnetic resonance venography. Fatal intracranial hypertension with severe neurologic deficits occurred, despite mannitol, furosemide, and corticoid therapy. After administration of intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide, she obtained complete remission.
   CONCLUSIONS: We experienced a patient with CVST secondary to IHCP, who was successfully treated with cyclophosphamide pulse therapy. Because IHCP with secondary venous obstruction has various differential diagnoses, venography is necessary to avoid misdiagnosis. The use of immunosuppressive agents may be promising but needs further verification.

TI Possible mechanism and Atorvastatin-based treatment in cupping
   therapy-related subdural hematoma: A case report and literature review
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Subdural hematoma (SDH) is one of the most lethal types of traumatic brain injury. SDH caused by Intracranial Pressure Reduction (ICPR) is rare, and the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report three cases of SDH that occurred after substandard cupping therapy and are conjected to be associated with ICPR. All of them had undergone cupping treatments. On the last cupping procedure, they experienced a severe headache after the cup placed on the occipital-neck junction (ONJ) was suddenly removed and were diagnosed with SDH the next day. In standard cupping therapy, the cups are not usually placed on the ONJ. We speculate that removing these cups on the soft tissue over the cisterna magna repeatedly created localized negative pressure, caused temporary but repeated ICPR, and eventually led to SDH development. The Monro-Kellie Doctrine can explain the mechanism behind this - it states that the intracranial pressure is regulated by a fixed system, with any change in one component causing a compensatory change in the other. The repeated ICPR promoted brain displacement, tearing of the bridging veins, and development of SDH. The literature was reviewed to illustrate the common etiologies and therapies of secondary ICPR-associated SDH. Despite the popularity of cupping therapy, its side effects are rarely mentioned. This case is reported to remind professional technicians to fully assess a patient's condition before cupping therapy and ensure that the cups are not placed at the ONJ.

TI Spontaneous gasping decreases intracranial pressure and improves
   cerebral perfusion in a pig model of ventricular fibrillation
SO RESUSCITATION
AB Introduction: Spontaneous gasping is associated with increased survival in animal models of cardiac arrest and in observational studies of humans. The potential beneficial effect of gasping on cerebral perfusion may underlie the observed survival benefit, but mechanisms remain unknown. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that spontaneous gasping in a pig model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) decreases intracranial pressure (ICP) and increases cerebral perfusion pressure (CePP) during VF in a pig model.
   Methods: The 13 female farm pigs, weighing between 16 and 33 kg, were anesthetized with propofol and intubated, and then had VF induced for 8 min without intervention. Intrathoracic pressure (ITP), aortic pressure (AoP), and ICP were measured continuously. CePP and ITP were recorded simultaneously during three maximal gasps and correlated with gasping by Spearman rank correlation.
   Results: Gasping during VF occurred in 13/13 pigs and followed a crescendo-decrescendo pattern. Each gasp was associated with a biphasic AoP (initial fall, then rise) and ICP (initial rise, then fait) morphology. Time to first gasp ( r(2) = 0.06), time to maximal gasp (r(2) = 0.02), duration of gasping (r(2) = 0.11) and frequency of gasping (r(2) = 0.32) did not correlate significantly with CePP during gasping while depth of gasping exhibited a weak but significant correlation with CePP (r(2) = 0.35, p = 0.05). Maximal gasping occurred at 202 +/- 34s from onset of VF and resulted in an average decrease in ICP from 27.4 +/- 5.8 to 20 +/- 6.7 mmHg, p < 0.01 along with an increase in CePP from -0.05 +/- 10.9 to 11.5 +/- 12.6 mmHg, p < 0.05.
   Conclusions: Spontaneous gasping during cardiac arrest decreased intra-cranial pressure and increased cerebral perfusion pressure significantly. These results may help explain why gasping is associated with improved cardiac arrest survival rates. Based upon this new understanding of the physiology of gasping, we speculate that investigation of devices that can enhance the physiological effects of gasping on intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion should be prioritized.

TI COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF SURGICAL DECOMPRESSION AND RESECTION OF
   LOCAL EDEMA IN THE THERAPY OF EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN TRAUMA - INVESTIGATION
   OF ICP, EEG AND CEREBRAL METABOLISM IN CATS
SO CHILDS BRAIN
AB The effect of decompressive trepanation was compared to that of surgical resection of the traumatized tissue in the course of traumatic brain edema in standardized experimental brain trauma. Following a right parietal cold injury, the following parameters were monitored continuously in 12 cats: ventricular pressure, epidural pressure over both hemispheres, arterial and central venous pressure and heart rate. The EEG was evaluated continuously using a computer (power spectra). After catheterization of the superior sagittal sinus, cerebral arteriovenous differences of glucose, lactate, O2 and CO2 were calculated. Animals (6) were treated surgically when showing elevated intracranial pressure [ICP] and markedly altered EEG. In 3 animals, the right hemisphere was decompressed by extensive resection of bone and dura. In 3 further animals, the softened brain tissue of the cold lesion was resected and the skull defect closed. Untreated animals (6) were used as controls. A decompression by skull hemiresection for ablation of the injured cortex abolished the high intracranial pressure, but only the latter method seemed to prevent further damage. This could be demonstrated by the EEG registration, and by the normalization of arteriovenous metabolite differences. Only animals treated with edema resection had a normal arousal reaction and survived the trauma. Only an ablation of the local injury should prevent further damage to the brain. After decompressive trepanation alone, the progression of tissue edema is not interrupted. The poor results obtained, even from extensive decompressive operations in traumatic brain edema, indicate that the further development of edema is independent of the intracranial pressure, whereas the favorable results of resection of lobar contusions show an interruption of the spread of dysbolism.

TI Canine cerebral circulation: a review
SO ACTA VETERINARIA BRNO
AB The cerebral vascular system (CVS) of mammals is a complicated three-dimensional structure that supplies brain parenchyma with oxygenated blood and nutrients, drains deoxygenated blood and catabolites out from it and participates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption, maintenance of intracranial pressure (ICP) stability, and brain thermoregulation. A thorough understanding of the morphology and function of CVS is essential for human as well as veterinary neurologists and neurosurgeons as it helps to diagnose intracranial pathological processes, to choose an optimal therapeutic approach for the specific patient concerning configuration and possible anomalies of their CVS, and to execute intracranial surgical procedures. The number of brain operations in dogs has rapidly grown, which prompted the authors to review the literature on the complex issue of canine intracranial blood vessels. The research strategy involved a PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE using the terms 'canine brain blood vessels' and 'cerebral haemodynamics in dogs' in the English language literature; references from selected papers were also scanned, and relevant articles were included.

TI Monitoring of Patients with Severe Head Injury
SO CESKA A SLOVENSKA NEUROLOGIE A NEUROCHIRURGIE
AB Head injury is defined as severe in patients with a post-resuscitation Glasgow coma scale (GCS) figure of <= 8. Such patients are relatively deeply unconscious and cannot follow instructions. Therefore we need continuously to monitor those parameters that provide us with important information regarding patient condition and brain function. in recent years, the possibility of monitoring certain cerebral and intracranial function parameters has been added to the routine intensive care watch repertoire of pulse oxymetry, blood pressure, body temperature, laboratory monitoring, central venous pressure, fluid balance, end-tidal CO2, etc. Monitoring of neurological status, particularly the level of consciousness (GCS) and the pupils is obvious. In terms of invasive intracranial monitoring it is currently practically mandatory that intracranial pressure (ICP) be monitored, either by means of external ventricular drainage or by intraparenchymal probe. As well as this, we monitor cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Monitoring of brain tissue oxymetry (PtiO(2)) is becoming a standard modality, while microdialysis is also frequent in some departments. CT monitoring is very important to the clinician, particularly in the initial phases after the injury, mainly as an indication for decision-making in certain operative procedures. Individual approaches to multimodal monitoring have to be evaluated in relationship to one another and the patient. Special types of software help us to evaluate the indices of vascular reactivity and this knowledge is currently used to establish the optimal CPP for the individual patient. Monitoring of cerebral physiology should not be purposeless, but should serve for early diagnostics of pathological conditions and at the same time may indicate a correctly performed therapeutical intervention.

TI Intra-abdominal pressure: The neglected variable in selecting the
   ventriculoperitoneal shunt for treating hydrocephalus
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: In the selection of a ventriculoperitoneal cerebrospinal fluid shunt, the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is traditionally neglected as a result of the idea that its value is close to 0 mmHg. Our aim was to explore the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and IAP with the goal of providing clinically relevant data that could help neurosurgeons to estimate IAP and select the appropriate shunt for patients with hydrocephalus and especially those with normal-pressure hydrocephalus syndrome.
   METHODS: Sixty patients requiring the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt were included in the study. We determined weight, BMI, and IAP. IAP was measured through an intraperitoneal catheter during the shunt surgery. To determine whether a linear relationship existed between quantitative variables, linear regression analysis was used.
   RESULTS: BMI was 28.1 +/- 4.8 kg/m(2). Eighteen patients (30%) had normal weight, 21 (35%) were moderately overweight, and 21 (35%) were obese. IAP was related to patient BMI. A significant positive linear correlation was identified between BMI and IAP (r = 0.52; P = 0.018) with a slope of 0.31 (P < 0.001) and an intercept of -5.5.
   CONCLUSION: In our study, we determined that IAP had a strong positive linear relationship with BMI. This correlation was independent of sex. An IAP of 0 mmHg can, therefore, only be assumed for patients with a normal BMI who are recumbent. In obese or overweight patients, neurosurgeons should take IAP into account when selecting both the most adequate differential pressure valve to be implanted and in which distal cavity to place the distal catheter to avoid shunt underdrainage induced by high IAP.

TI Intra-abdominal hypertension: Pulmonary and cerebral complications
SO TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
CT 9th International Meeting on Liver Anesthesia and Intensive Care
CY NOV 29-DEC 01, 2007
CL Modena, ITALY
AB Intra-abdominal hypertension causes many physiologic changes, primarily by reducing thoracic compliance and secondarily causing organ failure, which is the body's normal response to trauma or acute inflammatory response. Compartment syndrome as a cause of abdominal hypertension has adverse effects on the circulation, threatening the function and viability of tissues. Intra-abdominal hypertension with the clinical picture of compartment syndrome is a reperfusion injury that is a cyclic event. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure due to whatever mechanism affects all intra-abdominal viscera, including the abdominal wall. Due to edema reducing thoracic compliance, producing severe encephalopathy and leading to severe ischemia with generation of significant quantities of reactive oxygen free radicals as well peroxidation products released from the intestine, liver and spleen. Elevated intracranial pressure causes encephalopathy and the risk of neuronal damage due to the sharp decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. Elevated intracranial pressure is due to restriction of outflow from the lumbar venous plexus. The etiology of the sudden increase in capillary permeability remains unclear. Decompressive laparotomy leads to a rapid improvement in pulmonary parameters and oxygen delivery. The clinical state after decompression is an example of ischemia-reperfusion injury requiring therapy with inotropes and other agents to improve cardiac, respiratory, renal and cerebral hemodynamics with life saving effects.

TI The Effects of Pressure Gradient on Papilledema Improvement After Venous
   Sinus Stenting in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF ENDOVASCULAR THERAPY
AB Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the pressure gradient on papilledema after stenting in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients and venous sinus stenosis (VSS).Materials and Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we examined 121 patients with IIH and VSS who underwent stenting. The papilledema Frisen grade at the 1-month follow-up was used as a grouping factor (favorable outcome: 0-1; unfavorable outcome: 2-5). We used multivariable logistic regression modeling to determine independent predictors of favorable outcome. The performance of the prediction model was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Results: A total of 96 patients had papilledema grades 0 to 1, and 25 patients had papilledema grades 2 to 5. Patients with the first group had significantly lower gradient pressures preoperatively (15.2 mmHg vs. 21.4 mmHg, p=0.001) and postoperatively (2 mmHg vs. 3.3 mmHg, p=0.002) relative to those in the second group. Multivariate analysis indicated that preoperative pressure gradient (odds ratio [OR] = 1.119; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.034-1.211]) and postoperative pressure gradient (OR = 1.498; 95% CI = 1.147-1.957) were independent predictors of favorable outcome. In the ROC analysis, the cut-off pressure gradient for the highest sensitivity (0.44) and specificity (0.874) was 22.75 mmHg, with a Youden's index of 0.314. Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with a preoperative pressure gradient <22.75 mmHg had more rapid improvement of papilledema than did those with a pressure gradient >22.75 mmHg (mean+SD: 2.639+0.382 [95% CI: 1.890-3.388] versus mean+SD: 3.882+0.884 [95% CI: 2.149-5.616]; p=0.004).Conclusion: A significant reduction in the pressure gradient appears to be strongly correlated with the success of VSS in patients with IIH. A higher preoperative pressure gradient may reduce stenting efficacy in patients with IIH.

TI The secondary abdominal compartment syndrome: not just another
   post-traumatic complication
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB The secondary abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as the presence of organ dysfunction with concurrent intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) in a scenario lacking primary intraperitoneal injury or intervention. This state appears to be related to visceral, abdominal wall and retroperitoneal edema and ascites induced by resuscitation. Despite a diverse range of associated causes such as pancreatitis, intra-abdominal sepsis, cardiac arrest, thermal injury and extraperitoneal trauma, this class of ACS is characterized by the presence of shock requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation. Secondary ACS is an extreme condition along a continuum of raised intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) that is pathoneumonic when associated with new overt organ failure. When IAP is above normal but is not associated with organ failure, IAH is diagnosed. Because these conditions are common among critically ill patients, the measurement of IAP is crucial. It is unclear whether preventing IAH reduces progression to ACS or influences outcomes. When overt ACS is confirmed, immediate surgical decompression of the patient's abdomen via a standard laparotomy is usually required. Because many disease processes resulting in critical illness require aggressive fluid resuscitation as a primary therapy, it is likely that secondary ACS is much more common than previously believed. Further study is needed.

TI A comparative analysis of the effects of sevoflurane and propofol on
   cerebral oxygenation during steep Trendelenburg position and
   pneumoperitoneum for robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy
SO JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA
AB Steep Trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum during robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and may alter cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygenation. Volatile anesthetics and propofol have different effects on ICP, CBF, and cerebral metabolic rate and may have different impact on cerebral oxygenation during RALP. In this study, we measured jugular venous bulb oxygenation (SjO(2)) and regional oxygen saturation (SctO(2)) in patients undergoing RALP to evaluate cerebral oxygenation and compared the effects of sevoflurane and propofol. We also verified whether SctO(2) may be an alternative to SjO(2).
   Fifty patients scheduled for RALP were randomly assigned to undergo sevoflurane (group S) or propofol (group P) anesthesia. SjO(2), SctO(2), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), central venous pressure (CVP), partial pressures of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), Bispectral Index (BIS) and nasopharyngeal temperature (BT) were recorded 5 min before surgery commencement, 5 min after pneumoperitoneum, 5, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after pneumoperitoneum in a Trendelenburg position, and after desufflation in a supine position.
   SjO(2) was significantly higher in group S than in group P at all measurement points [group S vs. group P: 77 % (11) vs. 65 % (13), mean of all measurement points (1SD); p < 0.01]. Linear regression analysis (beta = 0.106; r (2) = 0.065; p = 0.004) shows a weak relationship between SjO(2) and SctO(2).
   Sevoflurane maintains higher SjO(2) levels than propofol during RALP. SctO(2) does not accurately reflect SjO(2).

AB Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was first introduced into hospitals in the 1960s, initially into critical care, as bedside monitors, and eventually into step-down units with telemetry capabilities. Although the initial use was rather simplistic (ie, heart rate and rhythm assessment), the capabilities of these devices and associated physiologic (vital sign) monitors have expanded considerably. Current bedside monitors now include sophisticated ECG software designed to identify myocardial ischemia (ie, ST-segment monitoring), QT-interval prolongation, and a myriad of other cardiac arrhythmia types. Physiologic monitoring has had similar advances from noninvasive assessment of core vital signs (blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) to invasive monitoring including arterial blood pressure, temperature, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, carbon dioxide, and many others. The benefit of these monitoring devices is that continuous and real-time information is displayed and can be configured to alarm to alert nurses to a change in a patient's condition. I think it is fair to say that critical and high-acuity care nurses see these devices as having a positive impact in patient care. However, this enthusiasm has been somewhat dampened in the past decade by research highlighting the shortcomings and unanticipated consequences of these devices, namely alarm and alert fatigue. In this article, which is associated with the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses' Distinguished Research Lecture, I describe my 36-year journey from a clinical nurse to nurse scientist and the trajectory of my program of research focused primarily on ECG and physiologic monitoring. Specifically, I discuss the good, the not so good, and the untapped potential of these monitoring systems in clinical care. I also describe my experiences with community-based research in patients with acute coronary syndrome and/or heart failure. ( American Journal of Critical Care. 2024;33:247-259)

TI Hemodynamic improvement of a LUCAS 2 automated device by addition of an
   impedance threshold device in a pig model of cardiac arrest
SO RESUSCITATION
AB Introduction: The combination of the LUCAS 2 (L-CPR) automated CPR device and an impedance threshold device (ITD) has been widely implemented in the clinical field. This animal study tested the hypothesis that the addition of an ITD on L-CPR would enhance cerebral and coronary perfusion pressures.
   Methods: Ten female pigs (39.0 +/- 2.0 kg) were sedated, intubated, anesthetized with isofluorane, and paralyzed with succinylcholine (93.3 mu g/kg/min) to inhibit the potential confounding effect of gasping. After 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation, 4 min of L-CPR + an active ITD or L-CPR + a sham ITD was initiated and followed by another 4 min of the alternative method of CPR. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), diastolic right atrial pressure (RAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), airway pressure, and end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) were recorded continuously. Data expressed as mean mmHg +/- SD.
   Results: Decompression phase airway pressure was significantly lower with L-CPR + active ITD versus L-CPR + sham ITD (-5.3 +/- 2.2 vs. -0.5 +/- 0.6; p < 0.001). L-CPR + active ITD treatment resulted in significantly improved hemodynamics versus L-CPR + sham ITD: ETCO2, 35 +/- 6 vs. 29 +/- 7 (p = 0.015); SBP, 99 +/- 9 vs. 93 +/- 15 (p = 0.050); DBP, 24 +/- 12 vs. 19 +/- 15 (p = 0.006); coronary perfusion pressure, 29 +/- 8 vs. 26 +/- 7 (p = 0.004) and cerebral perfusion pressure, 24 +/- 13 vs. 21 +/- 12 (p = 0.028).
   Conclusions: In pigs undergoing L-CPR the addition of the active ITD significantly reduced intrathoracic pressure and increased vital organ perfusion pressures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Resolution of syndromic craniosynostosis-associated Chiari malformation
   Type I without suboccipital decompression after posterior cranial vault
   release Case report
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is associated with syndromic and nonsyndromic craniosynostosis in pediatric patients, and the surgical management of CM-I in such cases is controversial. Previous guidelines have recommended simultaneous cranial vault expansion and suboccipital decompression. However, spontaneous resolution of CM-I has been observed, and the combined procedure carries additional surgical risks. The authors report the case of a 6-month-old boy with Crouzon syndrome, CM-I, and a cervical syrinx who underwent posterior cranial vault release without suboccipital decompression. Imaging at the 3-month follow-up visit demonstrated complete resolution of the CM-I, improvement in CSF flow, and reduction in the size of the syrinx. This case suggests that up-front suboccipital decompression may not be necessary in patients with craniosynostosis and CM-I. A strategy of initial cranial vault release, followed by watchful waiting and radiographic surveillance, is proposed. (http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2011.11.PEDS11268)

TI Management of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
SO NEUROSURGERY QUARTERLY
AB Neurosurgeons are often involved in the care of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Medical management of CVST includes appropriate diagnostic imaging studies, evaluation for potentially treatable causes of thrombosis, and control of increased intracranial pressure with medications and cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Seizure prophylaxis is indicated in the acute phase of disease and should be continued indefinitely in selected patients. Systemic anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin is the mainstay of medical treatment of CVST; anticoagulation is safe and effective even in the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients who deteriorate neurologically despite appropriate medical treatment are candidates for endovascular treatment. Endovascular interventions include infusion of thrombolytic agents directly into the thrombosed sinus and mechanical thrombectomy with balloons or rheolytic catheters. These interventions are effective and generally safe, although local thrombolytic infusions increase the risk of new or worsened intracranial hemorrhages. Chronic CVST with stenosis of the venous sinuses may be treated with balloon angioplasty and stenting. Under rare circumstances, open surgical interventions may be considered, including open thrombectomy and decompressive craniectomy. Neurosurgeons should also be prepared to treat late complications of CVST, including pseudotumor cerebri and dural arteriovenous fistulas. In summary, CVST is a serious but treatable disease, and effective medical, endovascular, and open surgical therapies exist.

AB The substances generally employed for osmotherapy and oncotherapy (mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol, albumin, dextran) have different pharmacological actions. They should also have different effects on raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and on the altered neuronal activity that can be demonstrated by the EEG. The ventricular pressure (VP), the epidural pressure over the lesion (rEP), and the epidural pressure over the contralateral hemisphere (lEP) were measured before and after the infliction of standardized cold lesions in 24 cats. The arterial pressure (aP) and the central venous pressure were also recorded. The EEG and the intracranial pressure were compared continuously. Marked rises of ventricular pressure (30-40 mm Hg) were treated with i.v. infusions. The serum osmolality was measured. The ICP rises quickly after trauma. The epidural pressure over the lesion (rEP) increases sharply, with a pressure difference over the VP of up to 80 mm. The lEP also rises more steeply than the VP. The EEG power falls after trauma, and this fall is particularly rapid over the right cerebral hemisphere. Only over the undamaged hemisphere does the EEG activity recover after trauma. Later it again becomes reduced with the rising ICP. Mannitol (20%) or 10% glycerol (of approximately equal osmolality) reduce VP and lEP by about 50%, while rEP remains raised. Thirty minutes after the infusion the ICP again rises. Mannitol (40%) or mannisorb (15% mannitol, 30% sorbitol) causes the ICP to become normal without the pressure differences, and the pressure remains low for 1-2 h. With this osmotherapy the EEG activity is significantly improved only over the left hemisphere. In parallel with the improvement there is a rise in aP. After the infusion the EEG quickly deteriorates, and the aP falls despite a normal ICP. Infusion with 20% albumin or 10% dextran 40 (oncotherapy) is accompanied by a rise in aP and a fast ascent of ICP in the right hemisphere. EEG power falls at the same time and only partially recovers after the infusion. The possibility of using solutions of high osmolality in the treatment of brain edema was discussed. Oncotherapy must be preceded by a lowering of ICP. The technique of recording the epidural pressure and the EEG activity is only slightly invasive in character, and is suitable for patient monitoring.

TI Comparison of extraperitoneal and intraperitoneal laparoscopic
   procedures for intracranial pressure increase: a prospective clinical
   study
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB - OBJECTIVE: According to the literature, higher levels of both intracranial pres-sure (ICP) and intraabdominal pressure (IAP) are related in a way that suggests a causal relation-ship. An increase in ICP can cause major neuro-logical problems both during and after laparo-scopic surgery. In this study, we aimed to exam-ine the increase in ICP between totally extraper-itoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair and laparo-scopic cholecystectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 52 individuals who underwent laparoscopic sur-gery for the treatment of inguinal hernia (n = 26) or had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 26). The optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) was as-sessed before the procedure (T0), 10 minutes af-ter carbon dioxide insufflation (T1), and immedi-ately before extubation (T2). RESULTS: There were significant differences in the ONSD values between the two groups as a function of time (p = 0.001). In terms of ONSD, the laparoscopic cholecystectomy value (LV) group showed a greater shift from T0 to T1 and T2 than the inguinal hernia value (HV) group. At T1, the ONSD values of both groups were con-siderably higher than those of T0 and T2. The impact of the extraperitoneal and transperitone-al laparoscopic methods on ICP was investigat-ed. The ONSD value reached its maximum at T1 in both groups. At all measurement periods, the ONSD values of the LV group were noticeably higher than those of the HV group. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of ONSD ultrasonography is an important ap-proach for determining the ICP level. During the decision-making process of TEP inguinal hernia repair, this study can guide medical profession-als in the evaluation of elevated ICP.

TI Severe head injury in the United Kingdom and Ireland: A survey of
   practice and implications for management
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: To study the current intensive care management of patients with severe head injury (defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than or equal to 8) in neurosurgical referral centers in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland.
   Data Collection: A questionnaire was sent to the directors of the 44 neurosurgical referral units identified from the UK Medical Directory. After 4 wks, a copy of the questionnaire was sent to all nonresponders, with a cover letter urging them to respond. The aim was to collect data regarding the characteristics of the intensive care units (ICU), sedation, monitoring modalities used, the treatment of intracranial hypertension, and general care of severely head-injured patients.
   Data Extraction: Forty completed questionnaires were returned. Only 35 (88%) centers provided care for the severely head-injured as defined in the questionnaire. Patients were managed in specialized neurosurgical ICUs in 66% of centers and in general ICUs in the remainder of the centers. The ICUs were coordinated by an anesthesiologist in 66% of instances and by a neurosurgeon in 23%. The mean number of beds per units was 7.9 (range 4 to 16), with 1:1 nurse/bed ratio and 5.5 nurses per bed (total number of nursing staff per bed) (range 2.75 to 8). Annual caseload varied between units with the majority of units (49%) receiving between 25 and 50 patients with severe head injury, 23% receiving between 50 and 100 patients with severe head injury, and 29% receiving >100 patients with severe head injury.
   There was considerable variability in both the nature of monitoring and therapy between centers. Although blood and central venous pressures were invasively monitored in >50% of the patients in 94% and 77% of the centers, respectively, intracranial pressure was only monitored routinely in 57% of the centers. Jugular venous bulb oximetry, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, electroencephalography, and near-infrared spectroscopy were rarely used.
   Nearly all centers used propofol and midazolam for sedation, with morphine, fentanyl, and alfentanil as the main analgesics. Muscle relaxation was commonly used, with 40% of the centers employing it in 100% of their patients. Atracurium and vecuronium were the most commonly used agents.
   Only 68% of the centers had a protocol for the treatment of intracranial hypertension. Although hyperventilation to a PaCO2 of 26 to 30 torr (3.5 to 4.0 kPa) was the norm in the majority of centers (56%), two centers aimed for PaCO2 values (26 torr ((3.5 kPa). A quarter of the units did not aim for a cerebral perfusion pressure of >60 mm Hg. Mild hypothermia was rarely used and 14% of the centers continued to use corticosteroids for the treatment of intracranial hypertension as a result of head trauma.
   Conclusion: We conclude that there are wide variations in the management of the severely head injured patient in the UK and Ireland. Some of the therapies employed are not supported by available research findings. Rationalization (using rational management, i.e., based on good evidence) of the intensive care management of severe head injury with the development of widely accepted guidelines may result in an improvement in the quality of care of the head-injured patient.

TI HOSPITAL-BASED ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC MONITORING: THE GOOD, THE NOT SO
   GOOD, AND UNTAPPED POTENTIAL
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was first introduced into hospitals in the 1960s, initially into critical care, as bedside monitors, and eventually into step-down units with telemetry capabilities. Although the initial use was rather simplistic (ie, heart rate and rhythm assessment), the capabilities of these devices and associated physiologic (vital sign) monitors have expanded considerably. Current bedside monitors now include sophisticated ECG software designed to identify myocardial ischemia (ie, ST-segment monitoring), QT-interval prolongation, and a myriad of other cardiac arrhythmia types. Physiologic monitoring has had similar advances from noninvasive assessment of core vital signs (blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) to invasive monitoring including arterial blood pressure, temperature, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, carbon dioxide, and many others. The benefit of these monitoring devices is that continuous and real-time information is displayed and can be configured to alarm to alert nurses to a change in a patient's condition. I think it is fair to say that critical and high-acuity care nurses see these devices as having a positive impact in patient care. However, this enthusiasm has been somewhat dampened in the past decade by research highlighting the shortcomings and unanticipated consequences of these devices, namely alarm and alert fatigue. In this article, which is associated with the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses' Distinguished Research Lecture, I describe my 36-year journey from a clinical nurse to nurse scientist and the trajectory of my program of research focused primarily on ECG and physiologic monitoring. Specifically, I discuss the good, the not so good, and the untapped potential of these monitoring systems in clinical care. I also describe my experiences with community-based research in patients with acute coronary syndrome and/or heart failure.

TI Mechanical countermeasures to headward fluid shifts
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Head-to-foot gravitationally induced hydrostatic pressure gradients in the upright posture on Earth are absent in weightlessness. This results in a relative headward fluid shift in the vascular and cerebrospinal fluid compartments and may underlie multiple physiological consequences of spaceflight, including the spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome. Here, we tested three mechanical countermeasures [lower body negative pressure (LBNP), venoconstrictive thigh cuffs (VTC), and impedance threshold device (ITD) resistive inspiratory breathing] individually and in combination to reduce a posture-induced headward fluid shift as a ground-based spaceflight analog. Ten healthy subjects (5 male) underwent baseline measures (seated and supine postures) followed by countermeasure exposure in the supine posture. Noninvasive measurements included ultrasound [internal jugular veins (IJV) cross-sectional area, cardiac stroke volume, optic nerve sheath diameter, noninvasive IN pressure], transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (OAE; intracranial pressure index), intraocular pressure, choroidal thickness from optical coherence tomography imaging, and brachial blood pressure. Compared with the supine posture, IJV area decreased 48% with application of LBNP [mean ratio: 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-0.60, P < 0.001], 31% with VTC (mean ratio: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55-0.87, P < 0.001), and 56% with ITD (mean ratio: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.12-1.70, P = 0.46), measured at end-inspiration. LBNP was the only individual countermeasure to decrease the OAE phase angle (Delta -12.9 degrees, 95% CI: -25 to -0.9, P = 0.027), and use of combined countermeasures did not result in greater effects. Thus, LBNP, and to a lesser extent VTC and ITD, represents promising headward fluid shift countermeasures but will require future testing in analog and spaceflight environments.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY As a weightlessness-induced headward fluid shift is hypothesized to be a primary factor underlying several physiological consequences of spaceflight, countermeasures aimed at reversing the fluid shift will likely be crucial during exploration-class spaceflight missions. Here, we tested three mechanical countermeasures individually and in various combinations to reduce a posture-induced headward fluid shift as a ground-based spaceflight analog.

TI Apert syndrome: the Paris and Rotterdam philosophy
SO EXPERT OPINION ON ORPHAN DRUGS
AB Introduction: Apert syndrome is a rare type of syndromic craniosynostosis. Patients have an explicit phenotype with craniofacial dysmorphologies and severe symmetrical syndactyly of the hands and feet. This review includes background information about the syndrome and several aspects of the treatment.
   Areas covered: The cause of Apert syndrome is found in unique mutations in the Fibroblast Growth Factors Receptor (FGFR) 2 gene in 99%. It results in cranial suture fusion, craniofacial dysmorphologies and severe symmetrical syndactyly of the hands and feet. Patients with Apert syndrome are at risk for mental retardation, mobility impairment and intracranial hypertension (ICHT). This is the result of a complex interaction between (1) abnormal skull growth, (2) ventriculomegaly, (3) venous outflow obstruction and (4) obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Mental retardation is mainly determined by the FGFR2 mutation and treatment is directed at protecting the intrinsic potential of neurocognition.
   Expert Opinion: To prevent ICHT, we prefer an occipital expansion in the first year of life. Screening on ICHT and its underlying causes is necessary at least until the age of ten by means of skull circumference measurements, fundoscopy, optical coherence tomography, MRI and polysomnography. Multicentre studies on long-term outcome are required to validate the rationale of different clinical protocols.

TI A systematic review of surgical and interventional radiology procedures
   for pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
AB Background Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is defined as elevated intracranial pressure and consequent symptoms (mainly headache and visual deterioration) occurring in the absence of secondary causes. Surgical and interventional radiology procedures should be considered for refractory IIH and mainly include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion techniques, optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF), and venous sinus stenting (VSS). Our study aims to review the current literature on the application of these techniques in clinical practice. Methods A systematic literature review on the surgical and interventional radiology treatment of IIH was conducted, focusing on ONSF, VSS, and CSF diversion techniques. According to PRISMA guidelines, all reports published in PubMed in the last 30 years (1993-2023) were considered, and among 722 papers, 48 were included in the present study, resulting in a total study population of 454 children or adolescents (11 months-17 years old). Results Among 454 patients, 193 underwent an invasive approach, divided into CSF diversion (115/193), ONSF (65/193), VSS (11/193), cranial subtemporal decompression (8/193), and internal cranial expansion (9/193). Sixteen of the 193 patients (8%) required reintervention due to relapsing symptoms or surgical complications, particularly those who underwent CSF diversion. Furthermore, 9/115 required shunt revision due to shunt obstruction or malfunction. We extracted data on the outcome of each procedure: of the 193 patients, 71 experienced a positive outcome with symptom resolution or improvement, while 27 demonstrated a negative outcome. Discussion and conclusions Severe and refractory cases of IIH are eligible for invasive treatments. CSF diversion is the most frequently used technique, despite its high failure risk and need for reintervention. ONSF has shown good results in terms of outcome and safety, particularly in children with visual symptoms. VSS is the most recent approach, indicated in children with stenosis of the venous sinus. In our study population, VSS demonstrated good results in terms of symptom resolution and need for reintervention, but its use remains limited to a few centers.

TI Non-Invasive Respiratory Impedance Enhances Cerebral Perfusion in
   Healthy Adults
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Optimization of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is the cornerstone of clinical management in a number of neurologic diseases, most notably ischemic stroke. Intrathoracic pressure influences cardiac output and has the potential to impact CBF. Here, we aim to quantify cerebral hemodynamic changes in response to increased respiratory impedance (RI) using a non-invasive respiratory device. We measured cerebral perfusion under varying levels of RI (6 cm H2O, 9 cm H2O, and 12 cm H2O) in 20 healthy volunteers. Simultaneous measurements of microvascular CBF and middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity (MFV), respectively, were performed with optical diffuse correlation spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler ultrasound. At a high level of RI, MFV increased by 6.4% compared to baseline (p = 0.004), but changes in cortical CBF were non-significant. In a multivariable linear regression model accounting for end-tidal CO2, RI was associated with increases in both MFV (coefficient: 0.49, p < 0.001) and cortical CBF (coefficient: 0.13, p < 0.001), although the magnitude of the effect was small. Manipulating intrathoracic pressure via non-invasive RI was well tolerated and produced a small but measurable increase in cerebral perfusion in healthy individuals. Future studies in acute ischemic stroke patients with impaired cerebral autoregulation are warranted in order to assess whether RI is feasible as a novel non-invasive therapy for stroke.

TI Efficacy of dural venous sinus stenting in treating idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension with acute vision loss
SO NEURORADIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Introduction: Dural venous sinus stenting (VSS) is an effective, durable treatment for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) due to underlying venous sinus stenosis. However, the use of venous sinus stenting to treat IIH with acute vision loss has rarely been described.
   Methods: A retrospective chart analysis identified patients who received VSS for fulminant IIH, defined as acute (< 8 weeks) visual field loss to within the central degrees and/or a decrease in visual acuity to less than or equal to 20/50 in either eye in the presence of papilledema.
   Results: Ten patients were identified with average patient age of 31.0 years, and all except one were female. Mean body mass index was 41.2 kg/m(2). All patients presented with vision loss and some with headache and tinnitus. The average trans-stenotic gradient pre-stenting was 28.7 mmHg (range 9-62 mmHg). All patients had diminished or resolved venous gradients immediately following the procedure. At mean follow-up of 60.5 weeks, 100% had improvements in papilledema, 80.0% had subjective vision improvement, 55.6% had headache improvement and 87.5% had tinnitus improvement. 90.0% had stable or improved visual acuity in both eyes with a mean post-stenting Snellen acuity of 20/30 and an average gain of 3 lines Snellen acuity post-stenting (95% confidence intervals 0.1185-0.4286, p = 0.0018). Two patients (20.0%) required further surgical treatment (cerebrospinal shunting and/or stenting) after their first stenting procedure.
   Conclusions: This series suggests that VSS is feasible in patients presenting with IIH and acute vision loss with a fairly low complication rate and satisfactory clinical outcomes.

TI Transarterial Onyx Embolization of Bilateral Transverse-Sigmoid Dural
   Arteriovenous Malformation with Transvenous Balloon Assist-Initial US
   Experience with Copernic RC Venous Remodeling Balloon
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Currently, the mainstay treatment of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) involves endovascular approaches, especially for high-grade lesions. Transarterial embolization with preservation of venous sinuses has become the preferred approach due to the development of newer liquid embolic agents. For further precision during embolization, the use of temporary balloon occlusion to protect the patency of dural sinuses from the embolic agent's migration has been described.
   METHODS: A 64-year-old man presented with bilateral pulsatile tinnitus and visual decline. A diagnostic cerebral angiogram demonstrated a complex bilateral Borden type II and Cognard type IIB DAVF. Treatment was carried out endovascularly under general anesthesia in a staged fashion. In the first stage, the balloon was inflated during embolization to protect the right transverse sigmoid venous sinus system and torcula. In the second stage, the balloon was again inflated to protect the left transverse sigmoid venous sinus system and torcula during embolization. Complete obliteration of the left DAVF was achieved, and patency of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses was preserved. Patency of the right transverse and sigmoid sinus was also conserved post procedure.
   RESULTS: The patient was treated successfully with transarterial Onyx embolization with transvenous balloon protection of the sinus.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case is the first reported use of the Copernic RC balloon in the United States under the compassionate use guidelines of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The use of this balloon is becoming a useful treatment alternative in selected cases of DAVFs as it improves the safety and efficacy of transarterial embolization as evidenced in this case.

TI Intracranial pressure modulates aqueous humour dynamics of the eye
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON
AB Key points
   An elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP) lowers conventional outflow facility (increases aqueous outflow resistance) of rat eyes. The reduction in outflow facility correlates with an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). The effect of ICP elevation on outflow facility and IOP is blocked by TTX. The results indicate that aqueous humour dynamics is modulated by ICP-driven neural feedback from the brain. This feedback mechanism may act to stabilize translaminar pressure across the optic nerve head and may provide a new avenue for glaucoma therapy. While intraocular pressure (IOP) is a well-known risk factor for glaucoma, intracranial pressure (ICP) is attracting heightened interest because of its influence on optic nerve head biomechanics. Studies have shown that ICP can have marked impacts on posterior eye health by modifying the translaminar pressure gradient across the optic nerve. There is also growing evidence that IOP and ICP may be interconnected, although the mechanism of their putative interaction is unknown. We sought to test the hypothesis that ICP modulates IOP by altering aqueous humour dynamics. The anterior chamber and lateral ventricle of anaesthetized Brown-Norway rats were cannulated with fine-gauge needles connected to a programmable pump and saline reservoir, respectively. ICP was manipulated by varying reservoir height, and eye outflow facility (C) was determined from the pump flow rate required to hold IOP at different levels. C was 22 +/- 4 nl/min/mmHg at resting ICP and 13 +/- 3 nl/min/mmHg when ICP was raised 15 mmHg, a reduction of 41 +/- 13% (n = 18). The decrease in outflow facility was independent of blood pressure, reversible, scaled with ICP elevation and correlated with increases in resting IOP. It was physiological in origin because C returned to baseline values after the rats were killed and corneal application of TTX though ICP remained elevated. These results indicate that a neural feedback mechanism driven by ICP regulates conventional outflow facility in rats. The mechanism may protect the eye from translaminar pressure swings and may offer a new target for glaucoma treatment.

TI High Versus Low Volume Fluid Resuscitation Strategies in a Porcine Model
   (Sus scrofa) of Combined Thermal and Traumatic Brain Injury
SO SHOCK
AB Background: Combined burn and traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment priorities may not align due to opposing fluid resuscitation paradigms used in treating burns and TBI. We developed a porcine model of combined thermal injury/TBI and compared an "aggressive" fluid resuscitation strategy using the Parkland formula and a "restrictive" resuscitation strategy using the modified Brooke formula. Methods: Twenty-eight swine were deeply anesthetized and received a 40% total body surface area full-thickness burn injury and TBI. Swine were then randomized to receive restrictive or aggressive resuscitation for 8 h after which time animals were euthanized and necropsy was performed. Volume of brain injury was assessed after analyzing segmental slices of brain tissue. Results: There were no differences between the restrictive and aggressive resuscitation groups in blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, intra-cranial pressure (ICP), or serum lactate levels after 8 h of resuscitation. Urine output was higher in the aggressive resuscitation group. The restrictive group had a significantly higher serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) compared with baseline and compared with the aggressive group. There was no significant difference in size of brain injury between groups. Conclusions: Both restrictive and aggressive resuscitation demonstrated adequate resuscitation at 8 h postinjury. Increased serum BUN in the restrictive group may be an indicator of early acute kidney injury, despite adequate urine output. Resuscitation strategy did not appear to affect ICP or the size of brain injury.

TI Lumped parameter simulations of cervical lymphatic vessels: dynamics of
   murine cerebrospinal fluid efflux from the skull
SO FLUIDS AND BARRIERS OF THE CNS
AB BackgroundGrowing evidence suggests that for rodents, a substantial fraction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drains by crossing the cribriform plate into the nasopharyngeal lymphatics, eventually reaching the cervical lymphatic vessels (CLVs). Disruption of this drainage pathway is associated with various neurological disorders.MethodsWe employ a lumped parameter method to numerically model CSF drainage across the cribriform plate to CLVs. Our model uses intracranial pressure as an inlet pressure and central venous blood pressure as an outlet pressure. The model incorporates initial lymphatic vessels (modeling those in the nasal region) that absorb the CSF and collecting lymphatic vessels (modeling CLVs) to transport the CSF against an adverse pressure gradient. To determine unknown parameters such as wall stiffness and valve properties, we utilize a Monte Carlo approach and validate our simulation against recent in vivo experimental measurements.ResultsOur parameter analysis reveals the physical characteristics of CLVs. Our results suggest that the stiffness of the vessel wall and the closing state of the valve are crucial for maintaining the vessel size and volume flow rate observed in vivo. We find that a decreased contraction amplitude and frequency leads to a reduction in volume flow rate, and we test the effects of varying the different pressures acting on the CLVs. Finally, we provide evidence that branching of initial lymphatic vessels may deviate from Murray's law to reduce sensitivity to elevated intracranial pressure.ConclusionsThis is the first numerical study of CSF drainage through CLVs. Our comprehensive parameter analysis offers guidance for future numerical modeling of CLVs. This study also provides a foundation for understanding physiology of CSF drainage, helping guide future experimental studies aimed at identifying causal mechanisms of reduction in CLV transport and potential therapeutic approaches to enhance flow.

TI POSTERIOR-FOSSA DURAL ARTERIOVENOUS-MALFORMATIONS AND LATERAL SINUS
   THROMBOSIS - REPORT OF 2 CASES WITH DISCUSSION OF THEIR RELATIONS AND OF
   THEIR TREATMENT
SO NEUROCHIRURGIE
AB Two cases of a posterior fossa dural arteriovenous malformation associated with a lateral sinus thrombosis are reported. In the first case, a right tentorial meningiomas develops at the end of the superior sagittal sinus and on the tranverse sinus which are occluded. A cranial bruit, heard by the patient four months after the surgical removal of the tumour, brings up a dural fistula supplied by the occipital, middle meningeal and pharyngeal arteries and drained away by cervical and cortical  veins. Many attempts of extirpation and radiological embolizaion stop the bruit. In the second case, an increased intracranial pressure mixes up with an aphasia. A continuous emission doppler examination and a CT scan make likely a dural fistula. The malformation, which is associated to a left sigmoid sinus thrombosis, is fed by the occipital and middle meningeal arteries and drained by cortical veins to the cavernous sinus. The occipital artery ligation and a by-pass between the lateral sinus and the internal jugular vein cure the patient with a very good patency of the venous graft that holds up two years after. A few cases of the literature show the succession of the two vascular lesions and prove the primitive occurrence, either of the sinus occlusion, or of the dural fistula. A venous thrombosis might cause a fistula by the opening of physiological shunts of the dura-mater which consequently deviates the blood into the cortical veins, brings down the increased intracranial  pressure and stops the thrombosis to spread. A fistula might also induce the occlusion of the adjacent sinus by alteration of venous return, stasis, parietal lesions, compression and progressive thrombosis. In the first case, the occlusion of the lateral sinus which is related to the meningioma causes with delay a fistula, but its iatrogenic postchirurgical nature must be discussed. In the absence of an increased intracranial pressure, the treatment concerns first at all the arteriovenous  fistula. Its radiological embolization is the best technics. If an increased intracranial pressure is present, the treatment is sometimes palliative by lombo-peritoneal derivation. The etiological treatment is best done by by-pass with venous graft between the internal jugular vein and the lateral sinus above the thrombosis.

TI Dural sinus narrowing in patients with spontaneous anterior skull base
   cerebrospinal fluid leak
SO LARYNGOSCOPE INVESTIGATIVE OTOLARYNGOLOGY
AB Objectives: Current evidence suggests a link between idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (sCSF) leak, as well as between IIH and dural venous sinus (DVS) narrowing. However, there are limited data linking DVS narrowing and sCSF leak. This study aims to determine the prevalence of DVS narrowing in patients with sCSF leak.Methods: A retrospective review of all patients with sCSF leak that presented to a tertiary academic center from 2008 to 2019. Preoperative imaging was independently reviewed by two neuroradiologists to evaluate for DVS narrowing. Available literature was used to estimate the prevalence of DVS narrowing in the general population to allow for comparison. Data were analyzed using Exact binomial test.Results: Analysis of 25 patients with appropriate imaging revealed the majority were women (21/25, 84%) with a mean age of 51.89 years (SD 13.96). The majority of these patients were found to have narrowing of the DVS (20/25, 80%). In patient with sCSF leaks, there was a significantly higher proportion of patients with DVS narrowing compared with published literature examining this condition in the general population (80% vs. 40%, CI 0.59-0.93, p < .001).Conclusion: The prevalence of DVS narrowing in patients with sCSF leaks is substantial and likely greater than the general population. Moreover, there appears to be narrowing in most patients with sCSF leak. Preoperative radiological evaluation of the DVS using MR venography may be useful in patients with sCSF leaks as DVS stenosis may be an underdiagnosed etiology. Further study is needed to evaluate this.

TI Thalamic cavernous malformations
SO SURGICAL NEUROLOGY
AB BACKGROUND
   Only few anecdotal reports and small series of thalamic cavernous malformations have been reported. It follows that the clinical behavior and management are poorly understood; in particular, experiences with the surgical treatment of these lesions are scarce.
   METHODS
   The clinical course, treatment, and outcome of 12 patients (10 females and 2 males, mean age 36 years) with symptomatic cavernous malformations of the thalamus are reviewed. Eight patients (66%) presented with cerebral hemorrhage, one with progressive neurological deficit and three with hydrocephalus/increased intracranial pressure; associated venous anomalies were found in three cases. Treatment consisted of radical surgery in four cases with progressive neurological decline or recurrent disabling hemorrhage, radiosurgery (one case), evacuation of a chronic satellite hematoma (one case), ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus (one case) and observation (five cases). Operative treatment in four cases included transcallosal, trigonal, and occipital interhemispheric approaches.
   RESULTS
   In the surgical group, one patient died, two improved after operation, and one remained the same, Of the patients not operated on radically, one had recurrent hemorrhage 4 months after radiosurgery, one remains stable 8 years after ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and one 3 years after aspiration of a satellite hematoma. Five other patients presenting with thalamic hemorrhage were treated conservatively; recurrent hemorrhage occurred in two cases at 1 month and at 2 years, leaving a mild residual deficit in both cases. Overall, rehemorrhage occurred in four cases (50%) at a mean interval of 18 months after the first bleeding; the annual hemorrhage rate was 6.1%.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Thalamic malformations are more likely to be symptomatic from small hemorrhages compared with lesions in the cerebral hemispheres; progressive growth may also occur with third ventricle invasion or caudal extension to the midbrain. Their high-risk location deters heavy-handed management, but they should not be left long untreated. Both surgery and radiosurgery have been used in the management of thalamic cavernomas reported in the literature. Definite surgical indications include progressive neurological decline and recurrent hemorrhages of malformations abutting the ventricular surface or the posterior incisural space; the complex anatomy of the deep venous system and the association with unexpected venous anomalies complicates the removal of these lesions.

TI Superior sagittal sinus occlusion caused by a compound depressed skull
   fracture: A case treated by emergency surgery
SO NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY
AB Depressed skull fractures compressing major venous sinuses are rare, and the treatment is a matter of controversy. The majority of depressed fractures are treated conservatively for fear of bleeding from venous sinuses, but surgical intervention was conducted in a few cases. We report a case of a 59-year-old man with a compound depressed fracture occluding the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). The patient was struck on the head by a heavy iron bar and admitted to our emergency center because of deterioration of consciousness. A computed tomographic scan showed depressed skull fracture overlying the SSS with hemorrhagic lesions in the bilateral parietal lobes and an acute epidural hematoma at the right temporoparietal convexity. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed an occlusion of the SSS and compensatory venous drainage associated with poor capillary filling in the left parietal lobe. On an emergency basis, bone fragments compressing the SSS were surgically removed piece-by-piece to resolve severe venous congestion and to avoid infection. A small tear in the SSS was treated by head elevation and compressing the SSS with Gelfoam. Postoperative DSA confirmed the patency of the SSS and normal blood flow in the left parietal lobe. The patient exhibited slight disorientation and was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation. Because of symptomatic severe venous congestion, we had to perform emergency surgical decompression and removal of bone fragments. Treatment strategy for depressed skull fracture with SSS involvement was discussed with review of the literature.

TI Factors affecting visual outcomes after dural venous sinus stenting in
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Objectives This study aimed to identify factors at baseline associated with visual outcomes of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with venous sinus stenosis who underwent venous sinus stenting.Methods The study eyes were divided into two groups according to mean deviation (MD) at 6-month post-stenting follow-up: MD better than -2.0 dB (the favorable visual outcome group) and equal to -2.0 or worse (the poorer visual outcome group). Variables at baseline between the two groups were compared. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to identify the factors at baseline associated with poorer MD outcomes at 6 months.Results The poorer recovery group had a lower incidence of tinnitus (5.9% vs 27.5%, P=0.015), worse initial best corrected visual acuity (0.22 vs 0, in logMAR, P=0.000), worse preoperative MD (-8.64 vs -3.05, P=0.000) and higher trans-stenotic gradient pressure (19.5 vs 16, P=0.002) and total cranial gradient pressure (TCGP) (25.75 vs 18, P=0.000), lower ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness (90.5 vs 99, P=0.005), higher focal loss volume percentage (2.35 vs 0.84, P=0.002) and global loss volume percentage (4.87 vs 1.8, P=0.012) of GCC. Multivariate analysis showed that worse preoperative MD and higher TCGP (OR 45.61, 95% CI 5.21 to 399.48; P=0.001 and OR 8.45, 95% CI 1.60 to 44.67; P=0.012, respectively) were associated with an increased risk of poorer MD outcomes at the 6-month follow-up.Conclusion This study found that worse preoperative MD and higher TCGP at baseline may be associated with poorer visual outcomes after stenting treatment.

TI Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of indomethacin: Effects on
   cerebral blood flow in anaesthetized sheep
SO CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY
AB 1. Indomethacin has been used to manage raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in humans during neuroanaesthesia and neurosurgery. Indomethacin causes cerebral vasoconstriction and reduces cerebral blood flow (CBF) and, therefore, ICP.
   2. The systemic kinetics, cerebral kinetics and cerebral dynamics of indomethacin (0.2 mg/kg) were measured and modelled using a population approach. Data were collected using an instrumented sheep preparation with raised ICP and under either isoflurane or propofol anaesthesia to parallel the clinical use of indomethacin in neurosurgery.
   3. The systemic kinetics of indomethacin could be described by a two-compartment model, with small distribution volumes and a clearance of 0.68 L/min. The cerebral kinetics of indomethacin could be described using a model with a cerebral distribution volume between 5 and 8 mL and a loss term of 3.3 mL/min, the latter probably representing slow diffusion across the blood-brain barrier.
   4. The changes in CBF lagged behind the blood concentrations of indomethacin. Indirect response models with turnover times of 1.70-4.08 min were generally better able to describe the effect of indomethacin on CBF than effect compartment models.
   5. There was a non-linear concentration effect relationship, with the maximum possible reduction in CBF being to 73-74% of baseline.
   6. The data and model support the concept of indomethacin having limited uptake into the brain, with its effect on CBF being the result of its action on the endothelium, where it indirectly modifies the turnover of a compound regulating vascular tone.

TI Dural sinus thrombosis: a mechanism-based classification and review of
   42 cases
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Cranial venous outflow obstruction due to dural sinus thrombosis may result in venous hypertension, cerebral infarction, cerebral haemorrhage or impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption with consequent pseudotumour syndrome, We propose a mechanism based classification of dural sinus thrombosis from these four outcomes. Forty two cases of dural sinus thrombosis presenting to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital between 1986-1997 were retrospectively reviewed. These cases were classified according to mechanism of presentation and relevance of this to site of thrombosis, treatment and prognosis. This study shows that the superior sagittal sinus and transverse sinus are the commonest sites of thrombosis, and multiple sites of thrombosis (69%) are more frequent than a single site. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with venous flow studies is the investigation of first choice for diagnosis but angiography remains the gold standard. A pseudotumour syndrome is the commonest presentation (43%) followed by cerebral haemorrhage (31%). The overall prognosis for sinus thrombosis is good, with 71% of cases recovering to normal function. (C) 1999 Harcourt Publisher Ltd.

TI Long-term efficacy of venous sinus stenting in the treatment of
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB BackgroundsPrevious studies have suggested that cerebral dural sinus stenosis could be a possible underlying cause of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Venous sinus stenting (VSS) has emerged as a potential alternative for treating IIH related to dural sinus stenosis. However, most of the documented studies have been conducted in Western countries. In this study, we present the results of 16 Chinese IIH patients who underwent VSS treatment in our single center. MethodsWe prospectively collected angiographic and manometric data from IIH patients who underwent angioplasty/stenting. All patients had confirmed dural sinus stenosis and had failed maximal medical therapy (MMT). Demographic, clinical, and radiological presentation, as well as long-term follow-up outcomes were collected retrospectively. ResultsA total of 16 patients who underwent VSS were enrolled in the present study. Demographic data revealed a mean age of 40 (range 20-55), with 69% (11/16) being female, and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 27.05 (range 19.18-38.04) kg/m(2). All patients presented with papilledema and visual disturbances. During a median follow-up period of 47.5 months, 93.75% (15/16) of patients reported improvement in symptoms, although only 37.5% (6/16) experienced complete resolution. Headaches, blurred vision, and amaurosis related to increased pressure improved in 100% (8/8), 81.25% (13/16), and 75% (3/4) of patients, respectively. However, one patient suffered cerebral infarction and secondary epilepsy soon after VSS, and another patient had recurrence of symptoms due to stent wall thrombosis 2 years later. ConclusionsThe significance of venous sinus stenosis in the development of IIH may be undervalued. Our study, based on a Chinese case series, affirms the long-term safety and effectiveness of VSS in treating IIH patients with relatively lower BMI than those from Western countries.

TI Daily generation of a footward fluid shift attenuates ocular changes
   associated with head-down tilt bed rest
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY
AB Astronauts have presented with a constellation of visual changes referred to as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). However, neither have early markers of microgravity-induced optic remodeling been fully identified nor have countermeasures been developed. To identify early markers of SANS, we studied 10 subjects with optical coherence tomography and ultrasonography when upright and supine and again after 24 h of 6 degrees head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest. Upon acute transition from the upright to the supine position, choroid area (2.24 +/- 0.53 to 2.28 +/- 0.52 mm(2), P = 0.001) and volume (9.51 +/- 2.08 to 9.73 +/- 2.08 mm(3), P = 0.002) increased. After 24 h of HDT bed rest, subfoveal choroidal thickness (372 +/- 93 to 381 +/- 95 mu m, P = 0.02), choroid area (2.25 +/- 0.52 to 2.33 +/- 0.54 mm(2), P = 0.08), and volume (9.64 +/- 2.03 to 9.82 +/- 2.08 mm(3), P = 0.08) increased relative to the supine position. Subsequently, seven subjects spent 3 days in 6 degrees HDT bed rest to assess whether low-level lower body negative pressure (LBNP) could prevent the observed choroidal engorgement during bed rest. Maintaining the -6 degrees HDT position for 3 days caused choroid area (Delta 0.11 mm(2), P = 0.05) and volume (Delta 0.45 mm(3), P = 0.003) to increase. When participants also spent 8 h daily under 20 mmHg LBNP, choroid volume still increased, but substantially (40%) less than in the control trial (Delta 0.27 mm(3), P = 0.05). Moreover, the increase in choroid area was diminished (Delta 0.03 mm(2), P = 0.13), indicating that low-level LBNP attenuates the choroid expansion associated with 3 days of -6 degrees HDT bed rest. These data suggest that low-level LBNP may be an effective countermeasure for SANS.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Choroid measurements appear to be sensitive to changes in gravitational gradients, as well as periods of head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest, suggesting that they are potential indicators of early ocular remodeling and could serve to evaluate the efficacy of countermeasures for SANS. Eight hours of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) daily attenuates the choroid expansion associated with 3 days of strict -6 degrees HDT bed rest, indicating that LBNP may be an effective countermeasure for SANS.

TI The Occipital Emissary Vein: A Possible Marker for Pseudotumor Cerebri
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transverse sinus stenosis can lead to pseudotumor cerebri syndrome by elevating the cerebral venous pressure. The occipital emissary vein is an inconstant emissary vein that connects the torcular herophili with the suboccipital veins of the external vertebral plexus. This retrospective study compares the prevalence and size of the occipital emissary vein in patients with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome with those in healthy control subjects to determine whether the occipital emissary vein could represent a marker of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cranial venous system of 46 adult patients with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (group 1) was studied on CT venography images and compared with a group of 92 consecutive adult patients without pseudotumor cerebri syndrome who underwent venous assessment with gadolinium-enhanced 3D-T1 MPRAGE sequences (group 2). The presence of an occipital emissary vein was assessed, and its proximal (intraosseous) and distal (extracranial) maximum diameters were measured and compared between the 2 groups. Seventeen patients who underwent transverse sinus stent placement had their occipital emissary vein diameters measured before and after stent placement.
   RESULTS: Thirty of 46 (65%) patients in group 1 versus 29/ 92 (31.5%) patients in group 2 had an occipital emissary vein (P<.001). The average proximal and distal occipital emissary vein maximum diameters were significantly larger in group 1 (2.3 versus 1.6 mm, P<.005 and 3.3 versus 2.3 mm, P<.001). The average maximum diameters of the occipital emissary vein for patients who underwent transverse sinus stent placement were larger before stent placement than after stent placement: 2.6 versus 1.8 mm proximally (P<.06) and 3.7 versus 2.6 mm distally (P<.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: Occipital emissary veins are more frequent and larger in patients with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome than in healthy subjects, a finding consistent with their role as collateral venous pathway in transverse sinus stenosis. A prominent occipital emissary vein is an imaging sign that should raise the suspicion of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome.

TI Rebound high-pressure headache after treatment of spontaneous
   intracranial hypotension
SO NEUROLOGY-CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB Background
   Rebound high-pressure headaches may complicate treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), but no comprehensive study of such patients has been reported and little is known about its frequency and risk factors. We therefore studied patients undergoing treatment for SIH and performed magnetic resonance venography (MRV) to assess for cerebral venous sinus stenosis, a risk factor for idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
   Methods
   We studied a consecutive group of patients who underwent treatment for SIH. Rebound high-pressure headache was defined as a reverse orthostatic headache responsive to acetazolamide. MRV was obtained in all patients and lateral sinus stenosis was scored according to the system published by Higgins et al., with 0 being normal and 4 signifying bilateral signal gaps.
   Results
   The mean age of the 46 men and 67 women was 45.9 years (range 13-71 years) at the time of onset of SIH. Rebound high-pressure headache was diagnosed in 31 patients (27.4%); 14% of patients with an MRV score of 0, 24% with a score of 1, and 46% with a score of 2 or 3 (p = 0.0092). Also, compared to SIH patients who did not develop rebound high-pressure headaches (n = 82), those with rebound high-pressure headaches were younger, more often female, and more often had an extradural CSF collection on spinal imaging.
   Conclusions
   Rebound high-pressure headache occurs in about one-fourth of patients following treatment of SIH and is more common in those with restriction of cerebral venous outflow.

AB This article reviews the range of hydrodynamic disorders affecting the CSF circulation. Initially consideration is given to questions of definition and classification. A scheme for the practical, clinical analysis for the diagnosis of such disorders is then presented. The physiology and pathophysiology of the CSF circulation is reviewed, with particular emphasis on issues that remain unresolved. This provides a background to consideration of the adverse consequences of abnormal CSF hydrodynamics, again focusing on areas where further information is required. Methods of clinical investigation of CSF hydrodynamics are reviewed, followed by general considerations of treatment. Finally, each of the main, clinically important, forms of disordered CSF hydrodynamics is briefly considered, with particular emphasis, again, on areas where current knowledge is deficient. The conditions considered include hydrocephalus of various forms (childhood, adult, arrested, multi-compartment), infantile macrocephaly, arachnoid and glio-ependymal cysts, syringo- and hydromyelia, pseudotumour cerebri, impaired cranial venous outflow, altered CSF composition, shunt obstruction without ventricular enlargement and low-CSF-pressure states.

TI Dural arteriovenous fistula embolisation with venous remodelling
   following venous sinus stenting
SO BMJ CASE REPORTS
AB We report a case of the formation of a dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) of the transverse-sigmoid sinus following venous sinus stenting (VSS), treated with trans-arterial embolisation and venous remodelling. An obese woman in her 30s presented with persistent daily headaches after undergoing endoscopic repair of a skull base cerebrospinal fluid leak. Angiography demonstrated a focal right transverse-sigmoid sinus stenosis, and she underwent VSS of the right transverse sinus. She developed progressive pulsatile tinnitus within 3 months, and angiography demonstrated the formation of a Borden type 1 dAVF along the stent. Trans-arterial embolisation of the dAVF was performed with venous remodelling using a Copernic RC balloon. While VSS has become a promising treatment for venous sinus stenosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, dAVF formation is a rare but significant potential complication. Embolisation with venous remodelling can be performed to treat these lesions.

TI Rational approach to fetal heart rate monitoring and management during
   the second stage of labor
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
AB Second stage of labor is considered to be associated with an increased risk of intrapartum fetal hypoxic injury. This is due to a combination of several risk factors such as -the increased frequency, strength and duration of uterine contractions due to higher number and affinity of myometrial oxytocin receptors; -the Ferguson's reflex which leads to a reflex release of endogenous oxytocin in response of the distension of the cervix by descending fetal head in late stages of labor; maternal expulsive efforts with the Valsalva manoeuvre that may reduce maternal oxygenation, as well as reduce the venous return and maternal cardiac output due to increased intrathoracic pressure, winch may lead to reduced placental oxygenation; - and increased fetal intracranial pressure due to head compression leading to a potential decrease in fetal cerebral oxygenation. In addition, the umbilical cord often forms one or more loops around the fetal neck, which may get tightened as the head descends leading to an acute and intermittent cessation of fetal oxygenation. Operative interventions during the second stage of labor such as vacuum, forceps or emergency caesarean section may increase the risk of maternal and fetal trauma. Therefore, an accurate interpretation of the fetal heart rate changes by applying the knowledge of fetal pathophysiology is essential: to timely recognise the onset of fetal decompensation preventing intrapartum hypoxic-ischaemic brain injuries; to avoid erroneous monitoring of the maternal heart rate as fetal heart rate; and to abstain from unnecessary operative interventions due to misinterpretation of the significance of the observed fetal heart rate changes.

TI Acute abdominal compartment syndrome in the critically ill
SO JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Acute abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a clinical entity that develops from a progressive, acute increase in pressure within the confined space of the abdominal cavity from a multitude of etiologies. This increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) impacts multiple organ systems in a graded fashion due to differential susceptibilities. While the classic renal, pulmonary, and cardiovascular signs are seen with marked elevations in IAP, we now know that the gut is most sensitive to increases in IAP and develops evidence of endorgan damage earlier in the development of ACS. Furthermore, intracranial derangements with ACS are now well described. Treatment involves expedient decompression of the abdomen, without which the syndrome of end-organ damage and reduced oxygen delivery may lead to the development of multiple organ failure and ultimately death. The scenarios of multiple trauma, hemorrhage with massive volume resuscitation, and/or protracted operation are where ACS is most frequently encountered. However, knowledge of ACS is also essential for the management of critically ill pediatric patients and intensive care patients with acute medical illnesses. The role of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) in the etiology of necrotizing enterocolitis, central obesity comorbidities, and preeclampsia/eclampsia remains to be fully elucidated. This article reviews the experimental background, organ system pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ACS with emphasis on the latest concepts in the literature as they apply to critically ill patients.

TI Neurogenic impairment of cardiopulmonary function in acute cerebral
   lesions
SO NERVENARZT
AB Incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear. Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is characterized as an acute, protein-rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure. NPE is infrequently diagnosed, usually in association with head trauma. Pathophysiological mechanisms include a rise of the pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure either due to sympathetic innervation with pulmonary vasoconstriction or increased left-atrial pressure following systemic arterial hypertension or an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability. In contrast to NPE, cardiac complications are frequently observed, most consistently in patients with subarachoid hemorrhage. Typical ECG changes are repolarization abnormalities, similar to those observed in coronary heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. The CK-MB may be slightly elevated; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left-ventricular function. Pathological examination reveals myofibrillar necrosis. Cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines. For adequate treatment, close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions.

TI ACUTE TRAUMATIC SUBDURAL HYGROMA
SO YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Following head injury, tearing of the arachnoidal villi at the point of their attachment to the dural sinuses may allow the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, through a "ball-valve," into the subdural space over one or both cerebral hemispheres. The quantity of trapped fluid, static or increasing, and the tamponade effect of this "subdural hygroma," which interferes with absorption of the cerebrospinal fluid into the dural venous system, are productive of signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and neurological deficit. 10 cases of acute traumatic subdural hygroma are presented. All were treated operatively, by cranial trephines, subtemporal decompression, with or without drainage. Quantities of fluid evacuated unilaterally or bilaterally varied from 2 to 100 cc. Postoperative results were adjudged to be excellent in 6 cases, good in 3, and poor in 1 (associated intracerebral hematoma and carotid-cavernous sinus fistula). The immediate result of surgical treatment is better in patients with subdural hygroma than in those with subdural hematoma (from which hygroma is indistinguishable clinically), because it is never necessary to reoperate. Long-term follow-up, however, reveals as many complications (epilepsy, mental symptomatology) in the one condition as in the other, because of the frequency of cerebral contusion with each.

TI CARE OF THE ORGAN DONOR
SO ZENTRALBLATT FUR CHIRURGIE
AB Brain death is associated with loss of hypothalamic, pituitary and brain stem function resulting in apnea, bradycardia and hypotension, poikilothermia, and diabetes insipidus. In order to preserve body functions mechanical ventilation is continued with the aim to maintain an arterial partial pressure of oxygen of more than 100 mmHg. Previous fluid restrictions and the application of diuretics during the treatment of high intracranial pressure frequently result in dehydration. Progressive vasodilation may induce severe hypotension and fluid replacement with cristalloids and if necessary colloids may be called for until the central venous pressure reaches 10 cm H2O. Continuous substitution of potassium and the use of hypotonic solutions such as glucose 5 % may avoid hypokalaemia and hypernatraemia, respectively. Inotropic support with dopamine (5 - 10 mug/kg . min) or adrenaline (0.01 - 0.1 mug/kg . min) may be needed to maintain normal mean arterial blood pressure ( 65 mmHg). Polyuria ( 5000 ml/24 h) can be treated by continuous intravenous infusion of antidiuretic hormone (0.5 - 2 - 10 U/h). Hypothermia must be prevented by warming all fluids (37-degrees-C) and covering the patient with heat saving blankets.

TI Dural venous sinus stenting for treatment of pediatric idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background
   Dural venous sinus stenting (VSS) is an effective treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in adult patients. There are no published series to date evaluating safety and efficacy of VSS in pediatric patients.
   Objective
   To report on procedural device selection and technique as well as safety and efficacy of VSS for pediatric patients with medically refractory IIH due to underlying venous sinus stenosis.
   Methods
   A multi-institutional retrospective case series identified patients with medically refractory IIH aged less than 18 years who underwent VSS.
   Results
   14 patients were identified at four participating centers. Patient ages ranged from 10 to 17 years, and 10 patients (71.4%) were female. Mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m(2) (range 15.8-34.6 kg/m(2)). Stenting was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia in all except two patients. The average trans-stenotic gradient during diagnostic venography was 10.6 mm Hg. Patients had stents placed in the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, occipital sinus, and a combination. Average follow-up was 1.7 years after stenting. Six patients out of 10 (60%) had reduced medication dosing, 12 of 14 patients (85.7%) had improvements in headaches, two patients (100%) with pre-stent tinnitus had resolution of symptoms, and four (80%) of five patients with papilledema had improvement on follow-up ophthalmological examinations. Two patients (14.3%) developed postprocedural groin hematomas, one patient (7.1%) developed a groin pseudoaneurysm, and one patient (7.1%) had postprocedural groin bleeding. No other procedural complications occurred. Four patients (28.6%) required further surgical treatment (cerebrospinal shunting and/or stenting) after their first stenting procedure.
   Conclusions
   This series suggests that VSS is feasible in a pediatric population with IIH and has a low complication rate and good clinical outcomes.

TI Venous Sinus Scenting for Transverse Sinus Stenosis Associated with
   Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis in a Patient with Epidermal Growth Factor
   Receptor-Mutated Lung Cancer: A Case Report
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
AB Objective: Unusual or unexpected effect of treatment
   Background: Cerebral venous sinus obstruction associated with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is an extremely rare complication of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. There is little information available on the efficacy of therapeutic options because of its rarity and extremely poor prognosis.
   Case Report: A 57-year-old man presented with severe headache, vomiting, and visual loss for 1 month. Head magnetic resonance venography (MRV) showed occlusion of the left transverse sinus. Gd-enhanced MRI showed no abnormal enhancement. Lumbar puncture intracranial pressure was higher than 40 cmH(2)O. Positive cerebrospinal fluid tumor cytology confirmed the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC). The headache was relieved by repeated lumbar punctures, and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was performed. Cerebral angiography showed severe stenosis of the left transverse sinus without thrombosis, and significant delay of cerebral circulation. The transverse sinus stenosis was judged to be contributing to raised intracranial pressure, and the patient underwent left transverse sinus stent placement. After the procedure, his visual acuity improved, the visual field was enlarged, and his headache could be controlled by medication. Follow-up Gd-enhanced MRI showed dural enhancement and spinal dissemination. Because molecular biology of the surgical specimen showed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations, he was treated with osimertinib for 2 months. He survived for 8 months following the diagnosis of LC and left transverse sinus stenosis.
   Conclusions: Venous sinus stenting can offer an effective palliative interventional option for symptom relief of severe headache and visual symptoms, even in the end stage of malignancy.

TI Surgical Management of Sinus Pericranii With Crouzon Syndrome
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Background: Sinus pericranii (SP) is a rare vascular malformation which connects the intracranial dural sinuses to the extracranial venous drainage system. Although the majority of SP cases are caused by trauma, some of them are congenital. Furthermore, a few SP cases have been reported in association with craniosynostosis. The authors' objective is to discuss the surgical management of SP with Crouzon's syndrome in children. Methods: Three-Dimensional reconstruction with enhanced CT scan was used for evaluate the condition of SP with Crouzon's syndrome in all 4 cases. Two cases with small single-hole defect on skull were only treated by cranioplasty with distraction osteogenesis. In the management of the other 2 SP patients with large skull defect, titanium mesh was used for compression of dilated venous sinus to inhabit filling and promote shrinking. Result: Four cases of SP with Crouzon's syndrome were treated in the authors' department. With cranioplasty with distraction osteogenesis only, 2 patients with single-hole skull defect experienced SP spontaneous involution at 4 to 6 months postoperatively. With titanium mesh compression, SP with large skull defect shrank significantly without clinical recurrence, but long-term follow-up was still in need. Conclusion: For small single-hole skull defect in SP patient with Crouzon's syndrome, the only application of cranioplasty for decreasing intracranial pressure can promote SP spontaneous involution. 3D printed titanium mesh compression renders a safe and efficient approach for SP with large skull defect. Long-time follow up and further accumulation of cases may establish the efficacy of the authors' management.

TI Brain stiffness following recovery in a patient with an episode of
   low-pressure hydrocephalus: case report
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB The authors describe a follow-up to a case of a 19-year-old female with shunted aqueductal stenosis who presented with low-pressure hydrocephalus during a shunt malfunction. Shortly after management with CSF drainage at negative pressure, a magnetic resonance elastography scan was performed and revealed very low brain stiffness (high compliance). Here we present the case of the same patient seen 2 years later, now 21 years old, who again received a magnetic resonance elastography scan after receiving treatment for another shunt malfunction, this time with high intracranial pressure. This scan revealed recovery of brain stiffness to a near normal value for the patients' age. This observation suggests the low brain stiffness observed during the low-pressure hydrocephalus event is reversible. The authors discuss these findings in relation to biomechanical hypotheses of low-pressure hydrocephalus.

TI Patency of the vein of Labbe after venous stenting of the transverse and
   sigmoid sinuses
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Venous sinus stenting is an emerging treatment for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and evidence of venous stenosis. Stents placed across the transverse and sigmoid sinuses often cover the vein of Labbe (VOL), a major anastomotic vein draining the cerebral hemisphere. The patency of the VOL after stenting and its clinical implications are poorly understood.
   Methods A retrospective analysis was performed of a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing venous sinus stenting. Pre- and post-stent angiography were compared to assess changes in VOL patency, clinical and radiographic outcomes.
   Results The study cohort comprised 56 patients. The stent covered the VOL in 92.9% of cases. Thirty-two cases with VOL coverage had evaluable angiograms immediately after stent placement. Among these, VOL filled normally in 75.0%, exhibited diminished caliber with normal transit time in 3.1%, filled sluggishly in 18.8%, and was occluded in 3.1%. Follow-up was assessed in patients with at least 3 months' angiographic follow-up (46 patients, mean 7.2 months). Of these, normal filling was seen in 71.7%, diminished caliber in 26.1%, and sluggish filling in 2.2% of cases. Neither stent coverage of the VOL nor its patency immediately after stenting or at follow-up correlated with stent-adjacent stenosis. There were no neurological sequelae from coverage of the VOL or alteration of its drainage pattern.
   Conclusions In the majority of venous stenting cases involving the transverse and sigmoid sinuses, the VOL remains widely patent. Complete VOL occlusion rarely occurs after stenting and may not result in clinical sequelae. Stent coverage of the VOL should not deter the therapeutic use of venous sinus stenting.

TI Effect of mild hypothermia on severe traumatic brain injury and
   expression of serum VEGF, TNF-α and IL-6
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Objective: To investigate the effect of mild hypothermia on severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) and expression of VEGF and inflammatory factors. Methods: Ninety-two patients with sTBI were selected and divided into control group (n=46) and observation group (n=46). Patients in the control group received conventional treatment, and patients in the observation group were treated with extra mild hypothermia on the basis of conventional treatment. The changes of cerebral edema volume, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), intracranial pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), inflammatory factors and coagulation function were compared between the two groups. Results: After treatment for 1 d to 14 d, the volume of cerebral edema in the observation group was smaller than that in the control group (P<0.05). Serum VEGF level increased and plasma MMP-9 level decreased in the two groups after treatment (all P<0.001), but VEGF and MMP-9 levels were both significantly lower in the observation group than those in the control group (P<0.01). After treatment, intracranial pressure was significantly decreased and CVP was significantly increased in both groups (all P<0.001), but the two indicators were both significantly lower in the observation group than those in the control group (P<0.05). Besides, serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 levels in both groups were decreased after treatment (P<0.001), and the levels in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01). After 6 months of treatment, Glasgow outcome scale score was higher in the observation group than that in the control group (P<0.001). In addition, serum fibrinogen level in the two groups decreased and D-dimer level increased after treatment (all P<0.05), but the above two indicators were lower in the observation group than those in the control group (P<0.05). Thrombin time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were prolonged in both groups (P<0.05), which were all longer in the observation group than those in the control group (P<0.01). Besides, there were no significant differences in the incidence rate of total complications between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: Mild hypothermia treatment can effectively reduce cerebral edema in patients with sTBI, inhibit the expression of VEGF, and alleviate the inflammatory response.

TI Treatment of traumatic brain injury in pediatrics
SO CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY
AB The primary goal in treating any pediatric patient with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the prevention of secondary insults such as hypotension, hypoxia, and cerebral edema. Despite the publication of guidelines, significant variations in the treatment of severe TBI continue to exist, especially in regards to intracranial pressure (ICP)-guided therapy. This variability in treatment results mainly from a paucity of data from which to create standards and from the heterogeneity inherent in pediatric TBI. The approach to management of severe TBI based on the published guidelines should be focused on ICP control, which should ultimately improve cerebral perfusion pressure. After identifying and surgically evacuating expanding hematomas, the first-tier treatment approach requires placing an ICP monitor. This is accompanied by medical management of elevated ICP, initially with simple maneuvers such as elevating the head of the bed to improve venous drainage, instituting sedation and analgesia to decrease metabolic demands of the brain, and draining cerebrospinal fluid. If these measures fail, then further first-tier interventions include hyperosmolar therapy to decrease cerebral edema and controlled ventilation to decrease cerebral blood volume. For elevations of ICP resistant to first-tier therapies, treatment escalates to second-tier therapy, which includes more aggressive measures such as placing jugular catheters to measure cerebral oxygenation with moderate hyperventilation, placing lumbar drains to remove more cerebrospinal fluid, administering high-dose barbiturates to suppress cerebral electrical activity, inducing hypothermia as a protective measure, and performing decompressive craniectomy to open the cranial vault. To properly execute these interventions, appropriate neuromonitoring is essential, starting from standard physiological parameters such as ICP, mean arterial blood pressure, and temperature. Additional modalities of neurologic monitoring are becoming more readily available and can provide additional clinically useful information about the pediatric patient with TBI; these include cerebral oxygenation, continuous electroencephalography, noninvasive blood flow monitoring, and advanced neuroimaging.

TI PRO: The "Lund Concept" for Treatment of Patients With Severe Traumatic
   Brain Injury
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB Two different main concepts for the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury have been established during the last 15 years, namely the more conventional concept recommended in well-established guidelines (eg, the US Guideline, European Guideline, Addelbrook's Guideline from Cambridge) on the one hand, and the Lund concept from the University Hospital of Lund, Sweden on the other. Owing to the lack of well-controlled randomized outcome studies comparing these 2 main therapeutic approaches, we cannot conclude that one is better than the other. This study is the PRO part in a PRO-CON debate on the Lund concept in the present journal. Although the Lund concept is based on a physiology-oriented approach dealing with hemodynamic principles of brain volume and brain perfusion regulation, traditional treatments are primarily based on a meta-analytic approach from clinical studies. High cerebral perfusion pressure has been an essential goal in the conventional treatments (the cerebral perfusion pressure-guided approach), even though it has been modified in a recent update of US guidelines. The Lund concept has instead concentrated on management of brain edema and intracranial pressure, simultaneously with improvement of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (the intracranial pressure and perfusion-guided approach). Although conventional guidelines are restricted to clinical data from meta-analytic surveys, the physiological approach of the Lund therapy finds support in both experimental and clinical studies. It offers a wider base and can also give recommendations regarding fluid therapy, lung protection, optimal hemoglobin concentration, temperature control, the use of decompressive craniotomy, and ventricular drainage. This study puts forward arguments in support of the Lund therapy.

TI Suboccipital decompression during posterior cranial vault remodeling for
   selected cases of Chiari malformations associated with craniosynostosis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB Object. The optimal management of Chiari malformations in the setting of craniosynostosis is not well established. In this report the authors describe their outcomes with the combined technique of simultaneous suboccipital decompression (SOD) during posterior cranial vault remodeling (PCVR).
   Methods. A retrospective review was performed of all patients undergoing PCVR and simultaneous SOD. Demographic data, diagnosis, imaging studies, operative intervention, and clinical follow-up were evaluated.
   Results. Thirty-four patients were identified as having undergone a simultaneous PCVR/SOD for Chiari malformation associated with craniosynostosis. Eighty-eight percent of these patients had syndromic, multisutural craniosynostosis, and the remaining patients had unilateral lambdoid craniosynostosis. There were no postoperative complications as a direct result from this combined procedure. Two patients required a subsequent direct approach for decompression of the Chiari malformation. The interval between these subsequent surgeries was 3 years and 19 months.
   Conclusions. Chiari malformations are commonly associated with syndromic, complex craniosynostosis and isolated lambdoid craniosynostosis. In appropriately selected patients, a combined posterior cranial vault enlargement and SOD of the foramen magnum is associated with a low complication rate and appears to be an effective procedure.

AB As any other organ, the spinal cord also suffers in chronic congestion. Since the epidural venous system drains into the vena cava system and participates in collateral circulation, there is increased inflow with impaired blood flow along its large tributaries in the vertebral canal along with poor outflow, resulting in intracranial hypertension and chronic congestion. Venous hemodinamic disorders are found beyond the vertebral canal and detected by selective phlebography of the large tributaries of the vena cava system. The technique was used to examine 52 patients with spastic paraparesis or tetraparesis of unclear etiology, which provides evidence for the fact that vena cava stenosis, compressions, atresia and thrombosis can be responsible for impaired venous hemodinamics in the vertebral complex and its surgical correction is possible. 17 operations was carried out in 12 patients and this results are discussed.

TI Stenting versus medical treatment for idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension: a matched-control study
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background This prospective cohort study compared the outcomes of stenting and medical treatment for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and venous sinus stenosis (VSS). Methods In this single-center cohort study, patients with IIH and VSS were evaluated between January 2014 and December 2019 with follow-up periods of 1, 3, and 6 months. The patients received either stenting or medical treatment. The two groups underwent 1:1 matching using propensity score analysis, and the clinical outcomes were compared. Results Following 1:1 matching, 36 patients who underwent stenting and 36 who underwent medical treatment were matched. The median improvements in the papilledema Frisen grade were greater in the stenting group at 1 month (-2 vs 0), 3 months (-3 vs -1), and 6 months (-3 vs -1) than in the medical treatment group. Patients who received stenting treatment had a significantly higher prevalence of complete resolution of their respective symptoms (headache, tinnitus, or visual disturbances) at 3 months (58.3% vs 13.9%, OR 8.68, 95% CI 2.74 to 27.52) and 6 months (80.6% vs 22.2%, OR 14.50, 95% CI 4.64 to 45.32) than those receiving medical treatment. Conclusions This matched-control study shows that stenting has a greater efficacy rate and rapid resolution of papilledema and its respective symptoms compared with medical treatment.

TI Acute Vision Loss Secondary to Epidural Blood Patch <i>Terson
   Syndrome</i>
SO REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE
AB Background and Objectives: Lumbar epidural blood patch (EBP) is a commonly used procedure to treat postdural puncture headache. We present a case of vision loss immediately following an EBP.
   Case Report: A 49-year-old woman with idiopathic intracranial hypertension received an EBP for postdural puncture headache at an outside facility without fluoroscopic guidance and in the seated position. The patient experienced syncope during the procedure as 25 mL of autologous blood was rapidly injected. The patient regained consciousness and described bilateral vision loss. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was negative for hemorrhage. Dilated fundus examination revealed significant, bilateral retinal and vitreous hemorrhage consistent with Terson syndrome.
   Conclusions: This patient developed Terson syndrome as an immediate EBP complication. Iatrogenic Terson syndrome has been previously described with epidural space saline and anesthetic injections, but not EBP. Of 11 reported cases, 10 were female, and 9 had complete vision recovery. Previous studies have demonstrated that epidural space injection increases subarachnoid pressure in a volume-and rate-dependent fashion. An abrupt increase in subarachnoid space pressure likely led to retinal hemorrhage by compromising retinal venous drainage. This is the first known case of Terson syndrome caused by EBP. Injectate volume should be minimized, and a slow rate of injection pursued. The anesthesiologist, pain interventionist, and ophthalmologist should be aware of this rare but disabling complication and consider taking extra precautions when consenting patients for EBP with vision compromise or comorbidities concerning for elevated intracranial pressure.

TI Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCES IN RURAL PRACTICE
AB Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) is a rare phenomenon that can be seen with some frequency in young patients. CSVT is a multifactorial condition with gender-related specific causes, with a wide clinical presentation, the leading causes differ between developed and developing countries, converting CSVT in a condition characterized by a highly variable clinical spectra, difficult diagnosis, variable etiologies and prognosis that requires fine medical skills and a high suspicious index. Patients who presents with CSVT should underwent to CT-scan venography (CVT) and to the proper inquiry of the generating cause. This disease can affect the cerebral venous drainage and related anatomical structure. The symptoms may appear in relation to increased intracranial pressure imitating a pseudotumorcerebri. Prognosis depends on the early detection. Correcting the cause, generally the complications can be prevented. Mortality trends have diminished, and with the new technologies, surely it will continue. This work aims to review current knowledge about CSVT including its pathogenesis, etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment.

TI Dantrolene Mediates Vasorelaxation in Cerebral Vasoconstriction: A Case
   Series
SO NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB Cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes such as vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and trauma, or Call-Fleming syndrome are difficult to treat, and can lead to substantial disability and death. Dantrolene, a ryanodine receptor antagonist, inhibits intracellular calcium release from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum. We examined the effect of dantrolene on middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocities as measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD).
   Three consecutive patients with elevated MCA TCD velocities receiving dantrolene (2.5 mg/kg i.v. q6h) were retrospectively reviewed. Average MCA peak systolic, mean flow velocities, and the pulsatility index (PI) before and after the dantrolene infusion were compared within patients. Systemic physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, intracranial pressure, body temperature, and cooling water temperature) were retrospectively collected 6 h before and after the dantrolene infusion.
   MCA peak systolic velocities (mean +/- A SE) for the three patients were 297 +/- A 3, 248 +/- A 8, and 268 +/- A 19 cm/s before dantrolene and 159 +/- A 9, 169 +/- A 8, and 216 +/- A 12 cm/s after dantrolene. Average mean flow velocities showed the same trend. Interestingly, the PI increased slightly from 0.6, 0.52, and 0.67 before dantrolene, to 1.17, 0.71, and 0.77 after dantrolene. Systemic physiological parameters remained stable in all three patients.
   Dantrolene attenuated cerebral vasoconstriction as measured by TCD without altering systemic physiological parameters. This suggests that intracellular calcium release from ryanodine channels in smooth muscle might play a role in vasospasm. A prospective study is underway to test this hypothesis.

TI Conventional posterior cranial vault expansion: indications and
   results-review of the literature
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB In the late 1980s, craniofacial surgery units reported suboptimal cosmetic results, cranial volume restriction, and intracranial hypertension after anterior cranial vault remodeling in bilateral coronal synostosis associated with severe brachyturricephaly. A possible explanation was a severe associated growth restriction of the posterior calvaria with radiological synostosis at the lambda sutures. "Conventional" or "fixed" posterior cranial vault expansion techniques were developed to address these limitations, sometimes as the first surgical step in a two-staged protocol of total calvarial reconstruction, combined with suboccipital decompression in cases of symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar herniation or, more easily, to resolve the characteristic occipital flattening of lambdoid synostosis. Various surgical approaches have been described; however, the indications for and timing of surgical treatment and postoperative evaluation of results still remain controversial. Although more invasive, conventional posterior cranial vault expansion has proven to be safe and offers a remodeled and protective bony vault immediately after surgery, but the underlying cranial base malformation remained untreated, with implications in the postoperative growth of the facial skeleton. Overcorrection, rigid stabilization, and grafting are also concerns to be addressed.

TI Intracranial Hypotension and Hypertension Associated With Reconstructive
   Cranioplasty After Decompressive Craniectomy: Report of a Lethal
   Complication With Recommended Strategies for Future Avoidance
SO JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
AB Reconstructive cranioplasty can be associated with many complications and add to the not insignificant potential risks associated with decompressive craniectomy. In the setting of post-traumatic hydrocephalus, treatment with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt prior to reconstructive cranioplasty likely increases these risks even further. The authors report a case of a 17-year-old male with a history of a severe closed head injury who initially suffered a life-threatening complication associated with intracranial hypotension after cranioplasty only to succumb to malignant intracranial hypertension following a second cranioplasty attempt. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a single patient developing both these disparate complications after reconstructive cranioplasty and emphasizes the likely synergistic hazards involved with decompressive craniectomy in the setting of a VP shunt in particular and the overall myriad potential complications that may be associated with reconstructive cranioplasty in general.

TI Quality of life, need for retreatment, and the re-equilibration
   phenomenon after venous sinus stenting for idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Long term failure rates after venous sinus stenting (VSS) for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are poorly understood.
   Methods Retrospective analysis was performed on a prospectively-maintained single center database to identify patients with medically refractory IIH who underwent VSS. Patients with persistent or severe recurrent symptoms after VSS undergo lumbar puncture (LP), therefore LP serves as a marker for treatment failure.
   Results 81 patients underwent VSS with a mean follow-up of 10 months; 44 (54.3%) patients underwent LP after VSS due to persistent or recurrent symptoms at a mean of 12 months (median 7, range 2-43). There was a mean decrease in opening pressure (OP) on LP from pre- to post-VSS of 9.1 cm H2O (median 9.5). Overall, a total of 21 (25.9%) patients underwent further surgical intervention following VSS, including five who underwent repeat VSS (6.2% of total) and 18 who underwent cerebrospinal fluid shunting (22.2% of total). There was a non-significant (p=0.18) but overall increase in quality of life scores from pre-stenting (61.2) to last follow-up (71.2), and a significant decrease in Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) scores (p=0.03) with mean pre-stenting and last follow-up scores of 62.7 and 55.8, respectively.
   Conclusions VSS is an effective treatment for venous sinus stenosis in IIH; however, this study found higher rates of symptomatic recurrence and need for further surgical intervention (26%) than previously reported in the literature. Recurrence of symptoms occurred at a median of 7 months, even though OP remained lower at follow-up LP, suggestive of a re-equilibration phenomenon.

TI Magnetic Resonance-Based Estimation of Intracranial Pressure Correlates
   With Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Valve Opening Pressure Setting in
   Children With Hydrocephalus
SO INVESTIGATIVE RADIOLOGY
AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the pressure setting of the ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt valve and a magnetic resonance (MR)-based estimate of intracranial pressure (ICP) in children with shunt-treated hydrocephalus without clinical signs of shunt malfunction.
   Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained before the study, and all subjects and/or their legal guardians provided written informed consent. In this prospective study, 15 consecutive patients (median age, 8.25 years; range, 2.2-18.4 years; 6 girls and 9 boys) with shunt-treated hydrocephalus without signs of shunt malfunction were examined with retrospectively gated phase contrast sequences to quantify arterial inflow, venous outflow, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow to and from the cranial vault. The ratio of the maximal intracranial volume change and the pulse pressure gradient change was used to derive MR-ICP. Spearman Q was used to test for the association of setting of the shunt valve opening pressure and MR-ICP.
   Results: Shunt valve opening pressure settings and MR-ICP were positively correlated (Spearman rho = 0.64, P < 0.01). Median MR-ICP was 8.67 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR], 1.59 mm Hg) and median setting of the VP-shunt valve was 6.62 mm Hg (IQR, 1.47 mm Hg). The median MR-ICP was 1.9 mm Hg (IQR, 0.73 mm Hg) higher than the setting of the shunt valve.
   Conclusion: There is a positive correlation between MR-ICP and VP shunt valve opening pressure setting. The systematically higher assessment of MR-ICP is most likely a result of outflow resistance within the shunt tubing system and well within the known fluctuation rates of VP shunt systems.

TI Extraluminal Sigmoid Sinus Angioplasty: A Pertinent Reconstructive
   Surgical Method Targeting Dural Sinus Hemodynamics to Resolve Pulsatile
   Tinnitus
SO OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY
AB Objectives: 1) To provide information on the treatment of pulsatile tinnitus (PT) with transtemporal extralurninal sigmoid sinus angioplasty (ESSA); and 2) to discuss the current clinical management of PT.
   Study Design: This was a retrospective study.
   Settings: Multi-institutional tertiary university medical centers.
   Patients: Fifty-four PT patients with transverse sigmoid sinus enlargement and prominent transverse sigmoid junction with or without sigmoid sinus wall anomalies or transverse sinus anomalies.
   Intervention: All patients underwent ESSA under local anesthesia.
   Main Outcome Measures: Intraoperative discoveries and surgical resolution of PT, morphology; and computational fluid dynamics.
   Results: Fifty-three of the 54 (98%) patients experienced a significant reduction in, or complete resolution of, PT after ESSA. No major surgical complications occurred, except for one case where we observed a full collapse of the sinus wall. On average, this surgery reduced the cross-sectional area at the transverse sigmoid junction by 61.5%. Our intraoperative discoveries suggest that sigmoid sinus wall anomalies may not be a definitive cause of PT. The transverse sigmoid sinus system was significantly larger (in term of both cross-sectional area and volume) on the ipsilesional side compared with the contralesional side. Following ESSA, the vascular wall pressure and vortex flow at the transverse sigmoid junction decreased considerably, and the flow velocity and wall shear stress increased significantly.
   Conclusion: ESSA is a highly effective surgical technique for PT patients with transverse sigmoid sinus enlargement and prominent transverse sigmoid junction, regardless of whether they also have sigmoid sinus wall or transverse sinus anomalies. A large transverse sigmoid system with prominent transverse sigmoid junction is a predisposing factor for PT, and only by improving patients' intrasinus hemodynamics could PT be resolved efficiently. In cases without complete obstruction of venous return, ESSA is safe. No postoperative complications related to neurological disorders were observed.

TI Acute low-pressure hydrocephalus: a case series and systematic review of
   195 patients
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE Acute low-pressure hydrocephalus (ALPH) is characterized by clinical manifestations of an apparent raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and ventriculomegaly despite measured ICP that is below the expected range (i.e., typically <= 5 cm H2O). ALPH is often refractory to standard hydrocephalus intervention protocols and the ICP paradox commonly leads to delayed diagnosis. The aim of this study was to characterize ALPH and develop an algorithm to facilitate diagnosis and management for patients with ALPH.
   METHODS EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases were searched for ALPH cases from its first description in 1994 until 2019. Cases that met inclusion criteria were pooled with cases managed at the authors' institution. Patient characteristics, presenting signs/symptoms, precipitating factors, temporizing interventions, definitive treatment, and patient outcomes were recorded.
   RESULTS There were 195 patients identified, with 42 local and 153 from the literature review (53 pediatric patients and 142 adults). Decreased level of consciousness was the predominant clinical sign. The most common etiologies of hydrocephalus were neoplasm and hemorrhage. While the majority of ALPH occurred spontaneously, 39% of pediatric patients had previously undergone a lumbar puncture. Prior to ALPH diagnosis, 92% of pediatric and 39% of adult patients had a ventricular shunt in situ. The most common temporizing intervention was subatmospheric CSF drainage. The majority of patients underwent a shunt insertion/revision or endoscopic third ventriculostomy as definitive ALPH treatment. Although the mortality rate was 11%, 83% of pediatric and 49% of adult patients returned to their pre-ALPH neurological functional status after definitive treatment. Outcomes were related to both the severity of the underlying neurosurgical disease causing the hydrocephalus and the efficacy of ALPH treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS ALPH is an underrecognized variant phenotype of hydrocephalus that is associated with multiple etiologies and can be challenging to treat as it frequently does not initially respond to standard strategies of CSF shunting. With early recognition, ALPH can be effectively managed. A management algorithm is provided as a guide for this purpose.

TI Transcranial Doppler monitoring during laparoscopic anterior lumbar
   interbody fusion
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB We studied the consequences on cerebral hemodynamics of lengthy laparoscopic procedures requiring pneumoperitoneum and head-down positioning. From October 1995 to April 1999, 17 ASA status I or II patients (16 women and 1 man; mean age, 38 yr) were treated with laparoscopic anterior lumbar fusion. Besides standard perioperative monitoring for laparoscopic surgery, the mean blood-flow velocity of both middle cerebral arteries and the pulsatility index were determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Adequate acoustic windows were encountered in 11 of the 17 patients, and the remaining 6 were excluded from the analysis. PaCO2 and end-tidal CO2 were maintained within normal limits (<40 mm Hg); ventilation was optimized in all cases. There was a significant increase (P<0.05) in heart rate and central venous pressure with the change from supine to head-down position in all patients. Transcranial Doppler results for mean middle cerebral artery blood-flow velocity and pulsatility index showed no significant variations at any of the four time points studied during the procedure. There were no technique-related complications, except for moderate postoperative headache in eight patients that resolved with rest and oxygen therapy. We conclude that lengthy laparoscopic procedures in the head-down position performed in otherwise healthy patients do not significantly affect intracranial circulation.

TI Deep cerebral venous thrombosis in adults
SO CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Objective To investigate the pathogenesis, clinical features, radiographic findings and therapeutic outcomes of non-acute intracranial deep venous thrombosis in adults.
   Methods Five patients who presented with increased intracranial pressure were examined with computed tomography, magnetic resonance and angiography, diagnosed as having non-acute intracranial deep venous thrombosis, and treated with thrombolytic therapy. They were reviewed retrospectively.
   Results There were 3 men and 2 women, aged from 22 to 49 years. Symptom duration ranged from 1 month to 7 months, and 4 of the 5 patients were associated with venous sinus thrombosis. Two patients developed cold and fever before the onset of disease, and 3 patients had no evident predisposing factors. After the infusion of thrombolytic and systemic anti-coagulant therapy, the neurological symptoms and signs of the patients were alleviated.
   Conclusions Digital subtraction angiography ( DSA) is more sensitive and accurate than MRI on diagnosing intracranial deep venous thrombosis. It may play an important role in the assessment of the treatment of intracranial deep venous thrombosis. Thrombolysis and anticoagulation of intracranial deep venous thrombosis appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment not only in the acute stage but also in the non-acute stage.

TI Primary cough headache, primary exertional headache, and primary
   headache associated with sexual activity: a clinical and radiological
   study
SO NEURORADIOLOGY
AB The purposes of this study are to describe clinical features of primary cough headache, primary exertional headache, and primary headache associated with sexual activity and to evaluate potential association with abnormalities in the cerebral or cervical venous circulation.
   This multicentre, observational, non-interventional consecutive cohort study included patients fulfilling ICHD-II criteria for primary cough headache (N = 10), primary exertional headache (N = 11), or primary headache associated with sexual activity (N = 20), as well as 16 headache-free controls. Each patient was evaluated clinically and underwent craniocervical MRV of the cranial circulation. All scans were interpreted centrally by blinded raters, using the Farb criteria proposed for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Stenosis was defined as a Farb score < 3 in left or right transverse sinuses or jugular veins.
   In all primary headache groups, headaches were most frequently diffuse, severe, or very severe. Headache duration was significantly shorter in patients with cough headache (median 6.5 versus 20 and 60 min). An exploitable magnetic resonance venogram was obtained for 36 patients. Stenosis was detected in none of the control group, but in 5/7 patients with primary cough headache group, 2/10 patients with primary exertion headache, and 12/19 patients with primary headache associated with sexual activity. The frequency of stenosis was significantly different from the control group in the primary cough headache and primary headache associated with sexual activity groups.
   Headaches provoked by cough and sexual activity are possibly associated with venous abnormalities in a significant subgroup of affected patients. As the literature shows conflicting results, this venous stenosis can be considered as a promoting factor.

TI Impaired drainage of vein of Labbe following venous sinus stenting for
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Purpose The impact of venous sinus stenting (VSS) on vein of Labbe (VOL) drainage is poorly understood. The purpose of the study is to examine the incidence and potential high risk factors of impaired VOL drainage among idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients following VSS.
   Materials and methods I nstitutional review board approved prospective evaluation of all IIH patients who underwent VSS over a 5 year period (January 2012 to December 2017) at Weill Cornell Medical Center constituted the study population. Patient demographics, procedural details (laterality of stenting, balloon angioplasty, number of stents, and stent diameters), morphology of the VOL and changes in the flow in the VOL, type of sinus stenosis, and transverse sinus symmetry were evaluated. We used.2 analysis to evaluate impaired VOL drainage against other variables. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.
   Results 70 consecutive patients (67 women, 3 men) with a mean age of 31 +/- 9.8 years underwent VSS. Stenosis was extrinsic in 63% (n=44) and intrinsic in 37% (n=26) of patients. Impaired drainage of the VOL was detected in 9/70 (13%) patients. Ipsilateral VOL was recognized as dominant in 20% (n=14), co-dominant in 51% (n=36), and non-dominant in 29% (n=20) of patients. Impaired VOL drainage was significantly associated with ipsilateral VOL dominance (P=0.001) and stent diameter of >= 9 mm (P=0.042). All patients demonstrated widely patent VOL on follow-up contrast enhanced MR venography at 3 months and 24 months.
   Conclusion I mpaired drainage of the ipsilateral VOL is a potential consequence of VSS with 13% incidence, and has significant association with ipsilateral superficial cortical venous drainage via dominant VOL and stent diameter of >= 9 mm.

TI Safety and efficacy comparison between OACs plus single antiplatelet and
   dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with cerebral venous sinus
   stenosis poststenting
SO BMC NEUROLOGY
AB Background and purpose The present strategies regarding poststent management for cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS) are inconsistent. Herein, we compared the safety and efficacy of oral anticoagulants (OACs) plus single antiplatelet therapy and dual antiplatelet therapy for CVSS poststenting. Methods A real-world observational study conducted from January 2009 through October 2019 enrolled patients who were diagnosed with CVSS and received stenting. Patients were divided into two groups according to the management they received poststenting. Group 1: OACs plus a single antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel 75 mg or aspirin 100 mg) and Group 2: dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel 75 mg plus aspirin 100 mg). The safety (such as major or minor bleeding or venous thrombosis) and efficacy (the incidences of cerebral venous sinus restenosis, intrastent thrombosis, or stent displacement) of the two groups were compared. Results There were a total of 110 eligible patients in the final analysis, including 79 females and 31 males with a mean age of 43.42 +/- 13.23 years. No major bleeding or venous thrombosis occurred in either of the two groups. Two minor bleeding events occurred in group 2 (one with subcutaneous bleeding points in both lower limbs, another with submucosal bleeding in the mouth), whereas no bleeding events occurred in Group 1. In addition, at the 1-year follow-up, one case of intraluminal restenosis and two cases of in-stent thrombi occurred in Group 2, while none occurred in Group 1. Neither stenosis at stent-adjacent segments nor stent migration was detected in either group during the 1-year following stent placement. Conclusion OACs plus single antiplatelet therapy and dual antiplatelet therapy alone are both safe and efficacious management strategies after CVSS stent placement. The former may have more advantages than the latter for inhibiting intrastent thrombosis. However, further research by larger, multicenter clinical trials is needed.

TI Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure on cerebral hemodynamics in
   acute brain injury patients
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Background: Cerebral autoregulation is the mechanism that allows to maintain the stability of cerebral blood flow despite changes in cerebral perfusion pressure. Maneuvers which increase intrathoracic pressure, such as the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), have been always challenged in brain injured patients for the risk of increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) and altering autoregulation. The primary aim of this study is to assess the effect of PEEP increase (from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O) on cerebral autoregulation. Secondary aims include the effect of PEEP increase on ICP and cerebral oxygenation.Material and Methods: Prospective, observational study including adult mechanically ventilated patients with acute brain injury requiring invasive ICP monitoring and undergoing multimodal neuromonitoring including ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral oxygenation parameters obtained with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and an index which expresses cerebral autoregulation (PRx). Additionally, values of arterial blood gases were analyzed at PEEP of 5 and 15 cmH(2)O. Results are expressed as median (interquartile range).Results: Twenty-five patients were included in this study. The median age was 65 years (46-73). PEEP increase from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O did not lead to worsened autoregulation (PRx, from 0.17 (-0.003-0.28) to 0.18 (0.01-0.24), p = 0.83). Although ICP and CPP changed significantly (ICP: 11.11 (6.73-15.63) to 13.43 (6.8-16.87) mm Hg, p = 0.003, and CPP: 72.94 (59.19-84) to 66.22 (58.91-78.41) mm Hg, p = 0.004), these parameters did not reach clinically relevant levels. No significant changes in relevant cerebral oxygenation parameters were observed.Conclusion: Slow and gradual increases of PEEP did not alter cerebral autoregulation, ICP, CPP and cerebral oxygenation to levels triggering clinical interventions in acute brain injury patients.

TI Pulsatile Tinnitus Due to Stenosis of the Marginal Sinus: Diagnosis and
   Endovascular Treatment
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Venous pulsatile tinnitus is a disabling condition mainly caused by a stenosis of the lateral sinus. Here, we aimed to report a novel cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus, stenosis of the marginal sinus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with isolated venous pulsatile tinnitus for which the suspected cause was a stenosis of the marginal sinus, treated or not, between January 2017 and December 2020. Patient charts and imaging were systematically reviewed. All patients underwent noncontrast temporal bone CT and MR imaging. RESULTS: Eight patients (7 women; median age, 36?years) were included. Six patients (75%) were overweight, and 1 patient had idiopathic intracranial hypertension. All patients presented with a typical venous pulsatile tinnitus. The stenosis of the marginal sinus was detected using oblique reconstructions on postcontrast 3D MR imaging. There was no other pathologic finding except ipsilateral stenosis of the lateral sinus in 3 patients. Four patients underwent endovascular therapy with placement of a stent in the marginal sinus, leading to complete resolution of the pulsatile tinnitus for all of them. No complication occurred. Of note, the symptoms of intracranial hypertension also regressed after stent placement in that patient. CONCLUSIONS: Marginal sinus stenosis is a novel cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus, which can be easily detected on MR imaging. Marginal sinus stent placement is safe and efficient. We hypothesized that the marginal sinus stenosis pathophysiology is similar to that of lateral sinus stenosis, which is a common and well-known cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus, explaining the similar clinical presentation and endovascular management.

TI Perioperative mannitol intensive use may avoid the early complication of
   cerebral venous sinus stenting
SO ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: Cerebral venous sinus (CVS) stenting has been widely applied for correcting CVS stenosis. However, there are still some potential complications. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of perioperative management on avoiding complications of CVS stenting.
   Methods: Patients confirmed as CVS stenosis were enrolled from January 2014 through November 2019. All CVS stenosis were corrected by stenting when the trans-stenotic mean pressure gradient (MPG) was up to or over 8 mmHg. Patients were divided into perioperative management group and control group. Patients in the former group underwent transiently mannitol 250 mL intravenous infusion immediately prior to stenting besides routine ICP control. While patients in control group underwent the same routine treatment as in the perioperative management group. The clinical symptoms, intracranial pressure (ICP), and MPG of the patients were compared before and after stenting. In addition, the complications between the two groups were compared.
   Results: A total of 81 eligible patients were finally enrolled in this study, including 64 females and 17 males, mean aged 45.35 +/- 13.83 years. After stenting, the stenotic CVS restored normal blood flow and MPG decreased significantly [10.0 (8.0-15.0) vs. 0.0 (0.0-0.7) mmHg, P<0.001]. Headache, tinnitus, visual impairment, visual loss, Frisen papilledema grade (FPG), and ICP were ameliorated immediately (P<0.001) in the majority of patients in the two groups. However, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was higher in control group (11.4% vs. 0.0%, P=0.031).
   Conclusions: A transiently strict preoperative ICP control by mannitol may inhibit CVS stenting-related hemorrhage, which makes the stenting safer and more effective on correcting the CVS stenosis.

AB BackgroundBased on increased understanding of the idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) pathophysiology, venous sinus stenting (VSS) has emerged as an effective treatment for patients with transverse sinus stenosis (TSS). The presence of a reliable TSS screening tool is warranted. The combined conduit score (CCS) is the most widely used score for evaluation of the cerebral sinovenous stenosis in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography (CE-MRV).Purpose of the StudyTo evaluate the interobserver agreement between neuro-interventionalists and radiologists with respect to the CCS in evaluation of transverse sinus stenosis in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension using CE-MRV.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted on 26 consecutive patients diagnosed with IIH and underwent CE-MRV. The 2 neuro-interventionalists and 2 radiologists separately evaluated the cerebral venous sinuses using the CCS.ResultsThe mean CCS was significantly different between the neuro-interventionalists and radiologists (p < 0.001), higher for the radiologists. The inter-rater reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.954, 95% CI: 0.898-0.979) between the 2 neuro-interventionalists, good between the 2 radiologists (ICC = 0.805, 95% CI: 0.418-0.921), but was not acceptable between the neuro-interventionalists and the radiologists (ICC 0.47 95% CI:-2.2-0.782).ConclusionDespite the excellent agreement between the neuro-interventionists and the good agreement between the radiologists, there was no agreement between the neuro-interventionists and the radiologists. Our finding suggests that there is a gap between the 2 specialties but does not favor any of them. Factors related to the observers, the venous sinus system, the MRV or the CCS score may have resulted in this discrepancy. Automatic or semi-automatic feature extractions to produce quantifiable biomarkers for IIH are warranted. The clinical decisions should not depend only on strongly observer-dependent scores with training and/or experience-dependent influences.

TI CEREBRAL STIMULATION FOLLOWING SUCCINYLCHOLINE IN DOGS
SO ANESTHESIOLOGY
AB The effects of iv succinylcholine (SCh) on the electroencephalogram (EEG), cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metaoblic rate (CMRO2), intracranial pressure (ICP), central venous pressure (CVP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were tested in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Six dogs were maintained at 0.87 .+-. 0.00% (mean .+-. SE) expired halothane (1.0 MAC) and received both SCh 1.0 mg .cntdot. kg-1 and lactated Ringer''s solution placebo 0.05 ml .cntdot. kg-1. Fasciculations began 24 .+-. 4 s after iv SCh. Fasciculations were followed by immediate EEG arousal in five of six dogs and increases in CBF in all six. Average CBF was 151 .+-. 14% of control for the 0-15 min measurement period and 127 .+-. 7% of control for the 15-30 min period. Both were significantly greater than pre-SCh control values and placebo group values. Peak CBF of 177 .+-. 19% of control occurred 3 min after iv SCh and was accompanied by a peak ICP of 435 .+-. 131% of control. ICP values were significantly different between SCh and placebo treatments only during the periods of greatest CBF (1 to 5 min after iv SCh). Average PaCO2 values after iv SCh were significantly greater than pre-SCh control values and placebo values during each 15-min measurement interval. Average PaCO2 was 116 .+-. 2% of control during the 0-15 min measurement period, 114 .+-. 2% of control during the 15-30 min period, and 109 .+-. 1% of control during the 30-45 min period. CVP, MAP, and CMRO2 did not significantly change after iv SCh. In two dogs maintained at 1.32 .+-. 0.01% expired halothane (1.5 MAC), SCh 1.0 mg .cntdot. kg-1 produced PaCO2 changes comparable with those in dogs maintained at 1.0 MAC halothane without comparable changes in CBF, ICP, or EEG. In an additional two dogs receiving pancuronium 0.2 mg .cntdot. kg-1 and 1.0 MAC halothane, SCh had no meaningful effect on any variable measured. The authors conclude that iv SCh increased ICP in the dog secondary to increases in CBF. They hypothesize that the CBF increases are related primarily to SCh-induced increases in afferent muscle spindle activity and secondarily to increases in PaCO2.

TI Prospective evaluation of clinical and laboratory effects of intrathecal
   chemotherapy on children with acute leukemia
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY
AB The objective of this prospective 18-month study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory effects of repeated intrathecal injections of chemotherapy in children with acute leukemia. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia, and complications were prospectively recorded. Laboratory measurements included lumbar puncture opening pressure, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) chemistry, and cell count and morphology. Central venous pressure and ophthalmologic examinations were also performed. Forty-seven children underwent 247 intrathecal injections of chemotherapy. Adverse effects (13.7% of the procedures) included nausea and vomiting, back pain, and headache. One child each had transient cauda equina syndrome, transient communicating hydrocephalus, and persistent sacral plexus injury. The mean lumbar puncture opening pressure was significantly higher after intrathecal therapy than before (22 +/- 8 vs. 15 +/- 9 cut H2O, P = 0.02) and higher than reported in age-matched children without leukemia. All CSF chemistries, cell count, and morphology were normal. The overall incidence of complications was 13.7%. Most were mild and resolved quickly, but significant neurologic complications did occur. Lumbar puncture opening pressure was significantly higher in children with acute leukemia after intrathecal chemotherapy.

TI Estimation of venous sinus pressure drop in patients with idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension using 4D-flow MRI
SO EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
AB Objective We aimed to explore a non-invasive estimate of pressure drop in patients who undergo venous sinus stenting to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Methods This prospective study included 28 IIH patients scheduled for venous stenting. 4D-flow MRI was acquired 24-48 h before venous manometry. Manometry-obtained pressure drop (Mp) was dichotomized into low (Lp: 0-8 mmHg) and high (Hp: 8-30 mmHg) groups. Hemodynamic indices were compared between Lp and Hp. Trans-stenotic pressure drop was estimated by work-energy equation, simplified Bernoulli equation, vorticity magnitude, and velocity difference between inlet and outlet and was compared with Mp. Measurement agreement, correlation, and accuracy were evaluated using the kappa coefficient, Pearson's r, and confusion matrix-derived accuracy. Results Among 28 patients (mean age 38.8 +/- 12.7), 19 (67.9%) were female. Work-energy equation-estimated pressure drop (WEp) had strong correlation (r = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-0.96, p < 0.001) and high agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78-0.95, p < 0.001) with Mp. WEp classified Lp and Hp with an accuracy of 0.96. The kappa value between WEp and Mp was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.78-1.00). In the work-energy equation, the viscosity energy term (V-e) had the largest weights, and the ratio of V-e to the summation of the three energy terms was 0.93 +/- 0.07. V-e had strong correlation with mVort (r = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.85-0.97, p < 0.001), and mean vorticity magnitude was significantly elevated in Hp compared to that in Lp (259.8 vs. 174.9 mL/s, p < 0.001). Conclusion Trans-stenotic pressure drop in IIH can be estimated using the work-energy equation with favorable accuracy.

TI Intra-abdominal Hypertension and Abdominal Compartment Syndrome
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES
AB Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), also referred to as intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), affects organ function in critically ill patients and may lead to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Although initially described in surgical patients, IAH and ACS also occur in medical patients without abdominal conditions. IAP can be measured easily and reliably in patients through the bladder using simple tools. The effects of increased IAP are multiple, but the kidney is especially vulnerable to increased IAP because of its anatomic position. Although the means by which kidney function is impaired in patients with ACS is incompletely elucidated, available evidence suggests that the most important factor involves alterations in renal blood flow. IAH should be considered as a potential cause of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients; its role in other conditions, such as hepatorenal syndrome, remains to be elucidated. Because several treatment options (both medical and surgical) are available, IAH and ACS should no longer be considered irrelevant epiphenomena of severe illness or critical care. An integrated approach targeting IAH may improve outcomes and decrease hospital costs, and IAP monitoring is a first step toward dedicated IAH management. IAH prevention, most importantly during abdominal surgery but also during fluid resuscitation, may avoid ACS altogether. However, when ACS occurs and medical treatment fails, decompressive laparotomy is the only option. Am J Kidney Dis. 57(1): 159-169. (C) 2010 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

TI Assessment of Reversibility of Transverse Venous Sinus Stenosis in
   Patients With Papilledema
SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Background:Bilateral transverse venous sinus stenosis (TVSS) or stenosis of a dominant venous sinus has been found to be very sensitive radiological findings in patients with intracranial hypertension (IH), yet there is still an ongoing debate whether they constitute reversible or permanent phenomena. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the reversibility of TVSS in patients with IH, including conservatively treated patients with signs of IH as defined by the presence of papilledema.Methods:This was a retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with IH between 2016 and 2022, assessed from 2 tertiary university-affiliated neuro-ophthalmology practices. Inclusion criteria were the presence of papilledema, as quantified by optical coherence tomography, and bilateral TVSS, which is considered typical of IH on neuroimaging. During follow-up, included patients must have had confirmation of papilledema resolution as well as subsequent neuroimaging after conservative treatment or cerebrospinal fluid flow diversion. Patients with dural sinus vein thrombosis or intrinsic stenosis from sinus trabeculations or significant arachnoid granulations were excluded from the study. Either CT venography or MRI/MR venography was reviewed by a fellowship-trained neuroradiologist, and the degree of stenosis was scored through the combined conduit score (CCS), as described by Farb et al. The primary outcome was to assess TVSS changes after resolution or improvement of papilledema.Results:From 435 patients, we identified a subset of 10 who satisfied all inclusion criteria. Our cohort comprised entirely women with a median age of 29.5 years and a median BMI of 32.5 kg/m2. Treatment consisted of acetazolamide in 7 patients, of which 1 had additional topiramate and 2 underwent cerebrospinal fluid flow diversion. Furthermore, 6 patients demonstrated significant weight loss during follow-up. For the primary outcome, 5 of 10 patients exhibited no appreciable TVSS change, and 5 patients demonstrated significant improvement in TVSS, of which 4 received conservative treatment only. Papilledema resolution or improvement was statistically significantly associated with increasing average CCS, TVSS diameter, and grade.Conclusions:We were able to demonstrate that TVSS can be both irreversible and reversible in patients with resolved papilledema. The finding of TVSS reversibility from conservative treatment alone is novel and has important implications to optimize patient care. Future studies should work to identify factors associated with irreversible TVSS for subsequent targeted intervention and prevention.

AB Preclinical safety and efficacy evaluation of a novel bioartificial liver support system (BLSS) was conducted using a D-galactosamine canine liver failure model, The BLSS houses a suspension of porcine hepatocytes In a hollow fiber cartridge with the hepatocytes on one side of the membrane and whole blood flowing on the other. Porcine hepatocytes harvested by a collagenase digestion technique were infused into the hollow fiber cartridge and incubated for 16 to 24 hours prior to use. Fifteen purpose-bred male hounds, 1-3 years old, 25-30 kg, were administered a lethal dose, 1.5 g/kg, of D-galactosamine. The animals were divided into three treatment groups: (Ib) no BLSS treatment (n = 6); (2b) BLSS treatment starting at 24-26 h post D-galactosamine (n = 5); and (2c) BLSS treatment starting at 16-18 h past D-galactosamine (n = 4). While maintained under isoflurane anesthesia, canine supportive care was guided by electrolyte and invasive physiologic monitoring consisting of arterial pressure, central venous pressure, extradural intracranial pressure (ICP), pulmonary artery pressure, urinary catheter, and end-tidal CO2, All animals were treated until death or death-equivalent (inability to sustain systolic blood pressure > 80 mmHg for 20 minutes despite massive fluid resuscitation and/or dopamine administration), or euthanized at 60 hours, All animals developed evidence of liver failure at 12-24 hours as evidenced by blood pressure lability, elevated ICP, marked hepatocellular enzyme elevation with microscopic massive hepatocyte necrosis and cerebral edema, elevated prothrombin time, and metabolic acidosis. Groups 2b and 2c marginally prolong survival compared with Group Ib (pairwise log rank censored survival time analysis, p = 0.096 and p = 0.064, respectively). Since survival times for Groups 2b and 2c are not significantly different (p = 0.693), the groups were combined for further statistical analysis. Survival times for the combined active treatment Groups 2b and 2c are significantly prolonged versus Group Ib (p = 0.047). These results suggest the novel BLSS reported here can have a significant impact on the course of liver failure in the D-galactosamine canine liver failure model. The BLSS is ready for Phase I safety evaluation in a clinical setting.

TI Evaluation of equiosmolar 20% mannitol, 3% hypertonic saline and 8.4%
   sodium bicarbonate on intraoperative brain relaxation and hemodynamic
   parameters in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial tumors:
   a prospective randomized study
SO MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
AB BACKGROUND: Research comparing 20% mannitol, 3% hypertonic saline and 8.4% sodium bicarbonate for intro-operative hyperosmolar therapy during supratentorial tumor excision is sparse. With the hypothesis that equiosmolar concentration of these agents will produce equivalent effects, this study was conducted to compare the effects on intraoperative brain relaxation and hemodynamics.
   METHODS: The prospective study was conducted over a period of one year. Ninety patients, aged 18-60 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II with supratentorial tumor and scheduled for surgery were randomized into three groups to receive equiosmolar 20% mannitol (group 1). 3% hypertonic saline (group 2) and 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (group 3). Primary outcome assessed was the effect on intraoperative brain relaxation score while hemodynamic parameters, changes in arterial blood gas parameters, serum electrolytes, serum osmolarity, urine output, fluid intake, post-operative course, hospital stay were the secondary outcomes.
   RESULTS: Demographic characteristics, surgical and anesthetic variables, were comparable between the three groups. Brain relaxation scores were significantly better in group 3 compared to group 2 and group 1 respectively. Patients in group 1 had lower mean blood pressure and central venous pressure values, higher urine output, fluid intake compared to other groups. Patients of group 3 had significantly higher pH, bicarbonate. partial pressure of carbon dioxide, serum sodium and serum osmolarity values compared to groups 1 and 2.
   CONCLUSIONS: Eight point four percent sodium bicarbonate solution infusion is associated with superior intraoperative brain relaxation scores and improved haemodynamic stability compared to equiosmolar 3% hypertonic saline solution and 20% mannitol.

TI Case series of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in three patients
   with immune-complex glomerulonephritis
SO BMC NEUROLOGY
AB Background Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is defined by an increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the absence of inflammation, structural obstructions, or mass lesions. Although the underlying pathogenesis of IIH is not fully understood, associations with specific risk factors as obesity, obstruction of cerebral venous sinuses, medications, endocrine or systemic conditions and chronic kidney disease have been described. Immune-complex glomerulonephritis as IgA-nephropathy is a frequent cause of chronic kidney failure, which was reported previously in one IIH patient. To date, there is no knowledge about the variable relation of immune-complex nephritis, kidney function and the course of IIH. Case presentation We report three cases (two females) of concurrent diagnosis of IIH and immune-complex glomerulonephritis. All patients presented with typical IIH symptoms of headache and visual disturbances. Two patients had been diagnosed with IgA-nephropathy only few weeks prior to IIH diagnosis. The third patient had been diagnosed earlier with terminal kidney failure due to a cryoglobulin glomerulonephritis. Conclusion We propose a possible link between renal deposition of immune-complexes and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Pathophysiological hypotheses and clinical implications are discussed. We recommend clinical awareness and further systematic research to obtain more information on the association of IIH and immune-complex glomerulonephritis.

TI Is venous congestion associated with reduced cerebral oxygenation and
   worse neurological outcome after cardiac arrest?
SO CRITICAL CARE
AB Background: Post-cardiac arrest (CA) patients are at risk of secondary ischemic damage in the case of suboptimal brain oxygenation during an ICU stay. We hypothesized that elevated central venous pressures (CVP) would impair cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (venous cerebral congestion). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between CVP, cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO(2)) as assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and outcome in post-CA patients.
   Methods: This was an observational study in 48 post-CA patients with continuous CVP and SctO(2) monitoring during therapeutic hypothermia.
   Results: The relationship between CVP and mean SctO(2) was best described by an S-shaped, third-degree polynomial regression curve (SctO(2) = -0.002 x CVP3 + 0.08 x CVP2 -1.07 x CVP + 69.78 %, R-2 0.89, n = 1,949,108 data points) with high CVP (> 20 mmHg) being associated with cerebral desaturation. Multivariate linear regression revealed CVP to be a more important determinant of SctO2 than mean arterial pressure (MAP) without important interaction between both (SctO(2) = 0.01 x MAP -0.20 x CVP + 0.001 x MAP x CVP + 65.55 %). CVP and cardiac output were independent determinants of SctO(2) with some interaction between both (SctO(2) = 1.86 x CO -0.09 x CVP -0.05 x CO x CVP + 60.04 %). Logistic regression revealed that a higher percentage of time with CVP above 5 mmHg was associated with lower chance of survival with a good neurological outcome (cerebral performance category (CPC) 1-2) at 180 days (OR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.92-1.00, p = 0.04). In a multivariate model, the negative association between CVP and outcome persisted after correction for hemodynamic variables, including ejection fraction and MAP.
   Conclusions: Elevated CVP results in lower brain saturation and is associated with worse outcome in post-CA patients. This pilot study provides support that venous cerebral congestion as indicated by high CVP may be detrimental for post-CA patients.

TI Cerebral hemodynamics and optic nerve sheath diameter acquired via
   neurosonology in critical patients with severe coronavirus disease:
   experience of a national referral hospital in Peru
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Aim: We aimed to describe the neurosonological findings related to cerebral hemodynamics acquired using transcranial Doppler and to determine the frequency of elevated ICP by optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement in patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hospitalized in the intensive care unit of a national referral hospital in Peru. Methods: We included a retrospective cohort of adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure within the first 7 days of mechanical ventilation under deep sedoanalgesia, with or without neuromuscular blockade who underwent ocular ultrasound and transcranial Doppler. We determine the frequency of elevated ICP by measuring the diameter of the optic nerve sheath, choosing as best cut-off value a diameter equal to or >5.8 mm. We also determine the frequency of sonographic patterns obtained by transcranial Doppler. Through insonation of the middle cerebral artery. Likewise, we evaluated the associations of clinical, mechanical ventilator, and arterial blood gas variables with ONSD >= 5.8 mm and pulsatility index (PI) >= 1.1. We also evaluated the associations of hemodynamic findings and ONSD with mortality the effect size was estimated using Poisson regression models with robust variance. Results: This study included 142 patients. The mean age was 51.39 +/- 13.3 years, and 78.9% of patients were male. Vasopressors were used in 45.1% of patients, and mean arterial pressure was 81.87 +/- 10.64 mmHg. The mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) was elevated (54.08 +/- 16.01 mmHg). Elevated intracranial pressure was seen in 83.1% of patients, as estimated based on ONSD >= 5.8 mm. A mortality rate of 16.2% was reported. In the multivariate analysis, age was associated with elevated ONSD (risk ratio [RR] = 1.07). PaCO2 was a protective factor (RR = 0.64) in the cases of PI >= 1.1. In the mortality analysis, the mean velocity was a risk factor for mortality (RR = 1.15). Conclusions: A high rate of intracranial hypertension was reported, with ONSD measurement being the most reliable method for estimation. The increase in ICP measured by ONSD in patients with severe COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation is not associated to hypercapnia or elevated intrathoracic pressures derived from protective mechanical ventilation.

TI A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis on
   intra-abdominal hypertension in critically ill patients: the wake-up
   project World initiative on Abdominal Hypertension Epidemiology, a
   Unifying Project (WAKE-Up!)
SO MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA
AB Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), defined as a pathologically increase in intraabdominal pressure, is commonly found in critically ill patients. While IAH has been associated with several abdominal as well as extra-abdominal conditions, few studies have examined the occurrence of IAH in relation to mortality. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the prognostic role of IAH and its risk factors at admission in critically ill patients across a wide range of settings and countries. An individual patient meta-analysis of all available data and a systematic review of published (in full or as abstract) medical databases and studies between 1996 and June 2012 were performed. The search was limited to "clinical trials" and "randomized controlled trials", "adults", using the terms "intra-abdominal pressure", "intraabdominal hypertension" combined with any of the terms "outcome" and "mortality". All together data on 2707 patients, representing 21 centers from 11 countries was obtained. Data on 1038 patients were not analysed because of the following exclusion criteria: no IAP value on admission (N.=712), absence of information on ICU outcome (N.=195), age <18 or >95 years (N.=131). Data from 1669 individual patients (19 centers from 9 countries) were analyzed in the meta-analysis. Presence of IAH was defined as a sustained increase in IAP equal to or above 12 mmHg. At admission the mean overall IAP was 9.9 +/- 5.0 mmHg, with 463 patients (27.7%) presenting IAH with a mean IAP of 16.3 +/- 3.4 mmHg. The only independent predictors for IAH were SOFA score and fluid balance on the day of admission. Five hundred thirteen patients (30.8%) died in intensive care. The independent predictors for intensive care mortality were IAH, SAPS II score, SOFA score and admission category. This systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis shows that IAH is frequently present in critically ill patients and it is an independent predictor for mortality.

TI Skull vault growth in craniosynostosis
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Background: Since its first description by Virchow, the principle of abnormal skull growth due to restriction of skull growth at the fused sutures, and the realisation by Moss that the sutures at the skull base are equally affected, have been the main intellectual driving forces behind the majority of cranial expansion procedures performed currently in children with craniosynostosis. Current observations: Despite original impressions that craniosynostosis leads to craniostenosis, many studies have demonstrated that in the majority of patients with craniosynostosis there is normal skull volume in those over the age of 6 months. In Apert syndrome, skull volume is invariably larger than normal. Some studies have shown that intracranial pressure is independent of intracranial volume, and can exist in the presence of normal volume, or indeed after cranial expansion. These observations imply that cranial expansion procedures create a state of artificially increased skull volume, in the quest to improve appearance and function. Future advances: This creates a new angle of view through which skull growth abnormalities are seen. It is becoming clearer that in most patients with craniosynostosis, there is regional imbalance of skull growth, which co-exists with a variety of other equally important factors, such as genetic defects, raised intracranial pressure, venous hypertension, and other brain parenchymal anomalies such as hindbrain hernia or hydrocephalus. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the type of surgical treatment currently practised in most cases is conceptually incorrect. Recent modifications such as the use of springs or distraction do not escape from the underlying philosophy of cranial expansion. With that in mind, it is hoped that advances in the fields of genetics and molecular biology will provide treatments for the cause of craniosynostosis rather than the symptomatic relief that surgery offers currently. Conclusion: Until then, there is a need to develop better ways of quantifying regional abnormalities of skull growth.

TI THE EFFECTS OF ANESTHETICS AND PACO2 ON THE CEREBROVASCULAR, METABOLIC,
   AND ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC RESPONSES TO NITROUS-OXIDE IN THE RABBIT
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB The effects of nitrous oxide (N2O) on cerebral blood flow and metabolism, intracranial pressure (ICP), the electroencephalogram etc. has been well described, at least when N2O is used alone. However, during neurosurgical procedures, N2O is almost always given in combination with either volatile or intravenous agents, and generally after the institution of some degree of hypocarbia. Unfortunately, the modifying influence of such interventions are not well known, and, therfore, the cerebral effects of 70% N2O were studied in rabbits anesthetized with either 1 MAC halothane or isoflurane, or with a fentanyl/pentobarbital combination, during both normocarbia (PaCO2 .apprxeq. 40 mm Hg) and hypocarbia (PaCO2 .apprxeq. 20 mm Hg). Cortical cerebral blood flow (CBFc) and sagittal blood flow (CBFss.sbd.as and index of "global" forebrain flow) were measured using the hydrogen clearance method. Cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) was calculated, and intracranial pressure (ICP), central venous pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and the EEG were also recorded. CBFc during normocarbic halothane, isoflurane,and fentanyl-pentobarbital anesthesia was 69 .+-. 23, 41 .+-. 16, 53 .+-. 26 ml .cntdot. 100g-1 .cntdot. min-1 (mean .+-. SD) respectively, with a significant difference between halothane and isoflurane. The addition of 70% N2O to all three anesthetics significantly increased CBFc by 32%, 34% and 36% respectively during normocarbia and by 47%, 65% ad 27% during hypocarbia. A similar pattern was seen for CBFss. There were no significant differences in the response to N2O based either on anesthetic or PaCO2, except that the increase in CBFss produced by N2O during normocarbic fentanyl-pentobabital anesthesia (10%) was less than that noted during normocarbic halothane anesthesia (39%). CMRO2 was not changed by addition of N2O regardless of anesthetic or PaCO2. N2O increased ICP under all conditions; the increments were small (about 1 mm Hg). The greatest EEG changes in responses to N2O were seen in haothane-anesthetized animals (a decrease in amplitude and increase in frequency). In contrast, no consistent EEG changes were seen with N2O in the fentanyl/pentobarbital group, while the only effect observed in the presence of isoflurane was the disappearance of the typical burst-suppression pattern. We conclude that N2O increases CBF in ICP with each of the three background anesthetics during both normocarbia and hypocarbia. The magnitude of this response to N2O may be less during a fentanyl/barbiturate based anesthetic. These changes were not associated with alterations in CMRO2, suggesting that N2O may be a direct cerebral vasodilator in this species.

TI Personalizing blood pressure management in septic shock
SO ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE
AB This review examines the available evidence for targeting a specific mean arterial pressure ( MAP) in sepsis resuscitation. The clinical data suggest that targeting an MAP of 65-70 mmHg in patients with septic shock who do not have chronic hypertension is a reasonable first approximation. Whereas in patients with chronic hypertension, targeting a higher MAP of 80-85 mmHg minimizes renal injury, but it comes with increased risk of arrhythmias. Importantly, MAP alone should not be used as a surrogate of organ perfusion pressure, especially under conditions in which intracranial, intra-abdominal or tissue pressures may be elevated. Organ-specific perfusion pressure targets include 50-70 mmHg for the brain based on trauma brain injury as a surrogate for sepsis, 65 mmHg for renal perfusion and >50 mmHg for hepato-splanchnic flow. Even at the same MAP, organs and regions within organs may have different perfusion pressure and pressure-flow relationships. Thus, once this initial MAP target is achieved, MAP should be titrated up or down based on the measures of organ function and tissue perfusion.

TI Current insights in intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal
   compartment syndrome: open the abdomen and keep it open!
SO LANGENBECKS ARCHIVES OF SURGERY
AB Background and aims The abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is associated with organ dysfunction and mortality in critically ill patients. Furthermore, the deleterious effects of increased IAP have been shown to occur at levels of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) previously deemed to be safe. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of all aspects of this underrecognized pathological syndrome for surgeons.
   Methods and contents This review article will focus primarily on the recent literature on ACS as well as the definitions and recommendations published by the World Society for the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. The definitions regarding increased IAP will be listed, followed by a brief but comprehensive overview of the different mechanisms of organ dysfunction associated with intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). Measurement techniques for IAP will be discussed, as well as recommendations for organ function support in patients with IAH. Finally, surgical treatment and management of the open abdomen are briefly discussed, as well as some minimally invasive techniques to decrease IAP.
   Conclusions The ACS was first described in surgical patients with abdominal trauma, bleeding, or infection, but in recent years ACS has also been described in patients with other pathologies such as burn injury and sepsis. Some of these so-called nonsurgical patients will require surgery to treat their ACS. This review article is intended to provide surgeons with a clear insight into the current state of knowledge regarding IAH, ACS, and the impact of IAP on the critically ill patient.

TI Reversible Malignant Cerebral Edema Following Cranioplasty
SO NEUROLOGY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB A 44-year-old female underwent cranioplasty 6 months after a malignant right MCA stroke. Three hours later, she became unresponsive, with new left-gaze deviation and right-side hemiparesis. CT head showed new right MCA hypodensity and diffuse edema. After aggressive medical management, she returned to baseline. A brain MRI showed no stroke. Malignant cerebral edema after uneventful cranioplasty is a rare and often fatal complication related to sudden intracranial negative pressure and altered cerebral autoregulation. This is a rare case in which a patient developed malignant cerebral edema and status epilepticus after cranioplasty and survived.

TI New Treatment of Vertigo Caused by Jugular Bulb Abnormalities
SO SURGICAL INNOVATION
AB Objective. Jugular bulb abnormalities can induce tinnitus, hearing loss, or vertigo. Vertigo can be very disabling and may need surgical treatments with risk of hearing loss, major bleeding or facial palsy. Hence, we have developed a new treatment for vertigo caused by jugular bulb anomalies, using an endovascular technique. Patients. Three patients presented with severe vertigos mostly induced by high venous pressure. One patient showed downbeat vertical nystagmus during the Valsalva maneuver. The temporal-bone computed tomography scan showed a high rising jugular bulb or a jugular bulb diverticulum with dehiscence and compression of the vestibular aqueduct in all cases. Intervention. We plugged the upper part of the bulb with coils, and we used a stent to maintain the coils and preserving the venous permeability. Results. After 12- to 24-month follow-up, those patients experienced no more vertigo, allowing return to work. The 3-month arteriographs showed good permeability of the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb through the stent, with complete obstruction of the upper part of the bulb in all cases. Conclusion. Disabling vertigo induced by jugular bulb abnormalities can be effectively treated by an endovascular technique. This technique is minimally invasive with a probable greater benefit/risk ratio compare with surgery.

TI Postinjury Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: Are We Winning the Battle?
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB Postinjury (primary) abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) was described more than 15 years ago as severe abdominal distension with high peak airway pressures, CO2 retention, and oliguria, which led to unplanned re-exploration after damage-control laparotomy. Later, a more elusive type of ACS was recognized, which develops without abdominal injuries (secondary ACS). Both syndromes were recently characterized, their independent predictors were identified, and preventive strategies were developed to reduce their incidence. Once viewed as a syndrome with almost uniform mortality, systematic preventative strategies and therapeutic efforts have reduced the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of the syndrome. This review was designed to summarize the recent advances in the management of ACS, to classify the currently available evidence, and to identify future directions of research and clinical care.

TI Biophysics of cerebrospinal fluid and shunts
SO TECHNIQUES IN NEUROSURGERY
AB This review considers the production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as they relate to intracranial pressure (ICP) in normal individuals and patients with hydrocephalus. It also considers the physics of various types of shunts used to treat hydrocephalus. The hope is that understanding normal and abnormal CSF flow and the physics of shunts will help physicians select the valve mechanism best suited for individual patients with hydrocephalus. CSF formation is constant over a wide range of ICP. In contrast, CSF absorption depends on ICP. There is no drainage if ICP is less than 5 mm Hg, and the rate of absorption is directly proportional to ICP after the opening pressure is reached. The natural valve is a ventricular-sagittal sinus shunt with an opening pressure of 70 mm H2O. More complicated strategies must be considered because of the effects of siphoning related to the routine use of the peritoneum for the treatment of hydrocephalus. The physics of valve designs commonly used in the United States, as reflected by their pressure-flow characteristics, are described. Hard data from randomized control trials on which to base the selection of one valve compared with another are unavailable. However, specific strategies should be considered in a few conditions, such as posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in the premature newborn in whom valves should be selected based on their ability to drain CSF with high protein and particulate matter and without the need to compensate for siphoning in the small infant. Patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus need valves that have a low opening pressure but that do not lead to extreme low pressure due to siphoning when an erect position is assumed. Finally, patients symptomatic from overdrainage require high-pressure shunts with devices that retard siphoning; they may benefit from valved lumboperitoneal shunts.

AB To our knowledge comparative studies of intracranial pressure (ICP) and degree of cerebral swelling during craniotomy for supratentorial or infratentorial space occupying lesion in children are not available. In this prospective study subdural ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), dural tension, and the degree of cerebral swelling were analysed in supine and prone positioned children Subjected to craniotomy for space occupying lesions.
   Material and method. 48 children with space Occupying tumours were subjected to either isoflurane/nitrous oxide 50% fentanyl (n = 22) or propofol/fentanyl/air/oxygen (n = 26). 25 children were operated supratentorially in supine position, while 23 patients were operated infratentorially in the prone position. subdural ICP, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), and CPP were measured just before opening of the dura. Dural tension was estimated before opening of dura, and the degree of cerebral swelling was estimated after opening of dura.
   Results. The age and weight of children anaesthetised with isoflurane in the prone position were significantly lower than the proporol anaesthetised groups. No significant inter-group differences as regards tumour size, midline shift, rectal temperature, MABP or PaCO2 were found. ICP in prone positioned children averaged 16.9 ram Hg against 9.0 min Hg in supine positioned children (p < 0.001). In prone positioned children the dura was significantly tenser, and the degree of brain swelling after opening of dura was significantly more pronounced. No significant difference as regard ICP was disclosed when isoflurane/nitrous oxide/fentanyl and propofol/fentanyl anaesthetized children were compared, but MABP and CPP were significantly lower in isoflurane anaesthetised children.
   Conclusion. In children with cerebral tumours ICP is higher, and the degree of cerebral swelling more pronounced in the prone-compared with supine positioned children.
   Choice of anaesthesia did not influence ICP, but CPP was significantly lower during isoflurane anaesthesia.

TI Hydrocephalus in children
SO LANCET
AB Hydrocephalus is a common disorder of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) physiology resulting in abnormal expansion of the cerebral ventricles. Infants commonly present with progressive macrocephaly whereas children older than 2 years generally present with signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. The classic understanding of hydrocephalus as the result of obstruction to bulk flow of CSF is evolving to models that incorporate dysfunctional cerebral pulsations, brain compliance, and newly characterised water-transport mechanisms. Hydrocephalus has many causes. Congenital hydrocephalus, most commonly involving aqueduct stenosis, has been linked to genes that regulate brain growth and development. Hydrocephalus can also be acquired, mostly from pathological processes that affect ventricular outflow, subarachnoid space function, or cerebral venous compliance. Treatment options include shunt and endoscopic approaches, which should be individualised to the child. The long-term outcome for children that have received treatment for hydrocephalus varies. Advances in brain imaging, technology, and understanding of the pathophysiology should ultimately lead to improved treatment of the disorder.

AB Objective To study the efficacy of gastric surgery-induced weight loss for the treatment of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC).
   Summary Background Data Pseudotumor cerebri (also called idiopathic intracranial hyper tension), a known complication of severe obesity, is associated with severe headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (GSF) pressures, and normal brain imaging. The authors have found in previous clinical and animal studies that PTC in obese persons is probably secondary to a chronic increase in intraabdominal pressure leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. CSF-peritoneal shunts have a high failure rate, probably because they involve shunting from a high-pressure system to another high-pressure zone. In an earlier study of gastric bypass surgery in eight patients, CSF pressure decreased from 353 +/- 35 to 168 +/- 12 mm H2O at 34 +/- 8 months after surgery, with resolution of headaches in all.
   Methods Twenty-four severely obese women underwent bariatric surgery-23 gastric bypasses and one laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding- 62 +/- 52 months ago for the control of severe obesity associated with PTC. CSF pressures were 324 +/- 83 mm H2O. Additional PTC central nervous system and cranial nerve problems included peripheral visual field loss, trigeminal neuralgia, recurrent Bell's palsy, and pulsatile tinnitus. Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea occurred in one patient. and hemiplegia with homonymous hemianopsia developed as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement in another. There were two occluded lumboperitoneal shunts and another functional but ineffective lumboperitoneal shunt. Additional obesity comorbidity in these patients included degenerative joint disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease,hypertension, urinary stress incontinence, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation, and type II diabetes mellitus.
   Results At 1 year after bariatric surgery, 19 patients lost an average of 45 +/- 12 kg, which was 71 +/- 18% of their excess weight. Their body mass index and percentage of ideal body weight had fallen to 30 +/- 5 kg/m(2) and 133 +/- 22%, respectively. In four patients, less than 1 year had elapsed since surgery. Five patients were lost to follow-up. Surgically induced weight loss was associated with resolution of headache and pulsatile tinnitus in all but one patient within 4 months of the procedure. The cranial nerve dysfunctions resolved in all patients. The patient with CSF rhinorrhea had resolution within 4 weeks of gastric bypass. Of the 19 patients not lost to follow-up, 2 regained weight, with recurrence of headache and pulsatile tinnitus. Additional resolved associated comorbidities were 6/14 degenerative joint disease, 9/10 gastroesophageal reflux disorder, 2/6 hypertension, and all with sleep apnea, hypoventilation, type II diabetes mellitus, and urinary incontinence.
   Conclusions Bariatric surgery is the long-term procedure of choice for severely obese patients with PTC and is shown to have a much higher rate of success than CSF-peritoneal shunting reported in the literature, as well as providing resolution of additional obesity comorbidity. Increased intraabdominal pressure associated with central obesity is the probable etiology of PTC, a condition that should no longer be considered idiopathic.

TI Current status of perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid
   hemorrhage
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (PNSAH) is a distinctive disease, representing SAH centered in perimesencephalic cisterns, with negative angiography findings. In recent years, the number of patients with PNSAH has increased significantly; however, the knowledge of PNSAH is insufficient. Therefore, we performed a review of the literature from a PubMed search and recounted our understanding of PNSAH. In this review, we summarized that current high-resolution computed tomography angiography is an acceptable replacement for digital subtraction angiography to rule out aneurysms in PNSAH with strict criteria. The current hypothesis about the etiology of PNSAH is that there is deep vein rupture from aberrant venous anatomy and increased intracranial venous pressure. PNSAH is associated with mild symptoms and lower rates of hydrocephalus and symptomatic vasospasm. For PNSAH, conservative treatment has been the mainstream treatment. PNSAH has a benign clinical course and an excellent prognosis; in long-term follow-up, re-bleeding and death were uncommon.

TI Addition of terlipressin to initial volume resuscitation in a pediatric
   model of hemorrhagic shock improves hemodynamics and cerebral perfusion
SO PLOS ONE
AB Hemorrhagic shock is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in pediatric trauma. Current treatment based on volume resuscitation is associated to adverse effects, and it has been proposed that vasopressors may be used in the pharmacological management of trauma. Terlipressin has demonstrated its usefulness in other pediatric critical care scenarios and its long half-life allows its use as a bolus in an outpatient critical settings. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the addition of a dose of terlipressin to the initial volume expansion produces an improvement in hemodynamic and cerebral perfusion at early stages of hemorrhagic shock in an infant animal model. We conducted an experimental randomized animal study with 1-month old pigs. After 30 minutes of hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure [MAP]<45 mmHg) induced by the withdrawal of blood over 30 min, animals were randomized to receive either normal saline (NS) 30 mL/kg (n = 8) or a bolus of 20 mcg/kg of terlipressin plus 30 mL/kg of normal saline (TP) (n = 8). Global hemodynamic and cerebral monitoring parameters, brain damage markers and histology samples were compared. After controlled bleeding, significant decreases were observed in MAP, cardiac index (CI), central venous pressure, global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI), left cardiac output index, SvO(2), intracranial pressure, carotid blood flow, bispectral index (BIS), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and increases in systemic vascular resistance index, heart rate and lactate. After treatment, MAP, GEDI, CI, CPP and BIS remained significantly higher in the TP group. The addition of a dose of terlipressin to initial fluid resuscitation was associated with hemodynamic improvement, intracranial pressure maintenance and better cerebral perfusion, which would mean protection from ischemic injury. Brain monitoring through BIS was able to detect changes caused by hemorrhagic shock and treatment.

TI Abdominal compartment syndrome
SO JOURNAL DE CHIRURGIE
AB Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined by the deleterious effects of intraabdominal hypertension (IAH) on the pulmonary, cardiovascular, splanchnic, urinary and central nervous system. Abnormal and sudden increase in the volume of any componenet of the intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal space (occuring postoperatively or subsequent to hemorrhagic trauma, referfusion edema, penumoperitoneum, intestinal distention, acute pancreatitis...) causes IAH. Sustained IAH leads to ACS which if left unrecognized or untreated is always fatal. Measurement of urinary bladder pressure is the best validated technique for diagnosis of IAH. It should be used routinely for minimally invasive surveillance of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in patients with severe thoraco-abdominal trauma or after major abdominal operations. Medical management of IAH is of limited efficacy making expedient surgical decompression the treatment of choice for ACS.
   Surgical decompression of the abdomen and temporary closure is generally recognized as effective in clinically patent ACS but the pressure threshold indicating the need for decompression remains controversial. No data are available from controlled randomized trials and current guidelines are based on the experience of large trauma centers. The few available prospective clinical series report survival rates in the 38 to 71% range after surgical decompression for ACS. These studies are difficult to compare due to methodological features but it would appear that centers using the lowest pressure threshold for decompensation (< 20 mmHg) have the highest survival rates.
   Despite the available physiological arguments, indications for prophylactic temporary abdominal coverage (TAC), e.g. in trauma patients or for early decompression in IAH patients with out clinical ACS, have not been validated in clinical practice. The potential morbidity of decompression procedures, TAC, and subsequent abdominal wall reconstructions require comparative studies of these treatment options with available pharmacological and non-surgical means to lower IAP.

TI Visual changes after space flight: is it really caused by increased
   intracranial tension? A systematic review
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL SCIENCES
AB INTRODUCTION: Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) was linked to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) attributable to the combined effects of microgravity and environmental conditions encountered during spaceflight. Microgravity countermeasures as lower body negative pressure (LBNP) are potential interventions for SANS. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive qualitative analysis of literature contrasting simulation and spaceflight studies, focusing on the pathophysiology of SANS, and highlighting gaps in current knowledge.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We systematically searched PubMed electronic database for English primary research published until February 2019 discussing intracranial changes in spaceflight or simulated microgravity, excluding animal and experimental studies. Two authors screened all the abstracts with a third author resolving disagreements. The full-text manuscripts were analyzed in pilot-tested tables.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Nineteen studies were reviewed; 13 simulation, and two out of six spaceflight studies were prospective. ICP changes were investigated in 11 simulation studies, where eight demonstrated a significant increase in ICP after variable periods of head-down tilt. three showed a significant increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) in conjunction with ICP elevation. With increasing ambient CO2: one showed an increase in IOP without further increase in ICP, while another showed a slight further decrease in ICP. LBNP demonstrated no significant effect on ICP in one and a decrease thereof in another study. After spaceflight, increased ICP on lumbar puncture was demonstrated in five studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to microgravity increases ICP possibly precipitating ocular changes. Whether other factors come into play is the subject of investigation. Further randomized studies and methods of direct ICP measurement during spaceflight are needed.

TI A Physical Model of the Intracranial System for the Study of the
   Mechanisms of the Cerebral Blood Flow Autoregulation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper introduces a novel physical model of the intracranial system, which was built with the specific purpose of gaining a better insight into the fundamental mechanisms involved in the cerebral circulation. Specifically, the phenomena of passive autoregulation of the blood flow and the variation of the intracranial compliance as a function of the mean intracranial pressure have been investigated. The physical model allows to go beyond state-of-the-art mathematical models that are often based on strong assumptions or simplifications on the physical mechanisms governing the cerebral circulation. Indeed, the physical model based on passive components was able to correctly replicate some fundamental mechanisms of the blood flow autoregulation. In particular, it allows to highlight the role of the venous outflow, which behaves as a Starling resistor. The physical model can be employed as a demonstrator for educational purpose and to test the behavior of shunts for the therapy of hydrocephalus.

TI Hemodynamic effects of positive end-expiratory pressure
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
AB Purpose of reviewPositive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is required in the Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome and is a cornerstone of its treatment. Application of PEEP increases airway pressure and modifies pleural and transpulmonary pressures according to respiratory mechanics, resulting in blood volume alteration into the pulmonary circulation. This can in turn affect right ventricular preload, afterload and function. At the opposite, PEEP may improve left ventricular function, providing no deleterious effect occurs on the right ventricle.Recent findingsThis review examines the impact of PEEP on cardiac function with regards to heart-lung interactions, and describes its consequences on organs perfusion and function, including the kidney, gut, liver and the brain. PEEP in itself is not beneficious nor detrimental on end-organ hemodynamics, but its hemodynamic effects vary according to both respiratory mechanics and association with other hemodynamic variables such as central venous or mean arterial pressure. There are parallels in the means of preventing deleterious impact of PEEP on the lungs, heart, kidney, liver and central nervous system.SummaryThe quest for optimal PEEP settings has been a prominent goal in ARDS research for the last decades. Intensive care physician must maintain a high degree of vigilance towards hemodynamic effects of PEEP on cardiac function and end-organs circulation.

TI Casper Versus Precise Stent for the Treatment of Patients with
   Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
SO CLINICAL NEURORADIOLOGY
AB Purpose We hypothesized that due to its specific characteristics, the Casper(TM) RX carotid stent (CP) might be particularly suitable for venous sinus stenting (VSS) in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). To test this theory, we compared it to the commonly used Precise Pro RXTM stent (PP). Methods A total of 15 patients with IIH (median age 28.7 years) were reviewed retrospectively. Technical aspects as well as periinterventional and postinterventional complication rates were examined in patients treated with CP (n = 10) and the PP (n = 5). Improvements in cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure (CSF OP), transstenotic pressure gradient (TSPG) and clinical symptoms were also assessed. Results are shown as percentages and respective P-values. Results Stent delivery was easier and more successful with the CP than the PP (difficult/failed stent delivery 0.0% versus 57.1%). No severe peri- or postinterventional complications or instances of in-stent thrombosis and/or stenosis were observed during follow-up. Improvement of CSF OP and TSPG immediately after VSS as well as at 6-month follow-up were comparable between the CP and PP groups. Both groups showed substantial and similar decreases in intensity and frequency of headache. Almost all patients with other IIH-related symptoms showed either improvement or complete resolution of the symptoms after VSS. All patients who were available for interview (n = 12/15) reported a substantial improvement in quality of life. Conclusion A VSS using the CP seems to be safe and effective. The CP may reduce the risk of difficult or failed stent delivery in patients with challenging intracranial venous anatomy.

TI Transverse Sinus Stenting Reverses Medically Refractory Idiopathic
   Intracranial Hypertension
SO FRONTIERS IN OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Aim To characterise the ophthalmic indications for, and ophthalmic efficacy of, transverse sinus stenting in adults with medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension.Methods A retrospective cohort study was undertaken on a single-author database of 226 successive patients with confirmed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). A total of 32 patients were identified who received a transverse sinus stent for medically refractory disease. This which was defined as visual threat and/or intolerance of maximal medical therapy. Patients with medically refractory disease proceeded to stenting, if found to have a significant transverse sinus stenosis gradient at catheter venography. Visual threat was quantified via the degree of papilledema on optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fibre layer, and via the visual field mean deviation. CSF opening pressure at lumbar puncture and cerebral venous sinus pressure measurements from catheter venography were correlated with the ophthalmic data, noting also intolerance of maximal medical therapy. Complications of stenting were fully assessed.Results Medically refractory IIH was found in 18% of the total cohort of IIH patients. 90% of those with medically refractory disease had a significant transverse sinus stenosis pressure gradient, and 80% proceeded to stenting. The intervention eliminated papilledema in 96% of stented patients, and allowed 81% to cease acetazolamide. The need for a further procedure was low at 6%, and the safety profile was favourable.Conclusions Medically refractory disease in IIH is common (18%), and nearly always associated with a significant transverse sinus stenosis pressure gradient (90%). Endovascular stenting of the stenosis deserves wider uptake as a highly effective, safe, and usually definitive treatment. It safeguards vision by eliminating papilledema (96%), and allows most patients to cease acetazolamide (81%). By analogy with glaucoma, if acetazolamide is the prostaglandin of IIH and CSF diversion the emergency glaucoma filter, stenting is the minimally invasive glaucoma surgery.

TI Neural Vascular Mechanism for the Cerebral Blood Flow Autoregulation
   after Hemorrhagic Stroke
SO NEURAL PLASTICITY
AB During the initial stages of hemorrhagic stroke, including intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, the reflex mechanisms are activated to protect cerebral perfusion, but secondary dysfunction of cerebral flow autoregulation will eventually reduce global cerebral blood flow and the delivery of metabolic substrates, leading to generalized cerebral ischemia, hypoxia, and ultimately, neuronal cell death. Cerebral blood flow is controlled by various regulatory mechanisms, including prevailing arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, arterial blood gases, neural activity, and metabolic demand. Evoked by the concept of vascular neural network, the unveiled neural vascular mechanism gains more and more attentions. Astrocyte, neuron, pericyte, endothelium, and so forth are formed as a communicate network to regulate with each other as well as the cerebral blood flow. However, the signaling molecules responsible for this communication between these new players and blood vessels are yet to be definitively confirmed. Recent evidence suggested the pivotal role of transcriptional mechanism, including but not limited to miRNA, lncRNA, exosome, and so forth, for the cerebral blood flow autoregulation. In the present review, we sought to summarize the hemodynamic changes and underline neural vascular mechanism for cerebral blood flow autoregulation in stroke-prone state and after hemorrhagic stroke and hopefully provide more systematic and innovative research interests for the pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies of hemorrhagic stroke.

TI Prediction of the trans-stenotic pressure gradient with
   arteriography-derived hemodynamic features in patients with idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM
AB The pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is attributed to segmental stenosis of the venous sinus. The current treatment paradigm requires a trans-stenotic pressure gradient of >= 8 mmHg or >= 6 mmHg threshold. This study aimed to develop a machine learning screening method to identify patients with IIH using hemodynamic features. A total of 204 venous manometry instances (n = 142, training and validation; n = 62, test) from 135 patients were included. Radiomic features extracted from five arteriography perfusion parameter maps were selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and then entered into support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The Thr8-23-SVM classifier was created with 23 radiomic features to predict if the pressure gradient was >= 8 mmHg. On an independent test dataset, prediction sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.972, 0.846, 0.919, and 0.980, respectively (95% confidence interval: 0.980-1.000). For the 6 mmHg threshold, thr6-28-SVM incorporated 28 features, and its sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.923, 0.956, 0.935, and 0.969, respectively (95% confidence interval: 0.927-1.000). The trans-stenotic pressure gradient result was associated with perfusion pattern changes, and SVM classifiers trained with arteriography perfusion map-derived radiomic features could predict the 8 mmHg and 6 mmHg dichotomized trans-stenotic pressure gradients with favorable accuracy.

TI Baltic pioneers and the vasopressor response
SO NEUROSURGERY QUARTERLY
AB Pioneering neurosurgeon Ernst von Bergmann (1836-1907) received his medical education at the University of Tartu in Estonia and served as a military surgeon in three major wars. His military experiences directed his attention to the surgical treatment of cranial injury, and he also became interested in the management of nontraumatic central nervous system lesions. At Tartu he and Paul Cramer studied the relations between intracranial pressure and arterial and venous blood pressure. The elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the vasopressor response was an ongoing process involving several equally important actors such as Ernst von Leyden and later Bernard Naunyn and Julius Schreiber in Konigsberg (Kaliningrad) on the Baltic, over a period covering at least half a century. After 24 years in Tartu, von Bergmann left for Berlin, where he was later appointed professor and chairman of surgery. At a time when Lister's aseptic techniques were routinely opposed by many surgeons, von Bergmann fully understood their importance and went one step further, advocating aseptic methods. von Bergmann's contributions included pediatric neurosurgery, surgical treatment of brain abscess and brain tumor, and diagnostic radiography and cerebral localization using careful neurologic examinations and external landmarks. von Bergmann belonged to an exclusive group of transition surgeons who built a solid framework for the forthcoming generation of pure neurologic surgeons, led by Ludvig Puusepp in the east and Harvey Cushing in the west.

AB Object. Hypervolemia and hypertension therapy is routinely used for prophylaxis and treatment of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm at many institutions. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate about the preferred modality (hypervolemia, hypertension, or both), the degree of therapy (moderate or aggressive), and the risk or benefit of hypervolemia, moderate hypertension, and aggressive hypertension in patients following subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   Methods. Monitoring data and patient charts for 45 patients were retrospectively searched to identify periods of hypervolemia, moderate hypertension, or aggressive hypertension. Measurements of central venous pressure, fluid input, urine output, arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and oxygen partial pressure (PO,) in the brain tissue were extracted from periods ranging from 1 hour to 24 hours. For these periods, the change in brain tissue PO, and the incidence of complications were analyzed.
   During the 55 periods of moderate hypertension, an increase in brain tissue PO, was found in 50 cases (90%), with complications occurring in three patients (8%). During the 25 periods of hypervolemia, an increase in brain oxygenation was found during three intervals (12%), with complications occurring in nine patients (53%). During the 10 periods of aggressive hypervolemic hypertension, an increase in brain oxygenation was found during six of the intervals (60%), with complications in five patients (50%).
   Conclusions. When hypervolemia treatment is applied as in this study, it may be associated with increased risks. Note, however, that further studies are needed to determine the role of this therapeutic modality in the care of patients with cerebral vasospasm. In poor-grade patients, moderate hypertension (cerebral perfusion pressure 80-120 mm Hg) in a normovolemic, hemodiluted patient is an effective method of improving cerebral oxygenation and is associated with a lower complication rate compared with hypervolemia or aggressive hypertension therapy.

TI Increases in cardiac output can reverse flow deficits from vasospasm
   independent of blood pressure: A study using xenon computed tomographic
   measurement of cerebral blood flow
SO NEUROSURGERY
AB INTRODUCTION: Vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage remains a management challenge. The accepted treatment involves hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilution therapy. However, there is variation in the application of this treatment. Most authors increase mean arterial pressure (MAP), which can be associated with significant morbidity. Others increase cardiac output (CO). In this study, we examined the relationship between volume status, CO, and MAP and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the setting of vasopasm.
   METHODS: A xenon blood flow tomography-based system was used to quantitate CBF. Sixteen patients with vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage were treated with hypervolemia, phenylephrine to increase MAP, or dobutamine to increase CO. Direct CBF measurements were obtained before and after treatment. A strength of this study is that only one variable (central venous pressure, MAP, or CO) was manipulated in each patient, and the effect of this change was measured immediately.
   RESULTS: With phenylephrine, mean MAP increased from 102.4 to 132.1 mm Hg. In regions of diminished CBF due to vasospasm, mean CBF increased from 19.2 to 33.7 ml/100 g/min. Similarly, dobutamine increased the cardiac index from a mean of 4.1 to 6.0 L/min/m(2) and slightly decreased MAP. CBF increased from a mean of 24.8 to 35.4 ml/100 g/min. Both were statistically significant changes. With hypervolemia, the average central venous pressure increased from a mean of 5.4 to 7.3 cm (HO)-O-2; no changes in mean CBF were noted.
   CONCLUSION: This article reports the first human study that shows with direct measurements the independent influence of CO in the setting of vasospasm. Increases in CO without changes in MAP can elevate CBF. This finding has immediate clinical application because CO manipulation is much safer than increasing MAP. Because both interventions were equally efficacious, our protocol has been changed to augment CO as a first measure. Induced hypertension is reserved for patients in whom this initial treatment fails.

TI Abducens Nerve Paralysis Caused due to Increased Intracranial Pressure:
   A Case Report and Review of Literatures
SO GALEN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Background: Double vision due to abducens nerve palsy in patients with Pseudotumor cerebri is a very rare finding and usually occurs by increasing in intracranial pressure (ICP) and therefore by the effect of pressure on abducens nerve. Case Report: A 21-year-old woman has referred to our clinic with symptoms of the headaches, double vision along with nausea and vomiting lasting for three months, with no history of the disease, drug consumption, and the only clinical findings was weighing about 20 Kg for a recent year. In examination VI nerve palsy of the left eye, papilledema of both eyes was reported. The computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic test for a patient's brain lesions shown normal report. Also, other hormone testing and complete blood count were normal. For the next step patient underwent for lumbar puncture (LP), the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was measured more than 120 CmH2O. According to the findings of the examination, patient diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri and underwent for frequent LP, which during that the headaches and double vision symptoms of patient decreased, which indicates that all signs and symptoms of patients caused by pseudotumor cerebri were due to sudden increase in body weight over the past year. Patient prescribed for Acetazolamide and recommended to lose weight with proper diet. For three months of follow-up, symptoms of increased ICP and papilledema have been cleared. Conclusion: The pseudotumor cerebri is manageable by proper diet, and there is no need for bariatric surgery.

TI Minimally Invasive Approaches to Treating Chemosis of the Eyes from
   Unusual Dural Arteriovenous Fistulae
SO MINIMALLY INVASIVE NEUROSURGERY
AB Chemosis of the eyes is usually attributed to carotid cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulae. Herein, we reviewed unusual cases in which chemosis of the eyes originated from dural ateriovenous fistulae (dAVFs) that were distinctly different from carotid cavernous sinus fistulae. Cases in which ocular symptoms were related to increased intracranial pressure either due to sinus thrombosis or cortical venous drainage without involvement of superior or inferior ophthalmic veins were excluded in this review. Several different types of dural AVFs were associated with chemosis, and these included dAVFs harboring a feeding artery from branches of the external carotid artery directly draining to the superior ophthalmic vein or cavernous sinus via the superior petrous sinus, posterior fossa dAVFs draining via the inferior petrous sinus and cavernous sinus to the ophthalmic vein, a fistula between the ophthalmic artery or branches of the internal carotid artery and inferior ophthalmic vein, or tentorial fistula with a drainage vein to the cavernous sinus via the vein of Galen. This study reviews the symptomatology, treatment options, and cerebrovascular abnormalities observed for these unusual dAVF's with chemosis.

TI Noosa, 2 years later... A critical analysis of recent literature
SO ACTA CLINICA BELGICA
CT 3rd World Congress on Abdominal Compartment Syndrome
CY MAR 22-24, 2007
CL Antwerp, BELGIUM
SP World Soc Abdominal Compartment Syndrome, NiekenhuisNetwerk Antwerpen, Dept Intens Care Med
AB Introduction: Since the second World Congress on the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WCACS) in Noosa 2 years ago, interest and publications on intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and ACS have increased exponentially. This paper aimed to critically review recent publications and put this new data into the context of already acquired knowledge concerning IAH/ACS.
   Methods: A Medline and PubMed search was performed from January 2005 up to now using "intra-abdominal pressure (IAP)", "intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH)", "abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS)" and "decompressive taparotomy" as search items.
   Results: Although consensus definitions of IAH/ACS have been formulated recently, data on awareness are still disconcerting. Several groups refined current IAP measurement techniques and tested new direct IAP measurement devices for use in selected subpopulations. A series of recent publications identified specific patient subpopulations in IAH/ACS, like patients with burns or severe acute pancreatitis, with their specific pathophysiology and therapy. Although many studies already assessed the effect of elevated IAP on regional and micro-circulatory organ perfusion, a number of new publications attempted to unravel the link between elevated IAP and more "downstream" organ function or histology. Finally, therapy for IAH/ACS still reveals more questions than it answers. Global resuscitation does not necessarily equate with organ resuscitation. In fact, fluid-resuscitation may even induce IAH/ACS.
   Conclusions: After publication of consensus guidelines on IAH/ACS, there is an urgent need for human intervention studies and, in parallel, clinically relevant animal models. Given moderately tow incidence of ACS and the complex and interrelated pathologies of the critically ill patient with IAH/ACS, large animal models of pathology-induced IAH/ACS might create the opportunity to gain clinically relevant knowledge on the treatment of IAH/ACS.

TI Cavitation threshold evaluation of porcine cerebrospinal fluid using a
   Polymeric Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar-Confinement chamber apparatus
SO JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS
AB Studies investigating mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) in the military population using experimental head surrogates and Finite Element (FE) head models have demonstrated the existence of transient negative pressures occurring within the head at the contrecoup location to the blast wave impingement. It has been hypothesized that this negative pressure may cause cavitation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and possibly lead to brain tissue damage from cavitation bubble collapse. The cavitation pressure threshold of human CSF is presently unknown, although existing FE studies in the literature have assumed a value of -100 kPa. In the present study, the cavitation threshold of degassed porcine CSF at body temperature (37 degrees C) was measured using a unique modified Polymeric Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus, and compared to thresholds of distilled water at various conditions. The loading pulse generated in the apparatus was comparable to experimentally measured pressures resulting from blast exposure, and those predicted by an FE model. The occurrence of cavitation was identified using high-speed imaging and the corresponding pressures were determined using a computational model of the apparatus that was previously developed and validated. The probability of cavitation was calculated (ISO/TS, 18506) from forty-one experimental tests on porcine CSF, representing an upper bound for in vivo CSF. The 50% probability of cavitation for CSF (-0.467 MPa +/- 7%) was lower than that of distilled water (-1.37 MPa +/- 16%) under the same conditions. The lesser threshold of CSF could be related to the constituents such as blood cells and proteins. The results of this study can be used to inform FE head models subjected to blast exposure and improve prediction of the potential for CSF cavitation and response of brain tissue.

TI Acute neurological injury in pediatric patients with single-ventricle
   congenital heart disease
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS
AB OBJECTIVE Single-ventricle congenital heart disease (CHD) in pediatric patients with Glenn and Fontan physiology represents a unique physiology requiring the surgical diversion of the systemic venous return from the superior vena cava (Glenn) and then the inferior vena cava (Fontan) directly to the pulmonary arteries. Because many of these patients are on chronic anticoagulation therapy and may have right-to-left shunts, arrhythmias, or lymphatic disorders that predispose them to bleeding and/or clotting, they are at risk of experiencing neurological injury requiring intubation and positive pressure ventilation, which can significantly hamper pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output. The aim of this study was to describe the complex neurological and cardiopulmonary interactions of these pediatric patients after acute central nervous system (CNS) injury.
   METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed the records of pediatric patients who had been admitted to a quaternary children's hospital with CHD palliated to bidirectional Glenn (BDG) or Fontan circulation and acute CNS injury and who had undergone intubation and mechanical ventilation. Patients who had been admitted from 2005 to 2019 were included in the study. Clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, cardiovascular and pulmonary data, and intracranial pressure data were collected and analyzed.
   RESULTS Nine pediatric single-ventricle patients met the study inclusion criteria. All had undergone the BDG procedure, and the majority (78%) were status post Fontan palliation. The mean age was 7.4 years (range 1.3-17.3 years). At the time of acute CNS injury, which included traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, and cerebral infarct, the median time interval from the most recent cardiac surgical procedure was 3 years (range 2 weeks-11 years). Maintaining normocarbia to mild hypercarbia for most patients during intubation periods did not cause neurological deterioration, and hemodynamic profiles were more favorable as compared to periods of hypocarbia. Hypocarbia was associated with unfavorable hemodynamics but was necessary to decrease intracranial hypertension. Most patients were managed using low mean airway pressure (MAWP) in order to minimize the impact on preload and cardiac output.
   CONCLUSIONS The authors highlight the complex neurological and cardiopulmonary interactions with respect to partial pressure of arterial CO2 (PaCO2) and MAWP when pediatric CHD patients with single-ventricle physiology require mechanical ventilation. The study data demonstrated that tight control of PaCO2 and minimizing MAWP with the goal of early extubation may be beneficial in this population. A multidisciplinary team of pediatric critical care intensivists, cardiac intensivists and anesthesiologists, and pediatric neurosurgeons and neurologists are recommended to ensure the best possible outcomes.

TI Lung recruitment maneuver in patients with cerebral injury: effects on
   intracranial pressure and cerebral metabolism
SO INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: To investigate the effects of a lung recruitment maneuver on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral metabolism in patients with acute cerebral injury and respiratory failure. Design: Prospective investigation. Setting: Ten-bed intensive care unit of a university hospital. Patients: Eleven patients with acute traumatic or non-traumatic cerebral lesions, who were on mechanical ventilation with acute lung injury. Interventions: Hemodynamics, ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), jugular venous oxygen saturation (SJO(2)), and arterial minus jugular venous lactate content difference (AJDL) were measured before, during and after a volume recruitment maneuver (VRM), which included a 30-s progressive increase in peak pressure up to 60 cmH(2)O and a sustained pressure at the same level for the next 30 s. Results: At the end of VRM, ICP was elevated (16+/-5 mmHg vs 13+/-5 mmHg before VRM, P<0.05) and mean arterial pressure was reduced (75+/-10 vs 86+/-9 mmHg, P<0.01), which resulted in a decrease of CPP (60+/-10 vs 72+/-8 mmHg, P<0.01). SJO(2) deteriorated at the end of the procedure (59+/-7 vs 69+/-6%, P<0.05), AJDL was not altered. In the following period all parameters returned to normal values. An improvement in arterial oxygenation was observed at the end, but not in the period after the maneuver. Conclusions: Our VRM reduced cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism. We conclude that our VRM with high peak pressure effects only a marginal improvement in oxygenation but causes deterioration of cerebral hemodynamics. We therefore cannot recommend this technique for the ventilatory management of brain-injured patients.

TI Treatment of the superior sagittal sinus and transverse sinus thrombosis
   associated with intracranial hemorrhage with the mechanical thrombectomy
   and thrombolytics Case report
SO MEDICINE
AB Rationale: The superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and transverse sinus are the major dural sinuses that receive a considerable amount of venous drainage. The occlusion of them has been suggested to cause intracranial hypertension, hemorrhage, and lead to potentially fatal consequences.
   Patient concerns: We reported a 35-year-old woman with headache presented to our emergency department with a decreased level of consciousness and epileptic seizures. The examination of speech, higher mental function, and cranial nerve were normal. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated both subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage and brain edema at the right temporal lobe accompanied by high density shadow in the right transverse sinus. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed extensive thrombosis of the SSS and bilateral transverse sinus.
   Diagnoses: The SSS and transverse sinus thrombosis, accompanied by right temporal lobe hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
   Interventions: An emergent mechanical thrombectomy by placed Solitair AB stent in the SSS, respectively, passed left and right sigmoid sinus-transverse sinus route. We removed the most clots, DSA revealed recanalization of the SSS and left transverse sinus was seen with normalization of the venous outflow, the occlusion of right transverse sinus was still present. There were 4 hours after patient back to neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU), patient appeared anisocoria (R/L: 4.0/2.5 mm), bilateral light reflexes disappeared, then we took a CT reexamination revealed intraparenchymal hemorrhage increased, brain edema was aggravated at the left temporal lobe, and mild midline shift. Subsequently, we performed decompressive hemicraniectomy and puncture the hematoma supplemented by B ultrasonic. Anticoagulation treatment was initiated 24 hours after surgery, and follow-up DSA showed gradually improved patency in the SSS and bilateral transverse sinus.
   Outcomes: Despite occlusion of the SSS and bilateral transverse sinus, patient's symptoms resolved after the operations and he was discharged without complications.
   Lessons: The favorable clinical outcome after complete occlusion of the SSS and transverse sinus, accompanied by right temporal lobe hemorrhage, SAH has rarely been reported and it might be explained by our timely surgical intervention and development of compensatory cerebral collateral circulation.

TI Anatomical Venous Variants in Children With Cerebral Sinovenous
   Thrombosis
SO STROKE
AB Background and Purpose Literature is sparse on the frequency and significance of anatomical venous variants (AVVs) in pediatric cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT).
   Methods We retrospectively reviewed children with CSVT and controls undergoing computed tomography/magnetic resonance venography from January 2008 to 2014. Clinical features examined included raised intracranial pressure, risk factors, and treatment. Radiological features examined included CSVT location, presence and type of AVVs, hemorrhagic venous infarction, and venous collateralization. Clinical outcome was measured by the pediatric stroke outcome measure and radiological outcome by thrombus recanalization.
   Results Fifty-one children with CSVT were identified. Twenty-two (43%) had AVVs at presentation. Nineteen (86%) had hypoplasia/absence of major dural sinus, 5 (23%) had persistent fetal structures, 3 (14%) had duplications/fenestrations, and 1 (5%) had disconnected superficial and deep venous systems. Controls had a slightly higher but nonsignificant prevalence 26 (51%) of AVVs. No significant clinical and radiological differences were observed between children with CSVT and AVVs compared with those with typical venous anatomy.
   Conclusions AVVs are seen in many children with and without CSVT and do not seem to alter the presentation or clinical course. The influence of these variations on the brain's ability to tolerate venous congestion because of thrombosis merits further study.

TI Efficacy of stenting in patients with cerebral venous sinus
   thrombosis-related cerebral venous sinus stenosis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY
AB Background Venous stenting has been proven to be a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS). However, its use in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis-related CVSS has been less reported.
   Purpose To explore the safety and efficacy of stenting for patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST)-related CVSS.
   Methods The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with CVST-related CVSS received venous stenting in the chronic stage after failed medical treatment were retrospectively evaluated.
   Results A total of 17 patients with CVST-related CVSS were included. Mean pressure gradient across the CVSS decreased from 11.5 +/- 4.2 mmHg prior to stenting to 2.1 +/- 1.1 mmHg post-stenting. Mean CSF opening pressure decreased from 33.1 +/- 5.5 cmH(2)O to 18.7 +/- 1.7 cmH(2)O. Both headache and visual disturbance improved or resolved in 78% and 92% of the patients, respectively. Complications included lethal cerebellar hematoma in one case and bilateral occipital epidural hematoma in another case. One of the patients received retreatment with ventriculo-peritoneal shunting due to recurrent headache.
   Conclusion Restoring the patency of stenotic sinuses with stents in patients of CVST-related CVSS unresponsive to medical therapy in the chronic stage may improve symptoms in the majority of the patients. However, a relatively higher cerebral hemorrhage rate was observed and may be related to this pathology. Stenting in this subgroup of CVSS patients may require further evaluation with a larger and long-term study, and should be used with caution at this time.

TI Role of Decompressive Craniectomy in the Management of Cerebral Venous
   Sinus Thrombosis
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a relatively uncommon cause of stroke more often affecting women and younger individuals. Blockage of the venous outflow rapidly causes edema and space-occupying venous infarctions and it seems intuitive that decompressive craniectomy (DC) can effectively reduce intracranial pressure just like it works for malignant middle cerebral artery infarcts and traumatic brain injury. But because of the relative rarity of this type of stroke, strong evidence from randomized controlled trials that DC is a life-saving procedure is not available unlike in the latter two conditions. There is a possibility that other forms of interventions like endovascular recanalization, thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and anticoagulation, which cannot be used in established middle cerebral artery infarcts and TBI, can reverse the ongoing pathology of increasing edema in CVST. Such interventions, although presently unproven, could theoretically obviate the need for DC when used in early stages. However, in the absence of such evidence, we recommend that DC be considered early as a life-saving measure whenever there are large hemorrhagic infarcts, expanding edema, radiological, and clinical features of impending herniation. This review gives an overview of the etiology and risk factors of CVST in different patient populations and examines the effectiveness of DC and other forms of interventions.

TI Straws Don't Suck: Are Straws Dangerous after Endoscopic Skull Base
   Surgery?
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY PART B-SKULL BASE
AB Objective Patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal surgery have historically been restricted from using straws postoperatively, due to the concern that this activity generates negative pressure. The objective of this study is to evaluate the pressure dynamics in the sinonasal cavity associated with the use of a straw. Methods Intracranial pressure catheters were placed in the nasal cavity of 20 healthy individuals. Pressure measurements were then recorded while participants drank liquids of different viscosities from a cup and from a straw. Measurements were recorded with and without subjects occluding their nose to simulate postoperative nasal obstruction. Results The average pressure in the nasal cavity while drinking water from a cup was -0.86 cmH(2)O, from a straw was -1.09 cmH(2)O, and while occluding the nose and using a straw was -0.81 cmH(2)O. The average pressure in the nasal cavity while drinking a milkshake from a cup was -0.98 cmH(2)O, from a straw was -1.88 cmH(2)O, and while occluding the nose and using a straw was -1.37 cmH(2)O. There was no statistically significant difference in pressure measurements when comparing either task or consistency (p > 0.05). Conclusion Straw use is not associated with the generation of significant negative pressure in the nasal cavity. The pressure generated when drinking from a straw is not significantly different from that of drinking from a cup. This data suggest that straw use may be safe for patients following endoscopic skull base surgery, but further investigation is warranted.

TI New Technique Seeking Prophylaxis in the Displacement of Distal
   Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Catheter - Case Report
SO BRAZILIAN NEUROSURGERY-ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE NEUROCIRURGIA
AB Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a comorbidity treated in neurosurgical practice today with the ventriculoperitoneal derivation technique. However, despite its great safety and efficacy, this technique is susceptible to infrequent failures, such as displacement of the catheter leading to the need for reoperation. In the present article, we report a case involving a peritoneal catheter tip retropulsion for subcutaneous tissue in an obese patient with posterior correction using an extending connector to the distal catheter, without harming the drainage flow. In our case report, the patient went on without complications and without the occurrence of new displacement after 8 months of surgery. The results obtained by this technique supported the idea that this alternative construction minimizes the risk of displacement of the peritoneal tip catheter in obese patients and with high intra-abdominal pressure, helping to reduce the need for reoperations. In addition, the present case report supports the need for further studies and clinical trials on the subject.

TI Remote Cerebellar Hemorrhage Following Surgery for Supratentorial
   Lesions
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Remote cerebellar hemorrhage (RCH) after intracranial surgery is a rare complication. Cerebellar hemorrhage is the most commonly described remote site hemorrhage after surgery for supratentorial pathologies. Although this is a rare complication 0.04% to 0.8%, it can be devastating in terms of patient outcome. There are various hypotheses to explain the occurrence of RCH. We report 6 cases of RCH after surgery for supratentorial lesions, discuss the pathophysiology, and review the pertinent literature.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of patients who underwent surgery for supratentorial lesions at our center between 2015 and 2017. We identified 6 patients who developed RCH among 1200 patients who underwent surgery and reviewed the demographic data, diagnosis, surgical procedure, and final outcome.
   RESULTS: A total of 1200 patients underwent surgery for supratentorial pathologies between 2015 and 2017. Six patients developed RCH (incidence, 0.5%); 5 were male and 1 was female, with a mean age of 46.4 years. One patient underwent suboccipital decompression for RCH; the rest 5 were managed with close observation and serial imaging. The Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) of 5 was observed in 4 patients, GOS of 4 in 1 patient at discharge, and GOS of 1 in 1 patient who succumbed to severe pulmonary infection after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: RCH is a rare complication but can lead to catastrophic results. Loss of large volumes of cerebrospinal fluid or sudden alteration in intracranial pressure due to removal of a mass lesion is the likely etiology. Although majority of cases may be managed conservatively, in a subset of cases with neurologic deterioration, surgery may be required as a life-saving procedure.

TI CEREBRAL HEMODYNAMIC-EFFECTS OF FLUID RESUSCITATION IN THE PRESENCE OF
   AN EXPERIMENTAL INTRACRANIAL MASS
SO SURGERY
AB We addressed the impact on intracranial pressure (ICP) of posthemorrhage fluid resuscitation with a protocol in which additional fluid was infused to maintain a stable cardiac output after an initial bolus of fluid was infused.  Anesthetized, mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs (n = 27) underwent a 30-minute interval of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure = 55 mm Hg) during which inflation of a subdural balloon maintained ICP at 15 mm Hg.  After shock, animals were resuscitated with one of four randomly assigned fluids:  (1) slightly hypotonic crystalloid (Na+, 125 mEq . L-1; designated Na-125); (2) hypertonic crystalloid (Na+, 250 mEq . L-1; designated Na-250); (3) slightly hypotonic crystalloid plus 10% pentastarch (Na-125P); or (4) hypertonic crystalloid plus 10% pentastarch (Na-250P).  Supplemental fluid was administered as needed to maintain cardiac output comparable to baseline values.  ICP increased progressively in all fluid groups during resuscitation.  Cerebral blood flow, measured by the cerebral venous outflow method, increased immediately after resuscitation and then declined steadily over time in all groups.  Fluids containing pentastarch maintained hemodynamic stability with minimal supplementation throughout most of the postresuscitation period, compared with crystalloid alone, which required substantial additional volume.  If decreased intracranial compliance and hemorrhage are combined, ongoing resuscitation is associated with significantly increased ICP and significantly decreased cerebral blood flow, independent of the tonicity and oncotic pressure of the infused fluid.

TI Valsalva-triggered pseudotumor cerebri syndrome Case series and
   pathogenetic implications
SO NEUROLOGY
AB Objective
   To report the clinical and radiologic features of 3 patients in whom prolonged vigorous coughing/Valsalva triggered the development of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS) that persisted even after the coughing attacks had stopped and to discuss how this novel proximate trigger supports a "hydraulic model" of PTCS pathogenesis.
   Methods
   This was a retrospective case series of 3 patients seen between January 2011 and July 2017 in a tertiary care neuro-ophthalmology clinic.
   Results
   Three female patients (ages 13, 28, and 21 years) were asymptomatic until developing prolonged fits of profuse coughing. Two patients had upper respiratory tract infections, and 1 patient had a prolonged asthma exacerbation. Symptoms typical of PTCS began 2 weeks into the coughing attacks, and patients were examined 1 to 2 weeks after coughing had ceased. One patient was overweight and 2 were obese. All 3 patients had papilledema, and 1 of 3 patients had lateral rectus palsy. Two of 3 patients had visual field defects, and all 3 patients had dural venous sinus stenoses (DVSS) on venous imaging. Lumbar puncture (LP) confirmed elevated opening pressures in 2 of 3 patients and brought immediate and sustained relief of symptoms; LP attempts failed in the third patient because of body habitus (body mass index 68 kg/m(2)). All patients were given acetazolamide and advised to work on weight loss. At follow-up 3 to 6 months later, all 3 patients had complete remission of their clinical syndromes and resolution of their DVSS on neuroimaging.
   Conclusions
   In susceptible individuals, prolonged coughing/Valsalva can trigger PTCS in the setting of collapsible (nonfixed) DVSS. This new observation supports a hydraulic model of PTCS pathogenesis.

   Protocol and Long-term Outcomes
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY PART B-SKULL BASE
AB Objective We evaluated the long-term outcomes from a single neurosurgeon and otolaryngologist team using a specific operative protocol for repair and postoperative evaluation. Design The charts of patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal repair of meningoencephaloceles (MECs) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks were retrospectively reviewed from 2015 to 2023. Intraoperative steps of the repair and reconstruction were analyzed. Patients' postoperative assessments and complications were analyzed. Setting Loyola University Medical Center's electronic medical record database. Participants Forty-three patients (32 female) aged between 11 and 81 years. Main Outcome Measures Long-term outcomes of patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal repair of MECs and CSF leaks by a single team and protocol. We hypothesized that there would be minimal complications and no recurrences, requiring secondary operation. Results The most common site for MECs was the cribriform plate. Lumbar drain opening pressures ranged from 10 to 35 cm H2O with 18 out of 34 patients having the lumbar drain removed immediately postoperatively. The median hospital stay was 3 days. The average length of follow-up was 3.8 years. No recurrences or secondary operations were noted in all patients. One patient had a sinonasal infection that was successfully treated. Eight patients were noted to have venous stenosis and underwent further evaluation. Conclusion This study represents one of the largest long-term analyses of outcomes by a single team. Our specific protocol for the endoscopic endonasal repair of anterior skull base MECs and CSF leaks is safe and effective. These patients should be evaluated and treated for elevated intracranial pressure following the repair.

TI Post-traumatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis complicated with
   syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: a case report
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
AB BackgroundCerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from the formation of a thrombus in the venous sinuses in the brain, resulting in impaired venous drainage, increased intracranial pressure, and severe neurological deficits. Traumatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but potentially devastating complication of head trauma. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis can present with a variety of symptoms including headache, vomiting, blurred vision, loss of consciousness, seizures, and coma. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is a complication of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis that occurs due to raised intracranial pressure, which in turn stimulates antidiuretic hormone release. The diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is confirmed through neuroimaging. Anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment. The prognosis is variable and depends on several factors including the extent of thrombosis, presence of cerebral hemorrhage, and timing of diagnosis and treatment.Case presentationWe report a case of a 45-year-old Albanian female who presented with headache and dizziness following a fall and head strike in the context of influenza A. Computed tomography of the brain revealed a stable minimally displaced oblique fracture of the left petrous bone and new dural venous sinus thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, and cranial aspect of the left internal jugular vein. Thrombotic, malignancy, and infectious screens were negative. Our case was successfully managed with anticoagulants. Additionally, the patient developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, which was managed with fluid restriction.ConclusionOur case highlights the importance of considering cerebral venous sinus thrombosis as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with dizziness following trauma. Early identification with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging venography and appropriate treatment with anticoagulation therapy are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality.

TI Relationship between hemodynamic parameters and cerebral blood flow
   during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
SO RESUSCITATION
AB Introduction: Cerebral blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a major neuroprognostic factor although not clinically feasible for routine assessment and monitoring. In this context, a surrogate marker for cerebral perfusion during CPR is highly desirable. Yet, cerebral blood flow hemodynamic determinants remain poorly understood and their significance might be altered by changes in head positioning such as flat, head up, and head down during CPR.
   Hypothesis: We hypothesized that routinely measured hemodynamic parameters would correlate with cerebral brain flow during CPR, independently of the head position.
   Methods: Associations between cerebral blood flow, measured using microsphere techniques, and hemodynamic parameters were studied from two prior publications. Eight pigs receiving CPR with an automated device and an impedance threshold device in the flat or supine, whole body head down and whole body head up tilt positions were analysed for the derivation sample. Relevant associations were examined for consistency in an external validation sample consisting of 18 pigs randomized to supine position versus head and torso elevation.
   Results: After adjusting for position, arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure during decompression were significantly associated with cerebral blood flow, in the derivation and the external validation samples. No significant associations were found between cerebral blood flow during CPR and right atrial pressure, intracranial pressure, end tidal CO2, carotid blood flow, and coronary perfusion pressure in the derivation sample.
   Conclusion: Decompression arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure are relevant candidate surrogate markers for cerebral blood flow during CPR, independently of head position.

AB To reevaluate barbiturate therapy in severe head injury, we investigated the effects of barbiturate on intracranial pressure (ICP), jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjO2), and cerebral blood flow (CBF). In 21 patients with severe head injury (GCS of 3 to 8), we introduced barbiturate thernpy under the following conditions: the dose of barbiturate is low (2 mg/kg/h), the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is maintained over 70 mmHg, and the body temperature is precisely controlled (37 degrees C in the bladder). In 12 of 21 cases (57%), ICP was controlled under 25 mmHg by the barbiturate therapy. In these 12 cases, SjO2 and ICP significantly improved, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale 3 months after the injury was GR: 5 cases, MD: 3 cases, SD: 3 cases, and PVS: 1 case. These results suggest that the barbiturate therapy could be effective for severe head injured patients, if the CPP and body temperature are properly maintained during the therapy.

TI CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID DYNAMICS IN INFANTS EVALUATED WITH COLOR DOPPLER US
   AND SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS - RESPIRATORY VERSUS ARTERIAL SYNCHRONIZATION
SO RADIOLOGY
AB PURPOSE: To investigate rapid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in infants in relation to respiration and cardiac cycle.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: CSF-flow signals were detected in 35 of 526 consecutive infants (22 male and 13 female infants, aged 1-30 days) who underwent 140 color Row and pulsed Doppler ultrasonographic studies at the cerebral aqueduct. In infants with spontaneous CSF flow, Doppler spectrum and respiratory signal or electrocardiogram were recorded simultaneously.
   RESULTS: In 64 examinations performed in 20 infants, CSF flow was induced by abdominal pressure change only. Among 76 examinations performed in 15 infants, CSF flow was synchronous to spontaneous respiration in 28 examinations, to mechanical ventilation in nine, to the cardiac cycle in 15, and to both respiratory and heart rates in 24.
   CONCLUSION: Respiration-modulated CSF Row predominates in infants without significant intracranial disease. Pulsation or CSF solely or mainly synchronous to the cardiac cycle is associated with conditions causing increased intracranial pressure.

TI Cough, exertional, and sex headaches
SO AKTUELLE NEUROLOGIE
AB Headaches associated with sexual activity, cough and exertion are rare headache syndromes that show distinct but overlapping clinical features. Here, the current pathophysiological models that have facilitated our understanding of these headache types are reviewed. Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms are yet to be defined, these headaches share the trigger mechanism of raised intra-abdominal pressure, with the sequelae of raised intracranial pressure leading to irritation of pain-sensitive intracranial structures such as the dura mater and venous sinus. The incidence of underlying symptomatic forms such as subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) or Chiari-l-Malformation is relatively high, so the importance of differential diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation of these headaches is discussed. The role of these headaches in the revised headache classification scheme of the international Headache Society (IHS) is considered. in view of recent clinical and experimental data highlighting the clinical spectrum of these headaches, current therapeutic options and prognostic outcome are explored.

TI Endovascular stenting using a sagittal sinus approach for sigmoid sinus
   wall dehiscence related to intractable pulsatile tinnitus: a case series
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
AB Background Sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence can lead to pulsatile tinnitus with a significant decrease in quality of life, occasionally leading to psychiatric disorders. Several surgical and endovascular procedures have been described for resolving dehiscence. Within endovascular procedures, the sagittal sinus approach could be a technical alternative for tracking and accurate stent positioning within the sigmoid sinus when the jugular bulb anatomy is unfavorable.Case presentation A retrospective case series of three patients with pulsatile tinnitus due to sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence without intracranial hypertension was reviewed from January 2018 to January 2022. From the participants enrolled, the median age was 50.3 years (range 43-63), with 67% self-identifying as female and 33% as male. They self-identified as Hispanic. Sigmoid sinus dehiscence was diagnosed using angiotomography, and contralateral transverse sinus stenosis was observed in all patients. Patients underwent surgery via a navigated endovascular sagittal sinus approach for sigmoid sinus stenting. No neurological complications were associated with the procedure. Pulsatile tinnitus improved after the procedure in all patients.Conclusions Superior sagittal sinus resection for sigmoid sinus wall stenting is a safe and effective technique. Pulsatile tinnitus due to sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence could be treated using the endovascular resurfacing stenting technique. However, further research is needed to evaluate the potential benefit of contralateral stenting for removing sinus dehiscence when venous stenosis is detected. However, resurfacing sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence results in symptomatic improvement.

TI A new self adjusting flow-regulating device for shunting of CSF
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB Traditional shunts were primarily designed to manage hydrocephalus by regulating intracranial pressure. However, in some circumstances, their performance characteristics can cause them to underdrain or overdrain CSF. Overdrainage has been linked with clinical complications such as valve-dependent shunt syndrome, cranial stenosis, slit-ventricle syndrome, and subdural hematomas, and it may contribute to ventricular catheter occlusion. In addition to complications associated with hypertension and ventriculomegaly, underdrainage has been linked with residual brain edema, and subcutaneous CSF effusion has been observed at the site of cranial perforation, mainly in pediatric patients. Newer designs attempt to reduce these complications, but fall short for various reasons. The author presents a new shunt design, which utilizes variable aperture technology (patent pending) that results in the physiologic regulation of CSF flow under both positive and negative pressure conditions. This new design offers encouragement for the management of hydrocephalus and the prevention of complications due to overdrainage.

TI Neckties and Cerebrovascular Reactivity in Young HealthyMales: A Pilot
   Randomised Crossover Trial
SO STROKE RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB Background. A necktie may elevate intracranial pressure through compression of venous return. We hypothesised that a tight necktie would deleteriously alter cerebrovascular reactivity. Materials and Methods. A necktie was simulated using bespoke apparatus comprising pneumatic inner-tube with aneroid pressure-gauge. Using a randomised crossover design, cerebrovascular reactivity was measured with the "pseudo-tie" worn inflated or deflated for 5 minutes (simulating tight/loose necktie resp.). Reactivity was calculated using breath hold index (BHI) and paired "t" testing used for comparative analysis. Results. We enrolled 40 healthy male volunteers. There was a reduction in cerebrovascular reactivity of 0.23 units with "tight" pseudotie (BHI loose 1.44 (SD 0.48); BHI tight 1.21 (SD 0.38) P < .001). Conclusion. Impairment in cerebrovascular reactivity was found with inflated pseudo-tie. However, mean BHI is still within a range of considered normal. The situation may differ in patients with vascular risk factors, and confirmatory work is recommended.

TI Intra-abdominal hypertension causes reversible blood-brain barrier
   disruption
SO JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
CT 96th Annual Clinical Congress of the American-College-of-Surgeons (ACS)
CY OCT 03-07, 2010

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) has detrimental effects on organ function and is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. IAH has also been shown to increase intracranial pressure. The exact mechanism is not known. This study tests the effect of an acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mice.
   METHODS: Male CD-1 mice weighing 30 g to 38 g were used. Mice in experimental groups underwent either 4 hours of IAH or 4 hours of IAH followed by 1 hour of decompression (DC). A set of control mice were anesthetized for either 4 hours or 5 hours. Femoral artery cannulation was used for blood pressure monitoring. IAH was induced by intraperitoneal infusion of mineral oil to a pressure of 20 mm Hg. DC was performed through an incision in the anterior abdominal wall. BBB integrity was determined by extravasation of 2% Evans blue (EB) dye administered through the femoral vein 1 hour before the mice were killed. BBB permeability was quantified by the EB extravasation method.
   RESULTS: EB content in brain tissue was higher in the IAH 4-hour group (n = 12) compared with their control group (n = 4; p < 0.05), indicating increased permeability of BBB. In the IAH 4-hour + DC 1-hour group (n = 6), EB content in brain tissue was not significantly higher than their respective control group (n = 6).
   CONCLUSION: IAH of 20 mm Hg in mice for 4 hours caused increased BBB permeability. This endothelial barrier dysfunction is reversed by abdominal DC. (J Trauma. 2012;72: 183-188. Copyright (C) 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)

TI Assessment of Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter in Patients Undergoing
   Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography: A Prospective,
   Randomized, Controlled Double-Blinded Comparison of Propofol and Ketofol
   Anesthesia
SO NIGERIAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB Background: ERCP is an endoscopic procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of biliopancreatic system diseases. An increase in intra-abdominal pressure due to the insufflation of air to the intestinal lumen may be transmitted to ICP through the course of ERCP. In this prospective, randomized, controlled double-blinded study, we aimed to assess the ICP change using ultrasonography measurement of ONSD in patients undergoing ERCP comparing the effects of propofol and ketofol anesthesia. Material/Methods: One hundred and nine patients undergoing ERCP under propofol or ketofol anesthesia were enrolled in the study. Ultrasonography measurement of ONSD was performed before (T0) and immediately after induction of anesthesia (T1), during sphincterotomy (T2), at the end of procedure (T3), and after the patient is fully awake (T4). Results: Comparison of ONSD values and ONSD alteration between groups showed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). Both groups showed significantly greater changes from T0 to T2 compared with values from T0 to T1, T3, and T4, respectively (P = 0,000). T0 to T3 alteration was also significantly greater than T0 to T1 and T4 change in both groups (P = 0,000). Conclusions: ERCP procedure increases intracranial pressure most prominently during sphincterotomy both under propofol or ketofol anesthesia. Further studies are needed to investigate the impact of this phenomenon on adverse clinical outcomes.

TI Extension of intracranial thrombosis after unilateral dissection of the
   internal jugular vein
SO ARCHIVES OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY
AB Objective: Resection of the internal jugular vein can be necessary in cases of radical neck dissection or even in cases involving benign neoplasms such as glomus tumors. According to the triad described by Virchow (ie, stasis of blood flow, damage to the endothelium, and changes in hemostasis), the development of a thrombosis in the venous vessels superior to the resected internal jugular vein seems to be possible. The aim of this study was to determine the extension of possible intracranial thrombosis after wound healing.
   Design: A total of 17 patients requiring resection of the internal jugular vein were evaluated prospectively using magnetic resonance imaging and 2-dimensional (time-of-flight) magnetic resonance angiography after the surgical treatment. Preoperative magnetic resonance images were obtained in all 17 patients for staging purposes as well as to exclude preoperative thrombosis of the internal jugular vein. Sixteen patients had malignant tumors, and I patient had a glomus tumor.
   Results: Intracranial thrombosis with thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus was found in 4 patients, and thrombosis of the transverse sinus was found in 3 patients. There were no complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or signs of increased intracranial pressure in any patients. There was no evidence of intracranial thrombosis in 10 cases. In these cases, thrombosis of the venous vessels superior to the resected vein ranged from none to complete thrombosis of the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. After unilateral resection of the internal jugular vein, the venous blood leaves the brain mainly via the venous network of the contralateral side of the neck.
   Conclusions: Although intracranial thrombosis of the sigmoid or transverse sinus seems to occur more frequently than was previously thought, intracranial complications such as venous infarction or increased intracranial pressure appear to be very rare. After unilateral radical neck dissection, the venous blood leaves the brain mainly via the venous system of the other side of the neck and the ipsilateral collateral veins.

TI Effects of hypervolemia and hypertension on regional cerebral blood
   flow, intracranial pressure, and brain tissue oxygenation after
   subarachnoid hemorrhage
SO CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: Hypertensive, hypervolemic, hemodilution therapy (triple-H therapy) is a generally accepted treatment for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the particular role of the three components of triple-H therapy remains controversial. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the three arms of triple-H therapy on regional cerebral blood flow and brain tissue oxygenation.
   Design: Animal research and clinical intervention study.
   Setting: Surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.
   Subjects and Patients: Experiments were carried out in five healthy pigs, followed by a clinical investigation of ten patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   Interventions: First, we investigated the effect of the three components of triple-H therapy under physiologic conditions in an experimental pig model. In the next step we applied the same study protocol to patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Mean arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, cardiac output, regional cerebral blood flow, and brain tissue oxygenation were continuously recorded. Intrathoracic blood volume and central venous pressure were measured intermittently. Vasopressors and/or colloids and crystalloids were administered to stepwise establish the three components of triple-H therapy.
   Measurements and Main Results: In the animals, neither induced hypertension nor hypervolemia had an effect on intracranial pressure, brain tissue oxygenation, or regional cerebral blood flow. In the patient population, induction of hypertension (mean arterial pressure 143 +/- 10 mm Hg) resulted in a significant (P <.05) increase of regional cerebral blood flow and brain tissue oxygenation at all observation time points. In contrast, hypervolemia/hemodilution (intrathoracic blood volume index 1123 :L 152 mL/m(2)) induced only a slight increase of regional cerebral blood flow while brain tissue oxygenation did not improve. Finally, triple-H therapy failed to improve regional cerebral blood flow more than hypertension alone and was characterized by the drawback that the hypervolemia/hemodilution component reversed the effect of induced hypertension on brain tissue oxygenation.
   Conclusions: Vasopressor-induced elevation of mean arterial pressure caused a significant increase of regional cerebral blood flow and brain tissue oxygenation in all patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Volume expansion resulted in a slight effect on regional cerebral blood flow only but reversed the effect on brain tissue oxygenation. In view of the questionable benefit of hypervolemia on regional cerebral blood flow and the negative consequences on brain tissue oxygenation together with the increased risk of complications, hypervolemic therapy as a part of triple-H therapy should be applied with utmost caution.

TI Indomethacin and cerebral autoregulation in severe head injured
   patients: a transcranial Doppler study
SO ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA
AB Objective. To assess the effect of indomethacin on cerebral autoregulation, systemic and cerebral haemodynamics, in severe head trauma patients.
   Design. Prospective, controlled clinical trial, with repeated measurements.
   Settings. A 12-bed adult general intensive care unit in a third level referral university hospital.
   Patients. 16 severely head injured patients, 14 males, age range 17-60.
   Interventions. Indomethacin was administrated as a load plus continuous infusion. Indomethacin reactivity was assessed as the estimated cerebral blood flow change elicited by the load. Dynamic and static cerebral autoregulation tests were performed before indomethacin administration, and during its infusion.
   Measurements and main results. Systemic and cerebral haemodynamic changes were assessed through continuous monitoring of mean arterial pressure, transcranial Doppler cerebral blood flow velocity, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and jugular venous oxygen saturation. Indomethacin loading dose was immediately followed by a cerebral blood flow median decrease of 36 or 29% (p = ns) evaluated by two different methods, by an ICP decrease and by an AVDO(2) increase from 3.52 to 6.15 mL/dL (p = 0.002). Dynamic autoregulation increased from a median of 28 to 57% (p < 0.05) during indomethacin infusion; static autoregulation also increased, from a median of 72 to 89% (p = ns).
   Conclusions. Indomethacin decreased intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow, and increased cerebral perfusion pressure, while maintaining tissue properties of further extracting O-2. The increase in both autoregulatory values reveals an enhancement of cerebral microvasculature reactivity under indomethacin, during hypertensive and - especially - during hypotensive situations.

TI Cerebral venous thrombosis requiring invasive treatment for elevated
   intracranial pressure in women with combined hormonal contraceptive
   intake: risk factors, anatomical distribution, and clinical presentation
SO NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB OBJECTIVE Women taking combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) are generally considered to be at low risk for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). When it does occur, however, intensive care and neurosurgical management may, in rare cases, be needed for the control of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). The use of nonsurgical strategies such as barbiturate coma and induced hypothermia has never been reported in this context. The objective of this study is to determine predictive factors for invasive or surgical ICP treatment and the potential complications of nonsurgical strategies in this population.
   METHODS The authors conducted a 2-center, retrospective chart review of 168 cases of CVT in women between 2000 and 2012. Eligible patients were classified as having had a mild or a severe clinical course, the latter category including all patients who underwent invasive or surgical ICP treatment and all who had an unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score >= 3 or Glasgow Outcome Scale score <= 3). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for continuous parameters and Fisher's exact test for categorical parameters, and odds ratios were calculated with statistical significance set at p <= 0.05.
   RESULTS Of the 168 patients, 57 (age range 16-49 years) were determined to be eligible for the study. Six patients (10.5%) required invasive or surgical ICP treatment. Three patients (5.3%) developed refractory ICP > 30 mm Hg despite early surgical decompression; 2 of them (3.5%) were treated with barbiturate coma and induced hypothermia, with documented infectious, thromboembolic, and hemorrhagic complications. Coma on admission, thrombosis of the deep venous system with consecutive hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic venous infarction were associated with a higher frequency of surgical intervention. Coma, quadriparesis on admission, and hydrocephalus were more commonly seen among women with unfavorable outcomes. Thrombosis of the transverse sinus was less common in patients with an unfavorable outcome, with similar distribution in patients needing invasive or surgical ICP treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS The need for invasive or surgical ICP treatment in women taking CHCs who have CVT is partly predictable on the basis of the clinical and radiological findings on admission. The use of nonsurgical treatments for refractory ICP, such as barbiturate coma and induced hypothermia, is associated with systemic infectious and hematological complications and may worsen morbidity in this patient population. The significance of these factors should be studied in larger multicenter cohorts.

TI HYPERTONIC HYPERONCOTIC FLUID RESUSCITATION AFTER HEMORRHAGIC-SHOCK IN
   DOGS
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB We compared canine systemic and cerebral hemodynamics after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock with 4 mL/kg (a volume approximating 12% of shed blood volume) of 7.2% saline (HS; 1233 mEq/L sodium), 20% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) in 0.8% saline, or a combination fluid consisting of 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 7.2% saline (HS/HES).  Eighteen endotracheally intubated mongrel dogs (18-24 kg) were ventilated to maintain normocarbia with 0.5% halothane in nitrous oxide and oxygen (60:40).  After a 30-min period of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial blood pressure = 40 mm Hg), extending from time T0 to T30, animals received one of three randomly assigned intravenous resuscitation fluids:  HS, HES, or HS/HES.  Data were collected at baseline, at the beginning and end of the shock period (T0 and T30), immediately after fluid infusion (T35), and at 60-min intervals for 2 h (T95, T155).  After resuscitation, mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output increased similarly in all groups, but failed to return to baseline.  Intracranial pressure decreased during shock and increased slightly, immediately after resuscitation in all groups.  During shock, cerebral blood flow (cerebral venous outflow method) declined in all groups.  After resuscitation, cerebral blood flow increased, exceeding baseline in the HS and HS/HES groups but remaining low in the HES group (P < 0.05 HS vs HES at T35).  We conclude that small-volume resuscitation (4 mL/kg) with HS, HS/HES, or HES does not effectively restore or sustain systemic hemodynamics in hemorrhaged dogs.  In dogs without intracranial pathology, the effects on cerebral hemodynamics are also comparable, except for transiently greater cerebral blood flow in the HS group in comparison with the HES group.

TI Neurovascular coupling is not influenced by lower body negative pressure
   in humans
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY
AB Cerebral blood flow is tightly coupled with local neuronal activation and metabolism, i.e., neurovascular coupling (NVC). Studies suggest a role of sympathetic nervous system in the regulation of cerebral blood flow. However, this is controversial, and the sympathetic regulation of NVC in humans remains unclear. Since impaired NVC has been identified in several chronic diseases associated with a heightened sympathetic activity, we aimed to determine whether reflex-mediated sympathetic activation via lower body negative pressure (LBNP) attenuates NVC in humans. NVC was assessed using a visual stimulation protocol (5 cycles of 30 s eyes closed and 30 s of reading) in 11 healthy participants (aged 24 +/- 3 yr). NVC assessments were made under control conditions and during LBNP at -20 and -40 mmHg. Posterior (PCA) and middle (MCA) cerebral artery mean blood velocity (V-mean) and vertebral artery blood flow (VA(flow)) were simultaneously determined with cardiorespiratory variables. Under control conditions, the visual stimulation evoked a robust increase in PCA(vmean) (Delta 18.0 +/- 4.5%), a moderate rise in VA(flow) (Delta 9.6 +/- 4.3%), and a modest increase in MCA(vmean) (Delta 3.0 +/- 1.9%). The magnitude of NVC response was not affected by mild-to-moderate LBNP (all P > 0.05 for repeated-measures ANOVA). Given the small change that occurred in partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 during LBNP, this hypocapnia condition was matched via voluntary hyperventilation in absence of LBNP in a subgroup of participants (n = 8). The mild hypocapnia during LBNP did not exert a confounding influence on the NVC response. These findings indicate that the NVC is not influenced by LBNP or mild hypocapnia in humans.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Visual stimulation evoked a robust increase in posterior cerebral artery velocity and a modest increase in vertebral artery blood flow, i.e.. neurovascular coupling (NVC), which was unaffected by lower body negative pressure (LBNP) in humans. In addition, although LBNP induced a mild hypocapnia, this degree of hypocapnia in the absence of LBNP failed to modify the NVC response.

TI Sex-dependent jugular vein optical attenuation and distension during
   head-down tilt and lower body negative pressure
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB Non-contact coded hemodynamic imaging (CHI) is a novel wide-field near-infrared spectroscopy system which monitors blood volume by quantifying attenuation of light passing through the underlying vessels. This study tested the hypothesis that CHI-based jugular venous attenuation (JVA) would be larger in men, and change in JVA would be greater in men compared to women during two fluid shift challenges. The association of JVA with ultrasound-based cross-sectional area (CSA) was also tested. Ten men and 10 women completed three levels of head-down tilt (HDT) and four levels of lower body negative pressure (LBNP). Both JVA and CSA were increased by HDT and reduced by LBNP (all p < 0.001). Main effects of sex indicated that JVA was higher in men than women during both HDT (p = 0.003) and LBNP (p = 0.011). Interaction effects of sex and condition were observed for JVA during HDT (p = 0.005) and LBNP (p < 0.001). We observed moderate repeated-measures correlations (r(rm)) between JVA and CSA in women during HDT (r(rm) = 0.57, p = 0.011) and in both men (r(rm) = 0.74, p < 0.001) and women (r(rm) = 0.66, p < 0.001) during LBNP. While median within-person correlation coefficients indicated an even stronger association between JVA and CSA, this association became unreliable for small changes in CSA. As hypothesized, JVA was greater and changed more in men compared to women during both HDT and LBNP. CHI provides a non-contact method of tracking large changes in internal jugular vein blood volume that occur with acute fluid shifts, but data should be interpreted in a sex-dependent manner.

TI IS THERE A REASONABLE DIFFERENTIAL INDICATION FOR DIFFERENT
   HYDROCEPHALUS SHUNT SYSTEMS
SO CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB We tested various shunt systems for pressure/flow characteristics and long-term reliability. In addition, we used a model to simulate activities of daily life postural changes, blood and airway pressure changes and their impact on CSF pressure and flow through various ventriculo-peritoneal shunt systems. In the recumbent position, the changes in flow rate and CSF pressure depended on the valve resistance. Various valves showed deviations from the pressure/flow characteristics claimed for them and proved to be unreliable during long-term perfusion. The flow rate increased in the head-up position. Negative intracranial CSF pressure was due to the continued flow through the shunt system afforded by the siphon effect. The siphon effect was so marked in the upright position that valves of various kinds and with various resistances did not make any significant difference in the resulting intracranial pressure (ICP). The shunt systems, however, differed in the maximum flow rate in the upright position, leading to a different steep fail in ICP following elevation of the body. Ball-and-spring valves had the highest flow rates (> 500 ml/h), leading to negative ICP within seconds. Diaphragm valves, and especially the self-adjusting diaphragm valve, demonstrated a slower drop in ICP, taking several minutes to reach negative ICP. ASD and SCD, however, did prevent any siphoning effects, leading to an ICP within the corresponding valve opening/closing pressure range. Our results demonstrate that in most patients there is no significant difference in various different shunting systems as long as the patient is mobile. Different pressure values, however, may be important in bed-ridden patients with no postural hydrostatic CSF pressure changes. The difference in the drop in ICP during postural changes may be an important factor in a certain group of patients who are prone to negative pressure-dependent complications, e.g., slit-ventricle syndrome, subdural hematoma and hygroma. More important than the development of sophisticated new shunt systems is the maintenance of long-term durability and the ability to rely on the valves' characteristics.

TI Comparison of the cerebral effects of dopamine and norepinephrine in
   severely head-injured patients
SO INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
AB Objective: To compare the cerebral effects of dopamine and norepinephrine after severe head injury.
   Design: Prospective, clinical study.
   Setting: Surgical intensive care unit in a university hospital.
   Patients: Nineteen patients with severe head-injuries already requiring vasopressor therapy. Group 1: patients receiving dopamine (n = 9); group 2: patients receiving norepinephrine (n = 10).
   Intervention: Vasopressor therapy was switched from dopamine to norepinephrine in group 1 and from norepinephrine to dopamine in group 2, maintaining the same mean arterial pressure (MAP).
   Measurements and results: MAP, intracranial pressure (ICP), jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO(2)), transcranial Doppler mean velocity in the middle cerebral artery (Vm), and transoesophagal Doppler aortic output (AO) were evaluated under dopamine and norepinephrine. Means for each group were compared with the paired Student's t-test. For the same MAP, ICP was significantly higher with dopamine than norepinephrine in both groups (respectively, group 1: 26 +/- 11 vs 23 +/- 11 mmHg, P < 0.005; group 2: 39 +/- 13 vs 31 +/- 9 mmHg, P < 0.005). SjvO(2), Vm, and AO did not change significantly between treatments. The ICP variation between treatments was not correlated with the variation of any other measured parameter. The ICP variation between treatments was significantly higher in group 2 than group 1, which could be explained by autoregulation mechanisms.
   Conclusions: For the same MAP, ICP was significantly higher with dopamine than norepinephrine with no argument supporting an increase of cerebral blood flow.

TI Transverse venous stenting for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial
   hypertension, or pseudotumor cerebri
SO NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a commonly occurring disease, particularly among young women of child-bearing age. The underlying pathophysiology for this disease has remained largely unclear; however, the recent literature suggests that focal outflow obstruction of the transverse sinus may be the cause. The purpose of this study was to report one group's early experience with transverse venous sinus stenting in the treatment of IIH and assess its effectiveness.
   METHODS The authors performed a retrospective chart review to identify patients who had undergone stenting of an outflow-obstructed transverse venous sinus for the treatment of IIH at Gates Vascular Institute between January 2015 and November 2017. Patient demographic data of interest included age, sex, BMI, and history of smoking, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, hormonal contraceptive use, and acetazolamide therapy. Each patient's presenting signs and symptoms and whether those symptoms improved with treatment were reviewed. The average opening lumbar puncture (LP) pressure preprocedure, average pressure gradient across the obstructed segment prior to stenting, treatment failure rate (need for shunt placement), and mean follow-up period were calculated.
   RESULTS Of the 18 patients who had undergone transverse venous stenting for IIH, 16 (88.9%) were women. The mean age of all the patients was 38.3 years (median 38 years). Mean BMI was 34.2 kg/m(2) (median 33.9 kg/m(2)). Presenting symptoms were headache (16 patients [88.9%]), visual disturbances (13 patients [72.2%]), papilledema (8 patients [44.4%]), tinnitus (3 patients [16.7%]), and auditory bruit (3 patients [16.7%]). The mean opening LP pressure preprocedure was 35.6 cm H2O (median 32 cm H2O). The mean pressure gradient measured proximally and distally to the area of focal obstruction within the transverse sinus was 16.5 cm H2O (median 15 cm H2O). Postprocedurally, 14 patients (77.8%) continued to have headaches; 6 (33.3%) continued to have visual disturbances. No patients continued to have auditory bruit (0%) or papilledema (0%). One patient (5.6%) had new-onset tinnitus postprocedure. Overall improvement of symptoms was noted in 16 patients (88.9%) postprocedure, with 1 patient (5.6%) requiring shunt placement and 2 other patients (11.1%) requiring postprocedural LP to monitor intracranial pressure to determine candidacy for further surgical interventions to treat residual symptoms. The mean duration of follow-up was 194.2 days.
   CONCLUSIONS Transverse sinus stenting is a rapidly developing technique that has shown good effectiveness and safety in the literature. Authors of the present study found that stenting a flow-obstructed transverse sinus in patients with IIH was a safe and effective way to treat the condition.

TI Intracranial venous sinus stenting for the treatment of lateral sinus
   stenoses: An analysis of 200 patients
SO DIAGNOSTIC AND INTERVENTIONAL IMAGING
AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term efficacy and safety of intracranial venous sinus stenting in a large cohort of patients with any type of presentation of primary lateral venous sinus stenosis (VSS).
   Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed including patients treated by venous sinus stenting for symptomatic VSS from 2012 to 2019. Successful primary resolution of symptoms without adjunctive treatment or recurrence, and complications after stenting were analyzed at the last follow-up time point.
   Results: Two-hundred patients were included. There were 14 men and 186 women with a mean age of 39 +/- 14 (SD) years (age range: 13-75 years). Presenting symptoms included venous pulsatile tinnitus in 168 patients (168/200; 84%), idiopathic intracranial hypertension in 100 patients (100/200; 50%) and/or spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak in 35 patients (35/200; 17%). The overall rate of successful primary resolution of any typical presenting symptoms was 79% (95% CI: 73-85%). This rate ranged from 74% to 93% depending on the symptom with no significant difference between patients with and those without idiopathic intracranial hypertension (P = 0.08). Recurrence rate was 10% (95% CI: 6-14%). No death or permanent morbidity were observed during a median follow-up of 2.2 years (Q1, Q3: 1.4, 3.3; range: 1-7.7 years).
   Conclusion: Our study shows that venous sinus stenting has a low morbidity and high success rate at long-term follow-up for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, venous pulsatile tinnitus or spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak associated with VSS. The excellent safety suggests considering this treatment as first-line treatment when medical management is ineffective or poorly tolerated. (C) 2021 Societe francaise de radiologie.

TI A Unique Subset: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Presenting as
   Spontaneous CSF Leak of the Anterior Skull Base
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY PART B-SKULL BASE
AB Background Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks represent a unique clinical presentation of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), lacking classical features of IIH, including severe headaches, papilledema, and markedly elevated opening pressures.
   Methods Following a single-institution retrospective review of patients undergoing spontaneous CSF leak repair, we performed a literature review of spontaneous CSF leak in patients previously undiagnosed with IIH, querying PubMed.
   Results Our literature review yielded 26 studies, comprising 716 patients. Average age was 51 years with 80.8% female predominance, and average body mass index was 35.5. Presenting symptoms included headaches (32.5%), visual disturbances (4.2%), and a history of meningitis (15.3%). Papilledema occurred in 14.1%. An empty sella was present in 77.7%. Slit ventricles and venous sinus stenosis comprised 7.7 and 31.8%, respectively. CSF leak most commonly originated from the sphenoid sinus (41.1%), cribriform plate (25.4%), and ethmoid skull base (20.4%). Preoperative opening pressures were normal at 22.4cm H (2) O and elevated postoperatively to 30.8cm H (2) O. 19.1% of patients underwent shunt placement. CSF leak recurred after repair in 10.5% of patients, 78.6% involving the initial site. A total of 85.7% of these patients were managed with repeat surgical intervention, and 23.2% underwent a shunting procedure.
   Conclusion Spontaneous CSF leaks represent a distinct variant of IIH, distinguished by decreased prevalence of headaches, lack of visual deficits, and normal opening pressures. Delayed measurement of opening pressure after leak repair may be helpful to diagnose IIH. Permanent CSF diversion may be indicated in patients exhibiting significantly elevated opening pressures postoperatively, refractory symptoms of IIH, or recurrent CSF leak.
